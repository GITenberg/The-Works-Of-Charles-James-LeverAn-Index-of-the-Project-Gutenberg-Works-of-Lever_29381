      THE CONFESSIONS OF HARRY LORREQUER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      [By Charles James Lever (1806-1872)]

    <p>
      Though the title page has no author's name inscribed, this work is
      generally attributed to Charles James Lever. Harry Lorrequer was a young
      officer in a British regiment stationed in Ireland in the early 1800's.
      The 1839 First Edition had pages too stained and friable for scanning&mdash;so
      a colleague, Mary Munarin, helped prepare this eBook for Project Gutenberg
      in the old fashioned way&mdash;she typed it! This story will be a delight
      to any readers with a few drops of Irish blood (or a wee drop of the Old
      Bushmills) in their veins.

<br />Disputing "one brandy too much" in his bill
<br />Empty, valueless, heartless flirtation
<br />Ending&mdash;I never yet met the man who could tell when it ended
<br />Enjoy the name without the gain
<br />Enough is as good as a feast
<br />Escaped shot and shell to fall less gloriously beneath champagne

<br />Had to hear the "proud man's contumely"
<br />Half pleased and whole frightened with the labour before him

<br />Mistaking zeal for inclination
<br />Mistaking your abstraction for attention
<br />My English proves me Irish
<br />My French always shows me to be English
<br />Never able to restrain myself from a propensity to make love
<br />Nine-inside  leathern "conveniency," bumping ten miles an hour
<br />No equanimity like his who acts as your second in a duel
<br />Nothing seemed extravagant to hopes so well founded
<br />Nothing ever makes a man so agreeable as the belief that he is
<br />Now, young ladies, come along, and learn something, if you can

<br />Rather a dabbler in the "ologies"

<br />Respectable heir-loom of infirmity
<br />Seems ever to accompany dullness a sustaining power of vanity
<br />Sixteenthly, like a Presbyterian minister's sermon
<br />Stoicism which preludes sending your friend out of the world
<br />Strong opinions against tobacco within doors
<br />Suppose I have laughed at better men than ever he was
<br />Sure if he did, doesn't he take it out o' me in the corns?
<br />That vanity which wine inspires
<br />That "to stand was to fall,"
<br />That land of punch, priests, and potatoes
<br />The divil a bit better she was nor a pronoun
<br />The tone of assumed compassion
<br />The "fat, fair, and forty" category
<br />There are unhappily impracticable people in the world
<br />There is no infatuation like the taste for flirtation
<br />They were so perfectly contented with their self-deception
<br />Time, that 'pregnant old gentleman,' will disclose all
<br />Unwashed hands, and a heavy gold ring upon his thumb
<br />Vagabond if Providence had not made me a justice of the peace
<br />We pass a considerable portion of our lives in a mimic warfare
<br />What will not habit accomplish
<br />What we wish, we readily believe
<br />When you pretended to be pleased, unluckily, I believed you
<br />Whenever he was sober his poverty disgusted him
<br />Whiskey, the appropriate liquor in all treaties of this nature
<br />Whose paraphrase of the book of Job was refused
<br />Wretched, gloomy-looking picture of woe-begone poverty

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
