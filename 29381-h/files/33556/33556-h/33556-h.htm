    <h2>
      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am unwilling to suffer this tale to leave my hands without a word of
      explanation to my reader. If I have never disguised from myself the
      grounds of any humble success I have attained to as a writer of fiction;
      if I have always had before me the fact that to movement and action, the
      stir of incident, and a certain light-heartedness and gayety of
      temperament, more easy to impart to others than to repress in one's self,
      I have owed much, if not all, of whatever popularity I have enjoyed, I
      have yet felt, or fancied that I felt, that it would be in the delineation
      of very different scenes, and the portraiture of very different emotions,
      that I should reap what I would reckon as a real success. This conviction,
      or impression if you will, has become stronger with years and with the
      knowledge of life; years have imparted, and time has but confirmed me in,
      the notion that any skill I possess lies in the detection of character,
      and the unravelment of that tangled skein which makes up human motives.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am well aware that no error is more common than to mistake one's own
      powers; nor does anything more contribute to this error than a sense of
      self-depreciation for what the world has been pleased to deem successful
      in us. To test my conviction, or to abandon it as a delusion forever, I
      have written the present story of "Glencore."
    </p>
    <p>
      I make but little pretension to the claim of interesting; as little do I
      aspire to the higher credit of instructing. All I have attempted-all I
      have striven to accomplish-is the faithful portraiture of character, the
      close analysis of motives, and correct observation as to some of the
      manners and modes of thought which mark the age we live in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opportunities of society as well as natural inclination have alike
      disposed me to such studies. I have stood over the game of life very
      patiently for many a year, and though I may have grieved over the narrow
      fortune which has prevented me from "cutting in," I have consoled myself
      by the thought of all the anxieties defeat might have cost me, all the
      chagrin I had suffered were I to have risen a loser. Besides this, I have
      learned to know and estimate what are the qualities which win success in
      life, and what the gifts by which men dominate above their fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      If in the world of well-bred life the incidents and events be fewer,
      because the friction is less than in the classes where vicissitudes of
      fortune are more frequent, the play of passion, the moods of temper, and
      the changeful varieties of nature are often very strongly developed,
      shadowed and screened though they be by the polished conventionalities of
      society. To trace and mark these has long constituted one of the pleasures
      of my life; if I have been able to impart even a portion of that
      gratification to my reader, I will not deem the effort in vain, nor the
      "Fortunes of Glencore" a failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me add that although certain traits of character in some of the
      individuals of my story may seem to indicate sketches of real personages,
      there is but one character in the whole book drawn entirely from life.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is Billy Traynor. Not only have I had a sitter for this picture, but
      he is alive and hearty at the hour I am writing. For the others, they are
      purely, entirely fictitious. Certain details, certain characteristics, I
      have of course borrowed,&mdash;as he who would mould a human face must
      needs have copied an eye, a nose, or a chin from some existent model; but
      beyond this I have not gone, nor, indeed, have I found, in all my
      experience of life, that fiction ever suggests what has not been implanted
      unconsciously by memory; originality in the delineation of character being
      little beyond a new combination of old materials derived from that source.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish I could as easily apologize for the faults and blemishes of my
      story as I can detect and deplore them; but, like the failings in one's
      nature, they are very often difficult to correct, even when acknowledged.
      I have, therefore, but to throw myself once more upon the indulgence
      which, "old offender" that I am, has never forsaken me, and subscribe
      myself,
    </p>
    <p>
      Your devoted friend and servant,

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. A LONELY LANDSCAPE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Where that singularly beautiful inlet of the sea known in the west of
      Ireland as the Killeries, after narrowing to a mere strait, expands into a
      bay, stands the ruin of the ancient Castle of Glencore. With the bold
      steep sides of Ben Creggan behind, and the broad blue Atlantic in front,
      the proud keep would seem to have occupied a spot that might have bid
      defiance to the boldest assailant. The estuary itself here seems entirely
      landlocked, and resembles, in the wild, fantastic outline of the mountains
      around, a Norwegian fiord, rather than a scene in our own tamer landscape.
      The small village of Leenane, which stands on the Galway shore, opposite
      to Glencore, presents the only trace of habitation in this wild and
      desolate district, for the country around is poor, and its soil offers
      little to repay the task of the husbandman. Fishing is then the chief, if
      not the sole, resource of those who pass their lives in this solitary
      region; and thus in every little creek or inlet of the shore may be seen
      the stout craft of some hardy venturer, and nets, and tackle, and
      such-like gear, lie drying on every rocky eminence. We have said that
      Glencore was a ruin; but still its vast proportions, yet traceable in
      massive fragments of masonry, displayed specimens of various eras of
      architecture, from the rudest tower of the twelfth century to the more
      ornate style of a later period; while artificial embankments and sloped
      sides of grass showed the remains of what once had been terrace and
      "parterre," the successors, it might be presumed, of fosse and parapet.
      Many a tale of cruelty and oppression, many a story of suffering and
      sorrow, clung to those old walls, for they had formed the home of a
      haughty and a cruel race, the last descendant of which died at the close
      of the past century. The Castle of Glencore, with the title, had now
      descended to a distant relation of the house, who had repaired and so far
      restored the old residence as to make it habitable,&mdash;that is to say,
      four bleak and lofty chambers were rudely furnished, and about as many
      smaller ones fitted for servant accommodation; but no effort at
      embellishment, not even the commonest attempt at neatness, was bestowed on
      the grounds or the garden; and in this state it remained for some
      five-and-twenty or thirty years, when the tidings reached the little
      village of Leenane that his lordship was about to return to Glencore, and
      fix his residence there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such an event was of no small moment in such a locality, and many were the
      speculations as to what might be the consequence of his coming. Little, or
      indeed nothing, was known of Lord Glencore; his only visit to the
      neighborhood had occurred many years before, and lasted but for a day. He
      had arrived suddenly, and, taking a boat at the ferry, as it was called,
      crossed over to the Castle, whence he returned at nightfall, to depart as
      hurriedly as he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of those who had seen him in this brief visit the accounts were vague and
      most contradictory. Some called him handsome and well built; others said
      he was a dark-looking, downcast man, with a sickly and forbidding aspect.
      None, however, could record one single word he had spoken, nor could even
      gossips pretend to say that he gave utterance to any opinion about the
      place or the people. The mode in which the estate was managed gave as
      little insight into the character of the proprietor. If no severity was
      displayed to the few tenants on the property, there was no encouragement
      given to their efforts at improvement; a kind of cold neglect was the only
      feature discernible, and many went so far as to say that if any cared to
      forget the payment of his rent, the chances were it might never be
      demanded of him; the great security against such a venture, however, lay
      in the fact that the land was held at a mere nominal rental, and few would
      have risked his tenure by such an experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was little to be wondered at that Lord Glencore was not better known in
      that secluded spot, since even in England his name was scarcely heard of.
      His fortune was very limited, and he had no political influence whatever,
      not possessing a seat in the Upper House; so that, as he spent his life
      abroad, he was almost totally forgotten in his own country.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that Debrett could tell of him was comprised in a few lines, recording
      simply that he was sixth Viscount Glencore and Loughdooner; born in the
      month of February, 180-, and married in August, 18&mdash;, to Clarissa
      Isabella, second daughter of Sir Guy Clifford, of Wytchley, Baronet; by
      whom he had issue, Charles Conyngham Massey, born 6th June, 18&mdash;.
      There closed the notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange and quaint things are these short biographies, with little beyond
      the barren fact that "he had lived" and "he had died;" and yet, with all
      the changes of this work-a-day world, with its din, and turmoil, and
      gold-seeking, and "progress," men cannot divest themselves of reverence
      for birth and blood, and the veneration for high descent remains an
      instinct of humanity. Sneer as men will at "heaven-born legislators,"
      laugh as you may at the "tenth transmitter of a foolish face," there is
      something eminently impressive in the fact of a position acquired by deeds
      that date back to centuries, and preserved inviolate to the successor of
      him who fought at Agincourt or at Cressy. If ever this religion shall be
      impaired, the fault be with those who have derogated from their great
      prerogative, and forgotten to make illustrious by example what they have
      inherited illustrious by descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the news first reached the neighborhood that a lord was about to take
      up his residence in the Castle, the most extravagant expectations were
      conceived of the benefits to arise from such a source. The very humblest
      already speculated on the advantages his wealth was to diffuse, and the
      thousand little channels into which his affluence would be directed. The
      ancient traditions of the place spoke of a time of boundless profusion,
      when troops of mounted followers used to accompany the old barons, and
      when the lough itself used to be covered with boats, with the armorial
      bearings of Glencore floating proudly from their mastheads. There were old
      men then living who remembered as many as two hundred laborers being daily
      employed on the grounds and gardens of the Castle; and the most fabulous
      stories were told of fortunes accumulated by those who were lucky enough
      to have saved the rich earnings of that golden period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colored as such speculations were with all the imaginative warmth of the
      west, it was a terrible shock to such sanguine fancies when they beheld a
      middle-aged, sad-looking man arrive in a simple postchaise, accompanied by
      his son, a child of six or seven years of age, and a single servant,&mdash;a
      grim-looking old dragoon corporal, who neither invited intimacy nor
      rewarded it. It was not, indeed, for a long time that they could believe
      that this was "my lord," and that this solitary attendant was the whole of
      that great retinue they had so long been expecting; nor, indeed, could any
      evidence less strong than Mrs. Mulcahy's, of the Post-office, completely
      satisfy them on the subject. The address of certain letters and newspapers
      to the Lord Viscount Glencore was, however, a testimony beyond dispute; so
      that nothing remained but to revenge themselves on the unconscious author
      of their self-deception for the disappointment he gave them. This, it is
      true, required some ingenuity, for they scarcely ever saw him, nor could
      they ascertain a single fact of his habits or mode of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never crossed the "Lough," as the inlet of the sea, about three miles
      in width, was called. He as rigidly excluded the peasantry from the
      grounds of the Castle; and, save an old fisherman, who carried his
      letter-bag to and fro, and a few laborers in the spring and autumn, none
      ever invaded the forbidden precincts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, such privacy paid its accustomed penalty; and many an
      explanation, of a kind little flattering, was circulated to account for so
      ungenial an existence. Some alleged that he had committed some heavy crime
      against the State, and was permitted to pass his life there, on the
      condition of perpetual imprisonment; others, that his wife had deserted
      him, and that in his forlorn condition he had sought out a spot to live
      and die in, unnoticed and unknown; a few ascribed his solitude to debt;
      while others were divided in opinion between charges of misanthropy and
      avarice,&mdash;to either of which accusations his lonely and simple life
      fully exposed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In time, however, people grew tired of repeating stories to which no new
      evidence added any features of interest. They lost the zest for a scandal
      which ceased to astonish, and "my lord" was as much forgotten, and his
      existence as unspoken of, as though the old towers had once again become
      the home of the owl and the jackdaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now about eight years since "the lord" had taken up his abode at
      the Castle, when one evening, a raw and gusty night of December, the
      little skiff of the fisherman was seen standing in for shore,&mdash;a
      sight somewhat uncommon, since she always crossed the "Lough" in time for
      the morning's mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's another man aboard, too," said a bystander from the little group
      that watched the boat, as she neared the harbor; "I think it's Mr.
      Craggs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 're right enough, Sam,&mdash;it's the Corporal; I know his cap, and
      the short tail of hair he wears under it. What can bring him at this time
      of night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's going to bespeak a quarter of Tim Healey's beef, maybe," said one,
      with a grin of malicious drollery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mayhap it's askin' us all to spend the Christmas he'd be," said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whisht! or he 'll hear you," muttered a third; and at the same instant
      the sail came clattering down, and the boat glided swiftly past, and
      entered a little natural creek close beneath where they stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who has got a horse and a jaunting-car?" cried the Corporal, as he jumped
      on shore. "I want one for Clifden directly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's fifteen miles&mdash;devil a less," cried one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fifteen! no, but eighteen! Kiely's bridge is brack down, and you 'll have
      to go by Gortnamuck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, and if he has, can't he take the cut?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He can't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? Did n't I go that way last week?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, and if you did, did n't you lame your baste?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'T was n't the cut did it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was&mdash;sure I know better&mdash;Billy Moore tould me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Billy's a liar!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Such and such-like comments and contradictions were very rapidly
      exchanged, and already the debate was waxing warm, when Mr. Craggs's
      authoritative voice interposed with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Billy Moore be blowed! I want to know if I can have a car and horse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure! why not?&mdash;who says you can't?" chimed in a chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you go to Clifden under five hours my name isn't Terry Lynch," said an
      old man in rabbitskin breeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll engage, if Barny will give me the blind mare, to drive him there
      under four."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bother!" said the Rabbitskin, in a tone of contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where's the horse?" cried the Corporal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, that's it," said another; "where's the horse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there none to be found in the village?" asked Craggs, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Divil a horse, barrin' an ass. Barny's mare has the staggers the last
      fortnight, and Mrs. Kyle's pony broke his two knees on Tuesday carrying
      sea-weed up the rocks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I must go to Clifden; I must be there to-night," said Craggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's on foot, then, you'll have to do it," said the Rabbitskin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord Glencore's dangerously ill, and needs a doctor," said the Corporal,
      bursting out with a piece of most uncommon communicativeness. "Is there
      none of you will give his horse for such an errand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arrah, musha!&mdash;it's a pity!" and such-like expressions of
      compassionate import, were muttered on all sides; but no more active
      movement seemed to flow from the condolence, while in a lower tone were
      added such expressions as, "Sorra mend him&mdash;if he wasn't a naygar,
      wouldn't he have a horse of his own? It's a droll lord he is, to be
      begging the loan of a baste!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Something like a malediction arose to the Corporal's lips; but restraining
      it, and with a voice thick from passion, he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm ready to pay you&mdash;to pay you ten times over the worth of your&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You need n't curse the horse, anyhow," interposed Rabbitskin, while with
      a significant glance at his friends around him, he slyly intimated that it
      would be as well to adjourn the debate,&mdash;a motion as quickly obeyed
      as it was mooted; for in less than five minutes Craggs was standing beside
      the quay, with no other companion than a blind beggar-woman, who,
      perfectly regardless of his distress, continued energetically to draw
      attention to her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little fivepenny bit, my lord&mdash;the last trifle your honor's glory
      has in the corner of your pocket, that you 'll never miss, and that 'll
      sweeten ould Molly's tay to-night? There, acushla, have pity on 'the
      dark,' and that you may see glory&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Craggs did not wait for the remainder, but, deep in his own thoughts,
      sauntered down towards the village. Already had the others retreated
      within their homes; and now all was dark and cheerless along the little
      straggling street.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this is a Christian country!&mdash;this a land that people tell you
      abounds in kindness and good-nature!" said he, in an accent of sarcastic
      bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who'll say the reverse?" answered a voice from behind, and, turning,
      he beheld the little hunchbacked fellow who carried the mail on foot from
      Oughterard, a distance of sixteen miles, over a mountain, and who was
      popularly known as "Billy the Bag," from the little leather sack which
      seemed to form part of his attire. "Who 'll stand up and tell me it's not
      a fine country in every sense,&mdash;for natural beauties, for
      antiquities, for elegant men and lovely females, for quarries of marble
      and mines of gould?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Craggs looked contemptuously at the figure who thus declaimed of Ireland's
      wealth and grandeur, and, in a sneering tone, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "And with such riches on every side, why do you go barefoot&mdash;why are
      you in rags, my old fellow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is n't there poor everywhere? If the world was all gould and silver, what
      would be the precious metals&mdash;tell me that? Is it because there's a
      little cripple like myself here, that them mountains yonder is n't of
      copper and iron and cobalt? Come over with me after I lave the bags at the
      office, and I 'll show you bits of every one I speak of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd rather you'd show me a doctor, my worthy fellow," said Craggs,
      sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm the nearest thing to that same going," replied Billy. "I can breathe
      a vein against any man in the barony. I can't say, that for any articular
      congestion of the aortic valves, or for a sero-pulmonic diathesis&mdash;d'ye
      mind?&mdash;that there isn't as good as me; but for the ould school of
      physic, the humoral diagnostic touch, who can beat me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you come with me across the lough, and see my lord, then?" said
      Craggs, who was glad even of such aid in his emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why not, when I lave the bags?" said Billy, touching the leather sack
      as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Corporal was not without his misgivings as to the skill and
      competence of his companion, there was something in the fluent volubility
      of the little fellow that overawed and impressed him, while his words were
      uttered in a rich mellow voice, that gave them a sort of solemn
      persuasiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you always on the road?" asked the Corporal, curious to learn some
      particulars of his history.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir; I was twenty things before I took to the bags. I was a poor
      scholar for four years; I kept school in Erris; I was 'on' the ferry in
      Dublin with my fiddle for eighteen months; and I was a bear in Liverpool
      for part of a winter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A bear!" exclaimed Craggs. "Yes, sir. It was an Italian&mdash;one Pipo
      Chiassi by name&mdash;that lost his beast at Manchester, and persuaded me,
      as I was about the same stature, to don the sable, and perform in his
      place. After that I took to writin' for the papers&mdash;'The Skibbereen
      Celt'&mdash;and supported myself very well till it broke. But here we are
      at the office, so I 'll step in, and get my fiddle, too, if you 've no
      objection."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Corporal's meditations scarcely were of a kind to reassure him, as he
      thought over the versatile character of his new friend; but the case
      offered no alternative&mdash;it was Billy or nothing&mdash;since to reach
      Clifden on foot would be the labor of many hours, and in the interval his
      master should be left utterly alone. While he was thus musing, Billy
      reappeared, with a violin under one arm and a much-worn quarto under the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This," said he, touching the volume, "is the 'Whole Art and Mystery of
      Physic,' by one Fabricius, of Aquapendente; and if we don't find a cure
      for the case down here, take my word for it, it's among the <i>morba
      ignota</i>, as Paracelsus says."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, come along," said Craggs, impatiently, and set off at a speed that,
      notwithstanding Billy's habits of foot-travel, kept him at a sharp trot. A
      few minutes more saw them, with canvas spread, skimming across the lough,
      towards Glencore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glencore&mdash;Glencore!" muttered Billy once or twice to himself, as the
      swift boat bounded through the hissing surf. "Did you ever hear Lady
      Lucy's Lament?" And he struck a few chords with his fingers as he sang:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "'I care not for your trellised vine,
        I love the dark woods on the shore,
     Nor all the towers along the Rhine
         Are dear to me as old Glencore.

     The ragged cliff, Ben Creggan high,
         Re-echoing the Atlantic roar,
     Are mingling with the seagull's cry
         My welcome back to old Glencore.'
</pre>
    <p>
      And then there's a chorus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a signal to us to make haste," said the Corporal, pointing to a
      bright flame which suddenly shot up on the shore of the lough. "Put out an
      oar to leeward there, and keep her up to the wind."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Billy, perceiving his minstrelsy unattended to, consoled himself by
      humming over, for his own amusement, the remainder of his ballad.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind freshened as the night grew darker, and heavy seas repeatedly
      broke on the bow, and swept over the boat in sprayey showers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's that confounded song of yours has got the wind up," said Craggs,
      angrily; "stand by the sheet, and stop your croning!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's an <i>error vulgaris</i>, attributing to music marine disasters,"
      said Billy, calmly; "it arose out of a mistake about one Orpheus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slack off there!" cried Craggs, as a squall struck the boat, and laid her
      almost over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy, however, had obeyed the mandate promptly, and she soon righted, and
      held on her course.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish they'd show the light again on shore," muttered the Corporal; "the
      night is black as pitch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep the top of the mountain a little to windward, and you 're all
      right," said Billy. "I know the lough well; I used to come here all hours,
      day and night, once, spearing salmon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And smuggling, too!" added Craggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; brandy, and tay, and pigtail, for Mister Sheares, in
      Oughterard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What became of him?" asked Craggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He made a fortune and died, and his son married a lady!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here comes another; throw her head up in the wind," cried Craggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the order came too late; for the squall struck her with the
      suddenness of a shot, and she canted over till her keel lay out of water,
      and, when she righted, it was with the white surf boiling over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's a good boat, then, to stand that," said Billy, as he struck a light
      for his pipe, with all the coolness of one perfectly at his ease; and
      Craggs, from that very moment, conceived a favorable opinion of the little
      hunchback.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now we're in the smooth water, Corporal," cried Billy; "let her go a
      little free."
    </p>
    <p>
      And, obedient to the advice, he ran the boat swiftly along till she
      entered a small creek, so sheltered by the highlands that the water within
      was still as a mountain tarn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You never made the passage on a worse night, I 'll be bound," said
      Craggs, as he sprang on shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed and I did, then," replied Billy. "I remember&mdash;it was two days
      before Christmas&mdash;we were blown out to say in a small boat, not more
      than the half of this, and we only made the west side of Arran Island
      after thirty-six hours' beating and tacking. I wrote an account of it for
      the 'Tyrawly Regenerator,' commencing with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The elemential conflict that with tremendious violence raged, ravaged,
      and ruined the adamantine foundations of our western coast, on Tuesday,
      the 23rd of December&mdash;'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along, come along," said Craggs; "we've something else to think of."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with this admonition, very curtly bestowed, he stepped out briskly on
      the path towards Glencore.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. GLENCORE CASTLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the Corporal, followed by Billy, entered the gloomy hall of the
      Castle, they found two or three country people conversing in a low but
      eager voice together, who speedily turned towards them, to learn if the
      doctor had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here 's all I could get in the way of a doctor," said Craggs, pushing
      Billy towards them as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix, and ye might have got worse," muttered a very old man; "Billy
      Traynor has the lucky hand.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is my lord, now, Nelly?" asked the Corporal of a woman who, with bare
      feet, and dressed in the humblest fashion of the peasantry, appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's getting weaker and weaker, sir; I believe he's sinking. I'm glad
      it's Billy is come; I'd rather see him than all the doctors in the
      country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Follow me," said Craggs, giving a signal to step lightly; and he led the
      way up a narrow stone stair, with a wall on either hand. Traversing a
      long, low corridor, they reached a door, at which having waited for a
      second or two to listen, Craggs turned the handle and entered. The room
      was very large and lofty, and, seen in the dim light of a small lamp upon
      the hearthstone, seemed even more spacious than it was. The oaken floor
      was uncarpeted, and a very few articles of furniture occupied the walls.
      In one corner stood a large bed, the heavy curtains of which had been
      gathered up on the roof, the better to admit air to the sick man.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Billy drew nigh with cautious steps, he perceived that, although worn
      and wasted by long illness, the patient was a man still in the very prime
      of life. His dark hair and beard, which he wore long, were untinged with
      gray, and his forehead showed no touch of age. His dark eyes were wide
      open, and his lips slightly parted, his whole features exhibiting an
      expression of energetic action, even to wildness. Still he was sleeping;
      and, as Craggs whispered, he seldom slept otherwise, even when in health.
      With all the quietness of a trained practitioner, Billy took down the
      watch that was pinned to the curtain and proceeded to count the pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A hundred and thirty-eight," muttered he, as he finished; and then,
      gently displacing the bedclothes, laid his hand upon the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a long-drawn sigh, like that of utter weariness, the sick man moved
      his head round and fixed his eyes upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The doctor!" said he, in a deep-toned but feeble voice. "Leave me, Craggs&mdash;leave
      me alone with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Corporal slowly retired, turning as he went to look back towards
      the bed, and evidently going with reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it fever?" asked the sick man, in a faint but unfaltering accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a kind of cerebral congestion,&mdash;a matter of them membranes
      that's over the brain, with, of course, <i>febrilis generalis</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      The accentuation of these words, marked as it was by the strongest
      provincialism of the peasant, attracted the sick man's attention, and he
      bent upon him a look at once searching and severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you&mdash;who are you?" cried he, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I am is n't so aisy to say; but who I am is clean beyond me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you a doctor?" asked the sick man, fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afear'd I'm not, in the sense of a <i>gradum Universitatis</i>,&mdash;a
      diplomia; but sure maybe Paracelsus himself just took to it, like me,
      having a vocation, as one might say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ring that bell," said the other, peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Billy obeyed without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by this, Craggs?" said the Viscount, trembling with
      passion. "Who have you brought me? What beggar have you picked off the
      highway? Or is he the travelling fool of the district?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the anger that supplied strength hitherto now failed to impart energy,
      and he sank back wasted and exhausted. The Corporal bent over him, and
      spoke something in a low whisper, but whether the words were heard or not,
      the sick man now lay still, breathing heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you do nothing for him?" asked Craggs, peevishly&mdash;"nothing but
      anger him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure I can if you let me," said Billy, producing a very ancient
      lancet-case of boxwood tipped with ivory. "I'll just take a dash of blood
      from the temporal artery, to relieve the cerebrum, and then we'll put
      cowld on his head, and keep him quiet."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a promptitude that showed at least self-confidence, he proceeded
      to accomplish the operation, every step of which he effected skilfully and
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, now," said he, feeling the pulse, as the blood continued to flow
      freely, "the circulation is relieved at once; it's the same as opening a
      sluice in a mill-dam. He 's better already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He looks easier," said Craggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, and he feels it," continued Billy. "Just notice the respiratory
      organs, and see how easy the intercostials is doing their work now. Bring
      me a bowl of clean water, some vinegar, and any ould rags you have."
    </p>
    <p>
      Craggs obeyed, but not without a sneer at the direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All over the head," said Billy; "all over it,&mdash;back and front,&mdash;and
      with the blessing of the Virgin, I'll have that hair off of him if he is
      n't cooler towards evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he covered the sick man with the wetted cloths, and bathed his
      hands in the cooling fluid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now to exclude the light and save the brain from stimulation and
      excitation," said Billy, with a pompous enunciation of the last syllables;
      "and then <i>quies</i>&mdash;rest&mdash;peace!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And with this direction, imparted with a caution to enforce its benefits,
      he moved stealthily towards the door and passed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think of him?" asked the Corporal, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He 'll do&mdash;he 'll do," said Billy. "He's a sanguineous temperament,
      and he'll bear the lancet. It's just like weatherin' a point at say. If
      you have a craft that will carry canvas, there's always a chance for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He perceived that you were not a doctor," said Craggs, when they reached
      the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he, faix?" cried Billy, half indignantly. "He might have perceived
      that I did n't come in a coach; that I had n't my hair powdered, nor gold
      knee-buckles in my smallcloths; but, for all that, it would be going too
      far to say that I was n't a doctor! 'T is the same with physic and poetry&mdash;you
      take to it, or you don't take to it! There's chaps, ay, and far from
      stupid ones either, that could n't compose you ten hexameters if ye'd put
      them on a hot griddle for it; and there's others that would talk rhyme
      rather than rayson! And so with the <i>ars medicatrix</i>&mdash;everybody
      has n't an eye for a hectic, or an ear for a cough&mdash;<i>non contigit
      cuique adire Corintheum</i>. 'T is n't every one can toss pancakes, as
      Horace says."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush&mdash;be still!" muttered Craggs, "here's the young master." And as
      he spoke, a youth of about fifteen, well grown and handsome, but poorly,
      even meanly clad, approached them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen my father? What do you think of him?" asked he, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis a critical state he's in, your honor," said Billy, bowing; "but I
      think he 'll come round&mdash;<i>deplation, deplation, deplation&mdash;actio,
      actio, actio</i>; relieve the gorged vessels, and don't drown the grand
      hydraulic machine, the heart&mdash;them's my sentiments."
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning from the speaker with a look of angry impatience, the boy
      whispered some words in the Corporal's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What could I do, sir?" was the answer; "it was this fellow or nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And better, a thousand times better, nothing," said the boy, "than trust
      his life to the coarse ignorance of this wretched quack." And in his
      passion the words were uttered loud enough for Billy to overhear them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be hasty, your honor," said Billy, submissively, "and don't be
      unjust. The realms of disaze is like an unknown tract of country, or a
      country that's only known a little, just round the coast, as it might be;
      once ye're beyond that, one man is as good a guide as another, <i>coeteris
      paribus</i>, that is, with 'equal lights.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you done? Have you given him anything?" broke in the boy,
      hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I took a bleeding from him, little short of sixteen ounces, from the
      temporial," said Billy, proudly, "and I'll give him now a concoction of
      meadow saffron with a pinch of saltpetre in it, to cause diaphoresis, d'ye
      mind? Meanwhile, we're disgorging the arachnoid membranes with cowld
      applications, and we're relievin' the cerebellum by repose. I challenge
      the Hall," added Billy, stoutly, "to say is n't them the grand principles
      of 'traitment.' Ah! young gentleman," said he, after a few seconds' pause,
      "don't be hard on me, because I 'm poor and in rags, nor think manely of
      me because I spake with a brogue, and maybe bad grammar, for, you see,
      even a crayture of my kind can have a knowledge of disaze, just as he may
      have a knowledge of nature, by observation. What is sickness, after all,
      but just one of the phenomenons of all organic and inorganic matter&mdash;a
      regular sort of shindy in a man's inside, like a thunderstorm, or a
      hurry-cane outside? Watch what's coming, look out and see which way the
      mischief is brewin', and make your preparations. That's the great study of
      physic."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy listened patiently and even attentively to this speech, and when
      Billy had concluded, he turned to the Corporal and said, "Look to him,
      Craggs, and let him have his supper, and when he has eaten it send him to
      my room."
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy bowed an acknowledgment, and followed the Corporal to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's my lord's son, I suppose," said he, as he seated himself, "and a
      fine young crayture too&mdash;<i>puer ingenuus</i>, with a grand frontal
      development." And with this reflection he addressed himself to the coarse
      but abundant fare which Craggs placed before him, and with an appetite
      that showed how much he relished it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is elegant living ye have here, Mr. Craggs," said Billy, as he
      drained his tankard of beer, and placed it with a sigh on the table; "many
      happy years of it to ye&mdash;I could n't wish ye anything better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The life is not so bad," said Craggs, "but it's lonely sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life need never be lonely so long as a man has health and his faculties,"
      said Billy; "give me nature to admire, a bit of baycon for dinner, and my
      fiddle to amuse me, and I would n't change with the King of Sugar
      'Candy.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was there," said Craggs, "it's a fine island."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord wants to see the doctor," said a woman, entering hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the doctor is ready for him," said Billy, rising and leaving the
      kitchen with all the dignity he could assume.

      CHAPTER III. BILLY TRAYNOR&mdash;POET, PEDLAR, AND PHYSICIAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Didn't I tell you how it would be?" said Billy, as he re-entered the
      kitchen, now crowded by the workpeople, anxious for tidings of the sick
      man. "The head is re-leaved, the congestive symptoms is allayed, and when
      the artarial excitement subsides, he 'll be out of danger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Musha, but I 'm glad," muttered one; "he 'd be a great loss to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True for you, Patsey; there's eight or nine of us here would miss him if
      he was gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Troth, he doesn't give much employment, but we couldn't spare him,"
      croaked out a third, when the entrance of the Corporal cut short further
      commentary; and the party gathered around the cheerful turf fire with that
      instinctive sense of comfort impressed by the swooping wind and rain that
      beat against the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a dreadful night outside; I would n't like to cross the lough in
      it," said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then that's just what I'm thinking of this minit," said Billy. "I'll have
      to be up at the office for the bags at six o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix, you 'll not see Leenane at six o'clock to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorra taste of it," muttered another; "there's a sea runnin' outside now
      that would swamp a life-boat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll not lose an illigant situation of six pounds ten a year, and a pair
      of shoes at Christmas, for want of a bit of courage," said Billy; "I'd
      have my dismissal if I wasn't there as sure as my name is Billy Traynor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And better for you than lose your life, Billy," said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it's not alone myself I'd be thinking of," said Billy; "but every man
      in this world, high and low, has his duties. <i>My</i> duty," added he,
      somewhat pretentiously, "is to carry the King's mail; and if anything was
      to obstruckt, or impade, or delay the correspondience, it's on me the
      blame would lie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The letters wouldn't go the faster because you were drowned," broke in
      the Corporal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," said Billy, rather staggered by the grin of approval that met
      this remark&mdash;"no, sir, what you ob-sarve is true; but nobody reflects
      on the sintry that dies at his post."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you must and will go, I'll give you the yawl," said Craggs; "and I 'll
      go with you myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spoke like a British Grenadier," cried Billy, with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Carbineer, if the same to you, master," said the other, quietly; "I never
      served in the infantry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Tros Tyriusve mihi</i>," cried Billy; "which is as much as to say,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "'To storm the skies, or lay siege to the moon,
     Give me one of the line, or a heavy dragoon,'
</pre>
    <p>
      it's the same to me, as the poet says."
    </p>
    <p>
      And a low murmur of the company seemed to accord approval to the
      sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you 'd give us a tune, Billy," said one, coaxingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or a song would be better," observed another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix," cried a third, "'tis himself could do it, and in Frinch or Latin
      if ye wanted it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Germans was the best I ever knew for music," broke in Craggs. "I was
      brigaded with Arentschild's Hanoverians in Spain; and they used to sit
      outside the tents every evening, and sing. By Jove! how they did sing&mdash;all
      together, like the swell of a church organ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you're right," said Billy, but evidently yielding an unwilling
      assent to this doctrine. "The Germans has a fine national music, and they
      're great for harmony. But harmony and melody is two different things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And which is best, Billy?" asked one of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Musha, but I pity your ignorance," said Billy, with a degree of confusion
      that raised a hearty laugh at his expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, but where's the song?" exclaimed another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," said Craggs, "we are forgetting the song. Now for it, Billy. Since
      all is going on so well above stairs, I'll draw you a gallon of ale, boys,
      and we 'll drink to the master's speedy recovery."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a rare occasion when the Corporal suffered himself to expand in
      this fashion, and great was the applause at the unexpected munificence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy at the same moment took out his fiddle and began that process of
      preparatory screwing and scraping which, no matter how distressing to the
      surrounders, seems to afford intense delight to performers on this
      instrument. In the present case, it is but fair to say, there was neither
      comment nor impatience; on the contrary, they seemed to accept these
      convulsive throes of sound as an earnest of the grand flood of melody that
      was coming. That Billy was occupied with other thoughts than those of
      tuning was, however, apparent, for his lips continued to move rapidly; and
      at moments he was seen to beat time with his foot, as though measuring out
      the rhythm of a verse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have it now, ladies and gentlemen," he said, making a low obeisance to
      the company; and so saying, he struck up a very popular tune, the same to
      which a reverend divine wrote his words of "The night before Larry was
      Stretched;" and in a voice of a deep and mellow fulness, managed with
      considerable taste, sang&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "'A fig for the chansons of France,
        Whose meaning is always a riddle;
     The music to sing or to dance
        Is an Irish tune played on the fiddle.

        I 'm ready to cry out  I am satis;
     Just give us something of our own

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "'What care I for sorrows of those
        Who speak of their heart as a cuore;

        With music whose strains I 'd remember,

</pre>
    <p>
      It is very unlikely that the reader will estimate Billy's impromptu as did
      the company; in fact, it possessed the greatest of all claims to their
      admiration, for it was partly incomprehensible, and by the artful
      introduction of a word here and there, of which his hearers knew nothing,
      the poet was well aware that he was securing their heartiest approval. Nor
      was Billy insensible to such flatteries. The <i>irritabile genus</i> has
      its soft side, and can enjoy to the uttermost its own successes. It is
      possible, if Billy had been in another sphere, with much higher gifts, and
      surrounded by higher associates, that he might have accepted the homage
      tendered him with more graceful modesty, and seemed at least less
      confident of his own merits; but under no possible change of places or
      people could the praise have bestowed more sincere pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're right, there, Jim Morris," said he, turning suddenly round towards
      one of the company; "you never said a truer thing than that. The poetic
      temperament is riches to a poor man. Wherever I go&mdash;in all weathers,
      wet and dreary, and maybe footsore, with the bags full, and the mountain
      streams all flowin' over&mdash;I can just go into my own mind, just the
      way you'd go into an inn, and order whatever you wanted. I don't need to
      be a king, to sit on a throne; I don't want ships, nor coaches, nor
      horses, to convay me to foreign lands. I can bestow kingdoms. When I
      haven't tuppence to buy tobacco, and without a shoe to my foot, and my
      hair through my hat, I can be dancin' wid princesses, and handin'
      empresses in to tay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Musha, musha!" muttered the surrounders, as though they were listening to
      a magician, who in a moment of unguarded familiarity condescended to
      discuss his own miraculous gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And," resumed Billy, "it isn't only what ye are to yourself and your own
      heart, but what ye are to others, that without that sacret bond between
      you, wouldn't think of you at all. I remember, once on a time, I was in
      the north of England travelling, partly for pleasure, and partly with a
      view to a small speculation in Sheffield ware&mdash;cheap penknives and
      scissors, pencil-cases, bodkins, and the like&mdash;and I wandered about
      for weeks through what they call the Lake Country, a very handsome place,
      but nowise grand or sublime, like what we have here in Ireland&mdash;more
      wood, forest timber, and better-off people, but nothing beyond that!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, one evening&mdash;it was in August&mdash;I came down by a narrow
      path to the side of a lake, where there was a stone seat, put up to see
      the view from, and in front was three wooden steps of stairs going down
      into the water, where a boat might come in. It was a lovely spot, and well
      chosen, for you could count as many as five promontories running out into
      the lake; and there was two islands, all wooded to the water's edge; and
      behind all, in the distance, was a great mountain, with clouds on the top;
      and it was just the season when the trees is beginnin' to change their
      colors, and there was shades of deep gold, and dark olive, and russet
      brown, all mingling together with the green, and glowing in the lake below
      under the setting sun, and all was quiet and still as midnight; and over
      the water the only ripple was the track of a water-hen, as she scudded
      past between the islands; and if ever there was peace and tranquillity in
      the world it was just there! Well, I put down my pack in the leaves, for I
      did n't like to see or think of it, and I stretched myself down at the
      water's edge, and I fell into a fit of musing. It's often and often I
      tried to remember the elegant fancies that came through my head, and the
      beautiful things that I thought I saw that night out on the lake fornint
      me! Ye see I was fresh and fastin'; I never tasted a bit the whole day,
      and my brain, maybe, was all the better; for somehow janius, real janius,
      thrives best on a little starvation. And from musing I fell off asleep;
      and it was the sound of voices near that first awoke me! For a minute or
      two I believed I was dreaming, the words came so softly to my ear, for
      they were spoken in a low, gentle voice, and blended in with the slight
      splash of oars that moved through the water carefully, as though not to
      lose a word of him that was speakin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's clean beyond <i>me</i> to tell you what he said; and, maybe, if I
      could, ye would n't be able to follow it, for he was discoorsin' about
      night and the moon, and all that various poets said about them; ye'd think
      that he had books, and was reading out of them, so glibly came the verses
      from his lips. I never listened to such a voice before, so soft, so sweet,
      so musical, and the words came droppin' down, like the clear water
      filterin' over a rocky ledge, and glitterin' like little spangles over
      moss and wild-flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wasn't only in English but Scotch ballads, too, and once or twice in
      Italian that he recited, till at last he gave out, in all the fulness of
      his liquid voice, them elegant lines out of Pope's Homer:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "'As when the moon, refulgent lamp of night,
     O'er heaven's clear azure spreads her sacred light,
     When not a breath disturbs the deep serene,
     And not a cloud o'ercasts the solemn scene,
     Around her throne the vivid planets roll,
     And stars unnumbered gild the glowing pole:
     O'er the dark trees a yellower verdure shed,
     And top with silver every mountain's head;
     Then shine the vales; the rocks in prospect rise&mdash;
     A flood of glory bursts from all the skies;
     The conscious swains, rejoicing in the sight,
     Eye the blue vault and bless the useful light.'
</pre>
    <p>
      "The Lord forgive me, but when he came to the last words and said, 'useful
      light,' I couldn't restrain myself, but broke out, 'That's mighty like a
      bull, anyhow, and reminds me of the ould song,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "'Good luck to the moon, she's a fine noble creature,
     And gives us the daylight all night in the dark.'
</pre>
    <p>
      "Before I knew where I was, the boat glided in to the steps, and a tall
      man, a little stooped in the shoulders, stood before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Is it you,' said he, with a quiet laugh, 'that accuses Pope of a bull?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It is,' says I; 'and, what's more, there isn't a poet from Horace
      downwards that I won't show bulls in; there's bulls in Shakspeare and in
      Milton; there's bulls in the ancients; I 'll point out a bull in
      Aristophanes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What have we here?' said he, turning to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'A poor crayture,' says I, 'like Goldsmith's chest of drawers,&mdash;

    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, with that he took a fit of laughing, and handing the rest out of
      the boat, he made me come along at his side, discoorsin' me about my
      thravels, and all I seen, and all I read, till we reached an elegant
      little cottage on a bank right over the lake; and then he brought me in
      and made me take tay with the family; and I spent the night there; and
      when I started the next morning there was n't a 'screed' of my pack that
      they did n't buy, penknives, and whistles, and nut-crackers, and all,
      just, as they said, for keepsakes. Good luck to them, and happy hearts,
      wherever they are, for they made mine happy that day; ay, and for many an
      hour afterwards, when I just think over their kind words and pleasant
      faces."

    <p>
      More than one of the company had dropped off asleep during Billy's
      narrative, and of the others, their complaisance as listeners appeared
      taxed to the utmost, while the Corporal snored loudly, like a man who had
      a right to indulge himself to the fullest extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's the bell again," muttered one, "that's from the 'lord's room;'"
      and Craggs, starting up by the instinct of his office, hastened off to his
      master's chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord says you are to remain here," said he, as he re-entered a few
      minutes later; "he is satisfied with your skill, and I'm to send off a
      messenger to the post, to let them know he has detained you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm obaydient," said Billy, with a low bow; "and now for a brief
      repose!" And so saying, he drew a long woollen nightcap from his pocket,
      and putting it over his eyes, resigned himself to sleep with the practised
      air of one who needed but very little preparation to secure slumber.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. A VISITOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      The old Castle of Glencore contained but one spacious room, and this
      served all the purposes of drawing-room, dining-room, and library. It was
      a long and lofty chamber, with a raftered ceiling, from which a heavy
      chandelier hung by a massive chain of iron. Six windows, all in the same
      wall, deeply set and narrow, admitted a sparing light. In the opposite
      wall stood two fireplaces, large, massive, and monumental, the carved
      supporters of the richly-chased pediment being of colossal size, and the
      great shield of the house crowning the pyramid of strange and uncouth
      objects that were grouped below. The walls were partly occupied by
      bookshelves, partly covered by wainscot, and here and there displayed a
      worn-out portrait of some bygone warrior or dame, who little dreamed how
      much the color of their effigies should be indebted to the sad effects of
      damp and mildew. The furniture consisted of every imaginable type, from
      the carved oak and ebony console to the white and gold of Versailles
      taste, and the modern compromise of comfort with ugliness which chintz and
      soft cushions accomplish. Two great screens, thickly covered with prints
      and drawings, most of them political caricatures of some fifty years back,
      flanked each fireplace, making, as it were, in this case two different
      apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one of those, on a low sofa, sat, or rather lay, Lord Glencore, pale
      and wasted by long illness. His thin hand held a letter, to shade his eyes
      from the blazing wood-fire, and the other hand hung listlessly at his
      side. The expression of the sick man's face was that of deep melancholy&mdash;not
      the mere gloom of recent suffering, but the deep-cut traces of a
      long-carried affliction, a sorrow which had eaten into his very heart, and
      made its home there.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the second fireplace sat his son, and, though a mere boy, the
      lineaments of his father marked the youth's face with a painful exactness.
      The same intensity was in the eyes, the same haughty character sat on the
      brow; and there was in the whole countenance the most extraordinary
      counterpart of the gloomy seriousness of the older face. He had been
      reading, but the fast-falling night obliged him to desist, and he sat now
      contemplating the bright embers of the wood fire in dreamy thought. Once
      or twice was he disturbed from his revery by the whispered voice of an old
      serving-man, asking for something with that submissive manner assumed by
      those who are continually exposed to the outbreaks of another's temper;
      and at last the boy, who had hitherto scarcely deigned to notice the
      appeals to him, flung a bunch of keys contemptuously on the ground, with a
      muttered malediction on his tormentor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" cried out the sick man, startled at the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis nothing, my lord, but the keys that fell out of my hand," replied
      the old man, humbly. "Mr. Craggs is away to Leenane, and I was going to
      get out the wine for dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's Mr. Charles?" asked Lord Glencore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's there beyant," muttered the other, in a low voice, while he pointed
      towards the distant fireplace; "but he looks tired and weary, and I did
      n't like to disturb him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tired! weary!&mdash;with what? Where has he been; what has he been
      doing?" cried he, hastily. "Charles, Charles, I say!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And slowly rising from his seat, and with an air of languid indifference,
      the boy came towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glencore's face darkened as he gazed on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where have you been?" asked he, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yonder," said the boy, in an accent like the echo of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's Mr. Craggs, now, my lord," said the old butler, as he looked out
      of the window, and eagerly seized the opportunity to interrupt the scene;
      "there he is, and a gentleman with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! go and meet him, Charles,&mdash;it's Harcourt. Go and receive him,
      show him his room, and then bring him here to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy heard without a word, and left the room with the same slow step
      and the same look of apathy. Just as he reached the hall the stranger was
      entering it. He was a tall, well-built man, with the mingled ease and
      stiffness of a soldier in his bearing; his face was handsome, but somewhat
      stern, and his voice had that tone which implies the long habit of
      command.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a Massy, that I'll swear to," said he, frankly, as he shook the
      boy's hand; "the family face in every lineament. And how is your father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better; he has had a severe illness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So his letter told me. I was up the Rhine when I received it, and started
      at once for Ireland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has been very impatient for your coming," said the boy; "he has talked
      of nothing else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, we are old friends. Glencore and I have been schoolfellows, chums at
      college, and messmates in the same regiment," said he, with a slight touch
      of sorrow in his tone. "Will he be able to see me now? Is he confined to
      bed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he will dine with you. I 'm to show you your room, and then bring you
      to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That 's better news than I hoped for, boy. By the way, what's your name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charles Conyngham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure, Charles; how could I have forgotten it! So, Charles, this is
      to be my quarters; and a glorious view there is from this window. What's
      the mountain yonder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ben Creggan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must climb that summit some of these days, Charley. I hope you 're a
      good walker. You shall be my guide through this wild region here, for I
      have a passion for explorings."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he talked away rapidly, while he made a brief toilet, and refreshed
      himself from the fatigues of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Charley, I am at your orders; let us descend to the drawing-room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 'll find my father there," said the boy, as he stopped short at the
      door; and Harcourt, staring at him for a second or two in silence, turned
      the handle and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glencore never turned his head as the other drew nigh, but sat with
      his forehead resting on the table, extending his hand only in welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My poor fellow!" said Harcourt, grasping the thin and wasted fingers,&mdash;"my
      poor fellow, how glad I am to be with you again!" And he seated himself at
      his side as he spoke. "You had a relapse after you wrote to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore slowly raised his head, and, pushing back a small velvet
      skull-cap that he wore, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 'd not have known me, George. Eh? see how gray I am! I saw myself in
      the glass to-day for the first time, and I really could n't believe my
      eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In another week the change will be just as great the other way. It was
      some kind of a fever, was it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe so," said the other, sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And they bled you and blistered you, of course. These fellows are like
      the farriers&mdash;they have but the one system for everything. Who was
      your torturer; where did you get him from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A practitioner of the neighborhood, the wild growth of the mountain,"
      said Glencore, with a sickly smile; "but I must n't be ungrateful; he
      saved my life, if that be a cause for gratitude."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a right good one, I take it. How like you that boy is, Glencore! I
      started back when he met me. It was just as if I was transported again to
      old school-days, and had seen yourself as you used to be long ago. Do you
      remember the long meadow, Glencore?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harcourt," said he, falteringly, "don't talk to me of long ago,&mdash;at
      least not now;" and then, as if thinking aloud, added, "How strange that a
      man without a hope should like the future better than the past!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How old is Charley?" asked Harcourt, anxious to engage him on some other
      theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He 'll be fifteen, I think, his next birthday; he seems older, does n't
      he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, the boy is well grown and athletic. What has he been doing&mdash;have
      you had him at a school?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At a school!" said Glencore, starting; "no, he has lived always here with
      myself. I have been his tutor; I read with him every day, till that
      illness seized me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He looks clever; is he so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like the rest of us, George, he may learn, but he can't be taught. The
      old obstinacy of the race is strong in him, and to rouse him to rebel all
      you have to do is to give him a task; but his faculties are good, his
      apprehension quick, and his memory, if he would but tax it, excellent.
      Here 's Craggs come to tell us of dinner; give me your arm, George, we
      haven't far to go&mdash;this one room serves us for everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're better lodged than I expected&mdash;your letters told me to look
      for a mere barrack; and the place stands so well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, the spot was well chosen, although I suppose its founders cared
      little enough about the picturesque."
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner-table was spread behind one of the massive screens, and, under
      the careful direction of Craggs and old Simon, was well and amply
      supplied,&mdash;fish and game, the delicacies of other localities, being
      here in abundance. Har-court had a traveller's appetite, and enjoyed
      himself thoroughly, while Glencore never touched a morsel, and the boy ate
      sparingly, watching the stranger with that intense curiosity which comes
      of living estranged from all society.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charley will treat you to a bottle of Burgundy, Har-court," said
      Glencore, as they drew round the fire; "he keeps the cellar key."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us have two, Charley," said Harcourt, as the boy arose to leave the
      room, "and take care that you carry them steadily."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy stood for a second and looked at his father, as if interrogating,
      and then a sudden flush suffused his face as Glencore made a gesture with
      his hand for him to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't perceive how you touched him to the quick there, Harcourt? You
      talked to him as to how he should carry the wine; he thought that office
      menial and beneath him, and he looked at me to know what he should do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a fool you have made of the boy!" said Harcourt, bluntly. "By Jove!
      it was time I should come here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      When the boy came back he was followed by the old butler, carefully
      carrying in a small wicker contrivance, <i>Hibernicè</i> called a cooper,
      three cobwebbed and well-crusted bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Charley," said Jarcourt, gayly, "if you want to see a man thoroughly
      happy, just step up to my room and fetch me a small leather sack you 'll
      find there of tobacco, and on the dressing-table you 'll see my meerschaum
      pipe; be cautious with it, for it belonged to no less a man than
      Poniatowski, the poor fellow who died at Leipsic."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad stood again irresolute and confused, when a signal from his father
      motioned him away to acquit the errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Harcourt, as he re-entered; "you see I am not vain of my
      meerschaum without reason. The carving of that bull is a work of real art;
      and if you were a connoisseur in such matters, you 'd say the color was
      perfect. Have you given up smoking, Glencore?&mdash;you used to be fond of
      a weed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I care but little for it," said Glencore, sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take to it again, my dear fellow, if only that it is a bond 'tween
      yourself and every one who whiffs his cloud. There are wonderfully few
      habits&mdash;I was going to say enjoyments, and I might say so, but I 'll
      call them habits&mdash;that consort so well with every condition and every
      circumstance of life, that become the prince and the peasant, suit the
      garden of the palace and the red watch-fire of the bivouac, relieve the
      weary hours of a calm at sea, or refresh the tired hunter in the
      prairies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must tell Charley some of your adventures in the West.&mdash;The
      Colonel has passed two years in the Rocky Mountains," said Glencore to his
      son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, Charley, I have knocked about the world as much as most men, and
      seen, too, my share of its wonders. If accidents by sea and land can
      interest you, if you care for stories of Indian life and the wild habits
      of a prairie hunter, I 'm your man. Your father can tell you more of <i>salons</i>
      and the great world, of what may be termed the high game of life&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have forgotten it, as much as if I had never seen it," said Glencore,
      interrupting, and with a severity of voice that showed the theme
      displeased him. And now a pause ensued, painful perhaps to the others, but
      scarcely felt by Harcourt, as he smoked away peacefully, and seemed lost
      in the windings of his own fancies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you shooting here, Glencore?" asked he at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There might be, if I were to preserve the game."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you do not. Do you fish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; never."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You give yourself up to farming, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not even that; the truth is, Harcourt, I literally do nothing. A few
      newspapers, a stray review or so, reach me in these solitudes, and keep me
      in a measure informed as to the course of events; but Charley and I con
      over our classics together, and scrawl sheets of paper with algebraic
      signs, and puzzle our heads over strange formulas, wonderfully indifferent
      to what the world is doing at the other side of this little estuary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You of all men living to lead such a life as this! a fellow that never
      could cram occupation enough into his short twenty-four hours," broke in
      Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore's pale cheek flushed slightly, and an impatient movement of his
      fingers on the table showed how ill he relished any allusion to his own
      former life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charley will show you to-morrow all the wonders of our erudition.
      Harcourt," said he, changing the subject; "we have got to think ourselves
      very learned, and I hope you 'll be polite enough not to undeceive us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 'll have a merciful critic, Charley," said the Colonel, laughing,
      "for more reasons than one. Had the question been how to track a wolf or
      wind an antelope, to outmanoeuvre a scout party or harpoon a calf-whale,
      I'd not yield to many; but if you throw me amongst Greek roots or double
      equations, I 'm only Samson with his hair <i>en crop!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      The solemn clock over the mantelpiece struck ten, and the boy arose as it
      ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's Charley's bedtime," said Glencore, "and we are determined to make
      no stranger of you, George. He 'll say good-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a manner of mingled shyness and pride the boy held out his hand,
      which the soldier shook cordially, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow, then, Charley, I count upon you for my day, and so that it be
      not to be passed in the library I 'll acquit myself creditably."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like your boy, Glencore," said he, as soon as they were alone. "Of
      course I have seen very little of him; and if I had seen more I should be
      but a sorry judge of what people would call his abilities. But he is a
      good stamp: 'Gentleman' is written on him in a hand that any can read;
      and, by Jove! let them talk as they will, but that's half the battle of
      life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is a strange fellow; you'll not understand him in a moment," said
      Glencore, smiling half sadly to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not understand him, Glencore? I read him like print, man. You think that
      his shy, bashful manner imposes upon me; not a bit of it; I see the fellow
      is as proud as Lucifer. All your solitude and estrangement from the world
      have n't driven out of his head that he's to be a Viscount one of these
      days; and somehow, wherever he has picked it up, he has got a very pretty
      notion of the importance and rank that same title confers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us not speak of this now, Harcourt; I'm far too weak to enter upon
      what it would lead to. It is, however, the great reason for which I
      entreated you to come here. And to-morrow&mdash;at all events in a day or
      two&mdash;we can speak of it fully. And now I must leave you. You 'll have
      to rough it here, George; but as there is no man can do so with a better
      grace, I can spare my apologies; only, I beg, don't let the place be worse
      than it need be. Give your orders; get what you can; and see if your tact
      and knowledge of life cannot remedy many a difficulty which our ignorance
      or apathy have served to perpetuate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll take the command of the garrison with pleasure," said Harcourt,
      filling up his glass, and replenishing the fire. "And now a good night's
      rest to you, for I half suspect I have already jeopardied some of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old campaigner sat till long past midnight. The generous wine, his
      pipe, the cheerful wood-fire, were all companionable enough, and well
      suited thoughts which took no high or heroic range, but were chiefly
      reveries of the past,&mdash;some sad, some pleasant, but all tinged with
      the one philosophy, which made him regard the world as a campaign, wherein
      he who grumbles or repines is but a sorry soldier, and unworthy of his
      cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till the last glass was drained that he arose to seek his bed,
      and presently humming some old air to himself, he slowly mounted the
      stairs to his chamber.

      CHAPTER V. COLONEL HARCOUUT'S LETTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      As we desire throughout this tale to make the actors themselves, wherever
      it be possible, the narrators, using their words in preference to our own,
      we shall now place before the reader a letter written by Colonel Harcourt
      about a week after his arrival at Glencore, which will at least serve to
      rescue him and ourselves from the task of repetition.

      It was addressed to Sir Horace Upton, Her Majesty's Envoy at Stuttgard,
      one who had formerly served in the same regiment with Glencore and
      himself, but who left the army early to follow the career of diplomacy,
      wherein, still a young man, he had risen to the rank of a minister. It is
      not important, at this moment, to speak more particularly of his
      character, than that it was in almost every respect the opposite of his
      correspondent's. Where the one was frank, open, and unguarded, the other
      was cold, cautious, and reserved; where one believed, the other doubted;
      where one was hopeful, the other had nothing but misgivings. Harcourt
      would have twenty times a day wounded the feelings, or jarred against the
      susceptibility, of his best friend; Upton could not be brought to trench
      upon the slightest prejudice of his greatest enemy. We might continue this
      contrast to every detail of their characters; but enough has now been
      said, and we proceed to the letter in question:
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore Castle. Dear Upton,&mdash;True to my promise to give you early
      tidings of our old friend, I sit down to pen a few lines, which if a
      rickety table and some infernal lampblack for ink should make illegible,
      you 'll have to wait for the elucidation till my arrival. I found Glencore
      terribly altered; I 'd not have known him. He used to be muscular and
      rather full in habit; he is now a mere skeleton. His hair and mustache
      were coal black; they are a motley gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was straight as an arrow&mdash;pretentiously erect, many thought; he is
      stooped now, and bent nearly double. His voice, too, the most clear and
      ringing in the squadron, is become a hoarse whisper. You remember what a
      passion he had for dress, and how heartily we all deplored the chance of
      his being colonel, well knowing what precious caprices of costly costume
      would be the consequence; well, a discharged corporal in a cast-off mufti
      is stylish compared to him. I don't think he has a hat&mdash;I have only
      seen an oilskin cap; but his coat, his one coat, is a curiosity of
      industrious patchwork; and his trousers are a pair of our old overalls,
      the same pattern we wore at Hounslow when the King reviewed us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great as these changes are, they are nothing to the alteration in the poor
      fellow's disposition. He that was generous to munificence is now an
      absolute miser, descending to the most pitiful economy and moaning over
      every trifling outlay. He is irritable, too, to a degree. Far from the
      jolly, light-hearted comrade, ready to join in the laugh against himself,
      and enjoy a jest of which he was the object, he suspects a slight in every
      allusion, and bristles up to resent a mere familiarity as though it were
      an insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I put much of this down to the score of illness, and of bad
      health before he was so ill; but, depend upon it, he's not the man we knew
      him. Heaven knows if he ever will be so again. The night I arrived here he
      was more natural, more like himself, in fact, than he has ever been since.
      His manner was heartier, and in his welcome there was a touch of the old
      jovial good fellow, who never was so happy as when sharing his quarters
      with a comrade. Since that he has grown punctilious, anxiously asking me
      if I am comfortable, and teasing me with apologies for what I don't miss,
      and excuses about things that I should never have discovered wanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I see what is passing within him; he wants to be confidential, and
      he does n't know how to go about it. I suppose he looks on me as rather a
      rough father to confess to; he is n't quite sure what kind of sympathy, if
      any, he 'll meet with from me, and he more than half dreads a certain
      careless, outspoken way in which I have now and then addressed his boy, of
      whom more anon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may be right, or I may be wrong, in this conjecture; but certain it is,
      that nothing like confidential conversation has yet passed between us, and
      each day seems to render the prospect of such only less and less likely. I
      wish from my heart you were here; you are just the fellow to suit him,&mdash;just
      calculated to nourish the susceptibilities that <i>I</i> only shock. I
      said as much t' other day, in a half-careless way, and he immediately
      caught it up, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, George, Upton is a man one wants now and then in life, and when the
      moment comes, there is no such thing as a substitute for him." In a joking
      manner, I then remarked, "Why not come over to see him?" "Leave this!"
      cried he; "venture in the world again; expose myself to its brutal
      insolence, or still more brutal pity!" In a torrent of passion, he went on
      in this strain, till I heartily regretted that I had ever touched this
      unlucky topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      I date his greatest reserve from that same moment; and I am sure he is
      disposed to connect me with the casual suggestion to go over to Stuttgard,
      and deems me, in consequence, one utterly deficient in all true feeling
      and delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I need n't tell you that my stay here is the reverse of a pleasure. I 'm
      never what fine people call bored anywhere; and I could amuse myself
      gloriously in this queer spot. I have shot some half-dozen seals, hooked
      the heaviest salmon I ever saw rise to a fly, and have had rare coursing,&mdash;not
      to say that Glencore's table, with certain reforms I have introduced, is
      very tolerable, and his cellar unimpeachable. I'll back his chambertin
      against your Excellency's, and I have discovered a bin of red hermitage
      that would convert a whole vineyard of the smallest Lafitte into Sneyd's
      claret; but with all these seductions, I can't stand the life of continued
      restraint I 'm reduced to. Glencore evidently sent for me to make some
      revelations, which, now that he sees me, he cannot accomplish. For aught I
      know, there may be as many changes in <i>me</i> to <i>his</i> eyes as to
      <i>mine</i> there are in <i>him</i>. I only can vouch for it, that if I
      ride three stone heavier, I have n't the worse place, and I don't detect
      any striking falling off in my appreciation of good fare and good fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spoke of the boy; he is a fine lad,&mdash;somewhat haughty, perhaps; a
      little spoiled by the country people calling him the young lord; but a
      generous fellow, and very like Glencore when he first joined us at
      Canterbury. By way of educating him himself, Glencore has been driving
      Virgil and decimal fractions into him; and the boy, bred in the country,&mdash;never
      out of it for a day,&mdash;can't load a gun or tie a hackle. Not the worst
      thing about the lad is his inordinate love for Glencore, whom he imagines
      to be about the greatest and most gifted being that ever lived. I can
      scarcely help smiling at the implicitness of this honest faith; but I take
      good care not to smile; on the contrary, I give every possible
      encouragement to the belief. I conclude the disenchantment will arrive
      only too early at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      You 'll not know what to make of such a lengthy epistle from me, and you
      'll doubtless torture that fine diplomatic intelligence of yours to detect
      the secret motive of my long-windedness; but the simple fact is, it has
      rained incessantly for the last three days, and promises the same cheering
      weather for as many more. Glencore doesn't fancy that the boy's lessons
      should be broken in upon, and <i>hinc istæ litteræ</i>,&mdash;that's
      classical for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish I could say when I am likely to beat my retreat. I 'd stay&mdash;not
      very willingly, perhaps, but still I 'd stay&mdash;if I thought myself of
      any use; but I cannot persuade myself that I am such. Glencore is now
      about again, feeble of course, and much pulled down, but able to go about
      the house and the garden. I can contribute nothing to his recovery, and I
      fear as little to his comfort. I even doubt if he desires me to prolong my
      visit; but such is my fear of offending him, that I actually dread to
      allude to my departure, till I can sound my way as to how he 'll take it.
      This fact alone will show you how much he is changed from the Glencore of
      long ago. Another feature in him, totally unlike his former self, struck
      me the other evening. We were talking of old messmates&mdash;Croydon,
      Stanhope, Loftus, and yourself&mdash;and instead of dwelling, as he once
      would have done, exclusively on your traits of character and disposition,
      he discussed nothing but your abilities, and the capacity by which you
      could win your way to honors and distinction. I need n't say how, in such
      a valuation, you came off best. Indeed, he professes the highest esteem
      for your talents, and says, "You'll see Upton either a cabinet minister or
      ambassador at Paris yet;" and this he repeated in the same words last
      night, as if to show it was not dropped as a mere random observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have some scruples about venturing to offer anything bordering on a
      suggestion to a great and wily diplomatist like yourself; but if an
      illustrious framer of treaties and protocols would condescend to take a
      hint from an old dragoon colonel, I 'd say that a few lines from your
      crafty pen might possibly unlock this poor fellow's heart, and lead him to
      unburthen to <i>you</i> what he evidently cannot persuade himself to
      reveal to me. I can see plainly enough that there is something on his
      mind; but I know it just as a stupid old hound feels there is a fox in the
      cover, but cannot for the life of him see how he's to "draw" him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A letter from you would do him good, at all events; even the little gossip
      of your gossiping career would cheer and amuse him. He said very
      plaintively, two nights ago, "They 've all forgotten me. When a man
      retires from the world he begins to die, and the great event, after all,
      is only the <i>coup de grace</i> to a long agony of torture." Do write to
      him, then; the address is "Glencore Castle, Leenane, Ireland," where, I
      suppose, I shall be still a resident for another fortnight to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore has just sent for me; but I must close this for the post, or it
      will be too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours ever truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      George Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      I open this to say that he sent for me to ask your address,&mdash;whether
      through the Foreign Office, or direct to Stuttgard. You 'll probably not
      hear for some days, for he writes with extreme difficulty, and I leave it
      to your wise discretion to write to him or not in the interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor fellow, he looks very ill to-day. He says that he never slept the
      whole night, and that the laudanum he took to induce drowsiness only
      excited and maddened him. I counselled a hot jorum of mulled porter before
      getting into bed; but he deemed me a monster for the recommendation, and
      seemed quite disgusted besides. Could n't you send him over a despatch? I
      think such a document from Stuttgard ought to be an unfailing soporific.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. QUEER COMPANIONSHIP
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Harcourt repaired to Glencore's bedroom, where he still lay, wearied
      and feverish after a bad night, he was struck by the signs of suffering in
      the sick man's face. The cheeks were bloodless and fallen iq, the lips
      pinched, and in the eyes there shone that unnatural brilliancy which
      results from an over-wrought and over-excited brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down here, George," said he, pointing to a chair beside the bed; "I
      want to talk to you. I thought every day that I could muster courage for
      what I wish to say; but somehow, when the time arrived, I felt like a
      criminal who entreats for a few hours more of life, even though it be a
      life of misery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It strikes me that you were never less equal to the effort than now,"
      said Harcourt, laying his hand on the other's pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't believe my pulse, George," said Glencore, smiling faintly. "The
      machine may work badly, but it has wonderful holding out. I 've gone
      through enough," added he, gloomily, "to kill most men, and here I am
      still, breathing and suffering."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This place doesn't suit you, Glencore. There are not above two days in
      the month you can venture to take the air."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And where would you have me go, sir?" he broke in, fiercely. "Would you
      advise Paris and the Boulevards, or a palace in the Piazza di Spagna at
      Rome; or perhaps the Chiaja at Naples would be public enough? Is it that I
      may parade disgrace and infamy through Europe that I should leave this
      solitude?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to see you in a better climate, Glencore,&mdash;in a place where
      the sun shines occasionally."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This suits me," said the other, bluntly; "and here I have the security
      that none can invade,&mdash;none molest me. But it is not of myself I wish
      to speak,&mdash;it is of my boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harcourt made no reply, but sat patiently to listen to what was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is time to think of him," added Glencore, slowly. "The other day,&mdash;it
      seems but the other day,&mdash;and he was a mere child; a few years more,&mdash;to
      seem when past like a long dreary night,&mdash;and he will be a man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true," said Harcourt; "and Charley is one of those fellows who only
      make one plunge from the boy into all the responsibilities of manhood.
      Throw him into a college at Oxford, or the mess of a regiment to-morrow,
      and this day week you'll not know him from the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore was silent; if he had heard, he never noticed Harcourt's remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he ever spoken to you about himself, Harcourt?" asked he, after a
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, except when I led the subject in that direction; and even then
      reluctantly, as though it were a topic he would avoid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you discovered any strong inclination in him for a particular kind
      of life, or any career in preference to another?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None; and if I were only to credit what I see of him, I 'd say that this
      dull monotony and this dreary uneventful existence is what he likes best
      of all the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You really think so?" cried Glencore, with an eagerness that seemed out
      of proportion to the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So far as I see," rejoined Harcourt, guardedly, and not wishing to let
      his observation carry graver consequences than he might suspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that you deem him capable of passing a life of a quiet, unambitious
      tenor,&mdash;neither seeking for distinctions nor fretting after honors?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How should he know of their existence, Glencore? What has the boy ever
      heard of life and its struggles? It's not in Homer or Sallust he 'd learn
      the strife of parties and public men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why need he ever know them?" broke in Glencore, fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he doesn't know them now, he's sure to be taught them hereafter. A
      young fellow who will succeed to a title and a good fortune&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop, Harcourt!" cried Glencore, passionately. "Has anything of this kind
      ever escaped you in intercourse with the boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a word&mdash;not a syllable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he himself ever, by a hint, or by a chance word, implied that he was
      aware of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore faltered and hesitated, for the word he sought for did not
      present itself. Harcourt, however, released him from all embarrassment by
      saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "With me the boy is rarely anything but a listener; he hears me talk away
      of tiger-shooting and buffalo-hunting, scarcely ever interrupting me with
      a question. But I can see in his manner with the country people, when they
      salute him, and call him 'my lord'&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he is not 'my lord,'" broke in Glencore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course he is not; that I am well aware of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He never will&mdash;never shall be," cried Glencore, in a voice to which
      a long pent-up passion imparted a terrible energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How!&mdash;what do you mean, Glencore?" said Harcourt, eagerly. "Has he
      any malady; is there any deadly taint?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That there is, by Heaven!" cried the sick man, grasping the curtain with
      one hand, while he held the other firmly clenched upon his forehead,&mdash;"a
      taint, the deadliest that can stain a human heart! Talk of station, rank,
      title&mdash;what are they, if they are to be coupled with shame, ignominy,
      and sorrow? The loud voice of the herald calls his father Sixth Viscount
      of Glencore, but a still louder voice proclaims his mother a&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      With a wild burst of hysteric laughter, he threw himself, face downwards,
      on the bed; and now scream after scream burst from him, till the room was
      filled by the servants, in the midst of whom appeared Billy, who had only
      that same day returned from Leenane, whither he had gone to make a formal
      resignation of his functions as letter-carrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is nothing but an <i>accessio nervosa,</i>" said Billy; "clear the
      room, ladies and gentlemen, and lave me with the patient." And Harcourt
      gave the signal for obedience by first taking his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glencore's attack was more serious than at first it was apprehended,
      and for three days there was every threat of a relapse of his late fever;
      but Billy's skill was once more successful, and on the fourth day he
      declared that the danger was past. During this period, Harcourt's
      attention was for the first time drawn to the strange creature who
      officiated as the doctor, and who, in despite of all the detracting
      influences of his humble garb and mean attire, aspired to be treated with
      the deference due to a great physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it's the crown and the sceptre makes the king," said he, "'tis the
      same with the science that makes the doctor; and no man can be despised
      when he has a rag of ould Galen's mantle to cover his shoulders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you're going to take blood from him?" asked Harcourt, as he met him on
      the stairs, where he had awaited his coming one night when it was late.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir; 'tis more a disturbance of the great nervous centres than any
      derangement of the heart and arteries," said Billy, pompously; "that's
      what shows a real doctor,&mdash;to distinguish between the effects of
      excitement and inflammation, which is as different as fireworks is from a
      bombardment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bad simile, Master Billy; come in and drink a glass of
      brandy-and-water with me," said Harcourt, right glad at the prospect of
      such companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy Traynor, too, was flattered by the invitation, and seated himself at
      the fire with an air at once proud and submissive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've a difficult patient to treat there," said Harcourt, when he had
      furnished his companion with a pipe, and twice filled his glass; "he's
      hard to manage, I take it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yer' right," said Billy; "every touch is a blow, every breath of air is a
      hurricane with him. There 's no such thing as traitin' a man of that
      timperament; it's the same with many of them ould families as with our
      racehorses,&mdash;they breed them too fine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Egad! I think you are right," said Harcourt, pleased with an illustration
      that suited his own modes of thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," said Billy, gaining confidence by the approval; "a man is a
      ma-chine, and all the parts ought to be balanced, and, as the ancients
      say, <i>in equilibrio</i>. If preponderance here or there, whether it be
      brain or spinal marrow, cardiac functions or digestive ones, you disthroy
      him, and make that dangerous kind of constitution that, like a horse with
      a hard mouth, or a boat with a weather helm, always runs to one side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's well put, well explained," said Harcourt, who really thought the
      illustration appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, my lord there," continued Billy, "is all out of balance, every bit
      of him. Bleed him, and he sinks; stimulate him, and he goes ragin' mad. 'T
      is their physical conformation makes their character; and to know how to
      cure them in sickness, one ought to have some knowledge of them in
      health."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How came you to know all this? You are a very remarkable fellow, Billy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am, sir; I'm a phenumenon in a small way. And many people thinks, when
      they see and convarse with me, what a pity it is I hav' n't the advantages
      of edication and instruction; and that's just where they 're wrong,&mdash;complately
      wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I confess I don't perceive that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll show you, then. There's a kind of janius natural to men like myself,&mdash;in
      Ireland I mean, for I never heerd of it elsewhere,&mdash;that's just like
      our Irish emerald or Irish diamond,&mdash;wonderful if one considers where
      you find it, astonishin' if you only think how azy it is to get, but a
      regular disappointment, a downright take-in, if you intend to have it cut
      and polished and set. No, sir; with all the care and culture in life, you
      'll never make a precious stone of it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've not taken the right way to convince me, by using such an
      illustration, Billy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll try another, then," said Billy. "We are like Willy-the-Whisps,
      showing plenty of light where there's no road to travel, but of no manner
      of use on the highway, or in the dark streets of a village where one has
      business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your own services here are the refutation to your argument, Billy," said
      Harcourt, filling his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis your kindness to say so, sir," said Billy, with gratified pride;
      "but the sacrat was, he thrusted me,&mdash;that was the whole of it. All
      the miracles of physic is confidence, just as all the magic of eloquence
      is conviction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have reflected profoundly, I see," said Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I made a great many observations at one time of my life,&mdash;the
      opportunity was favorable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When and how was that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I travelled with a baste caravan for two years, sir; and there's nothing
      taches one to know mankind like the study of bastes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not complimentary to humanity, certainly," said Harcourt, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but it is, though; for it is by a consideration of the <i>fero
      naturo</i> that you get at the raal nature of mere animal existence. You
      see there man in the rough, as a body might say, just as he was turned out
      of the first workshop, and before he was infiltrated with the <i>divinus
      afflatus</i>, the ethereal essence, that makes him the first of creation.
      There 's all the qualities, good and bad,&mdash;love, hate, vengeance,
      gratitude, grief, joy, ay, and mirth,&mdash;there they are in the brutes;
      but they 're in no subjection, except by fear. Now, it's out of man's
      motives his character is moulded, and fear is only one amongst them. D' ye
      apprehend me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly; fill your pipe." And he pushed the tobacco towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will; and I 'll drink the memory of the great and good man that first
      intro-duced the weed amongst us&mdash;Here's Sir Walter Raleigh! By the
      same token, I was in his house last week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In his house! where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Down at Greyhall. You Englishmen, savin' your presence, always forget
      that many of your celebrities lived years in Ireland; for it was the same
      long ago as now,&mdash;a place of decent banishment for men of janius, a
      kind of straw-yard where ye turned out your intellectual hunters till the
      sayson came on at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm sorry to see, Billy, that, with all your enlightenment, you have the
      vulgar prejudice against the Saxon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that's the rayson I have it, because it is vulgar," said Billy,
      eagerly. "Vulgar means popular, common to many; and what's the best test
      of truth in anything but universal belief, or whatever comes nearest to
      it? I wish I was in Parliament&mdash;I just wish I was there the first
      night one of the nobs calls out 'That 's vulgar;' and I 'd just say to
      him, 'Is there anything as vulgar as men and women? Show me one good thing
      in life that is n't vulgar! Show me an object a painter copies, or a poet
      describes, that is n't so!' Ayeh," cried he, impatiently, "when they
      wanted a hard word to fling at us, why didn't they take the right one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are unjust, Billy; the ungenerous tone you speak of is fast
      disappearing. Gentlemen nowadays use no disparaging epithets to men poorer
      or less happily circumstanced than themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix," said Billy, "it isn't sitting here at the same table with yourself
      that I ought to gainsay that remark."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Harcourt was so struck by the air of good breeding in which he spoke,
      that he grasped his hand, and shook it warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what is more," continued Billy, "from this day out I 'll never think
      so."
    </p>
    <p>
      He drank off his glass as he spoke, giving to the libation all the
      ceremony of a solemn vow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "D' ye hear that?&mdash;them's oars; there's a boat coming in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have sharp hearing, master," said Harcourt, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I got the gift when I was a smuggler," replied he. "I could put my ear to
      the ground of a still night, and tell you the tramp of a revenue boot as
      well as if I seen it. And now I'll lay sixpence it's Pat Morissy is at the
      bow oar there; he rows with a short jerking stroke there 's no timing.
      That's himself, and it must be something urgent from the post-office that
      brings him over the lough to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were scarcely spoken when Craggs entered with a letter in his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is for you, Colonel," said he; "it was marked 'immediate,' and the
      post-mistress despatched it by an express."
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was a very brief one; but, in honor to the writer, we shall
      give it a chapter to itself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. A GREAT DIPLOMATIST
    </h2>
    <p>
      My dear Harcourt,&mdash;I arrived here yesterday, and by good fortune
      caught your letter at F. O., where it was awaiting the departure of the
      messenger for Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your account of poor Glencore is most distressing. At the same time, my
      knowledge of the man and his temper in a measure prepared me for it. You
      say that he wishes to see me, and intends to write. Now, there is a small
      business matter between us, which his lawyer seems much disposed to push
      on to a difficulty, if not to worse. To prevent this, if possible,&mdash;at
      all events to see whether a visit from me might not be serviceable,&mdash;I
      shall cross over to Ireland on Tuesday, and be with you by Friday, or at
      latest Saturday. Tell him that I am coming, but only for a day. My
      engagements are such that I must be here again early in the following
      week. On Thursday I go down to Windsor.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is wonderfully little stirring here, but I keep that little for our
      meeting. You are aware, my dear friend, what a poor, shattered,
      broken-down fellow I am; so that I need not ask you to give me a
      comfortable quarter for my one night, and some shell-fish, if easily
      procurable, for my one dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours, ever and faithfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      H. U.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already told our reader that the note was a brief one, and yet was
      it not altogether uncharacteristic. Sir Horace Upton&mdash;it will spare
      us both some repetition if we present him at once&mdash;was one of a very
      composite order of human architecture; a kind of being, in fact, of which
      many would deny the existence, till they met and knew them, so full of
      contradictions, real and apparent, was his nature. Chivalrous in sentiment
      and cunning in action, noble in aspiration and utterly sceptical as
      regards motives, one half of his temperament was the antidote to the
      other. Fastidious to a painful extent in matters of taste, he was
      simplicity itself in all the requirements of his life; and with all a
      courtier's love of great people, not only tolerating, but actually
      preferring the society of men beneath him. In person he was tall, and with
      that air of distinction in his manner that belongs only to those who unite
      natural graces with long habits of high society. His features were finely
      formed, and would have been strikingly handsome, were the expression not
      spoiled by a look of astuteness,&mdash;a something that implied a tendency
      to overreach,&mdash;which marred their repose and injured their
      uniformity. Not that his manner ever betrayed this weakness; far from it,&mdash;his
      was a most polished courtesy. It was impossible to conceive an address
      more bland or more conciliating. His very gestures, his voice, languid by
      a slight habit of indisposition, seemed as though exerted above their
      strength in the desire to please, and making the object of his attentions
      to feel himself the mark of peculiar honor. There ran through all his
      nature, through everything he did or said or thought, a certain haughty
      humility, which served, while it assigned an humble place to himself, to
      mark out one still more humble for those about him. There were not many
      things he could not do; indeed, he had actually done most of those which
      win honor and distinction in life. He had achieved a very gallant but
      brief military career in India, made a most brilliant opening in
      Parliament, where his abilities at once marked him out for office, was
      suspected to be the writer of the cleverest political satire, and more
      than suspected to be the author of "the novel" of the day. With all this,
      he had great social success. He was deep enough for a ministerial dinner,
      and "fast" enough for a party of young Guardsmen at Greenwich. With women,
      too, he was especially a favorite; there was a Machiavelian subtlety which
      he could throw into small things, a mode of making the veriest trifles
      little Chinese puzzles of ingenuity, that flattered and amused them. In a
      word, he had great adaptiveness, and it was a quality he indulged less for
      the gratification of others than for the pleasure it afforded himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had mixed largely in society, not only of his own, but of every country
      of Europe. He knew every chord of that complex instrument which people
      call the world, like a master; and although a certain jaded and wearied
      look, a tone of exhaustion and fatigue, seemed to say that he was tired of
      it all, that he had found it barren and worthless, the real truth was, he
      enjoyed life to the full as much as on the first day in which he entered
      it; and for this simple reason,&mdash;that he had started with an humble
      opinion of mankind, their hopes, fears, and ambitions, and so he
      continued, not disappointed, to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most governing notion of his own life was an impression that he had a
      disease of the chest, some subtle and mysterious affection which had
      defied the doctors, and would go on to defy them to the last. He had been
      dangerously wounded in the Burmese war, and attributed the origin of his
      malady to this cause. Others there were who said that the want of
      recognition to his services in that campaign was the direst of all the
      injuries he had received. And true it was, a most brilliant career had met
      with neither honors nor advancement, and Upton left the service in
      disgust, carrying away with him only the lingering sufferings of his
      wound. To suggest to him that his malady had any affinity to any known
      affection was to outrage him, since the mere supposition would reduce him
      to a species of equality with some one else,&mdash;a thought infinitely
      worse than any mere physical suffering; and, indeed, to avoid this
      shocking possibility, he vacillated as to the locality of his disorder,
      making it now in the lung, now in the heart, at one time in the bronchial
      tubes, at another in the valves of the aorta. It was his pleasure to
      consult for this complaint every great physician of Europe, and not alone
      consult, but commit himself to their direction, and this with a credulity
      which he could scarcely have summoned in any other cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult to say how far he himself believed in this disorder,&mdash;the
      pressure of any momentous event, the necessity of action, never finding
      him unequal to any effort, no matter how onerous. Give him a difficulty,&mdash;a
      minister to outwit, a secret scheme to unravel, a false move to profit by,&mdash;and
      he rose above all his pulmonary symptoms, and could exert himself with a
      degree of power and perseverance that very few men could equal, none
      surpass. Indeed it seemed as though he kept this malady for the pastime of
      idle hours, as other men do a novel or a newspaper, but would never permit
      it to interfere with the graver business of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have, perhaps, been prolix in our description; but we have felt it the
      more requisite to be thus diffuse, since the studious simplicity which
      marked all his manner might have deceived our reader, and which the
      impression of his mere words have failed to convey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be glad to hear Upton is in England, Glen-core," said Harcourt,
      as the sick man was assisted to his seat in the library, "and, what is
      more, intends to pay you a visit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upton coming here!" exclaimed Glencore, with an expression of mingled
      astonishment and confusion; "how do you know that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He writes me from Long's to say that he 'll be with us by Friday, or, if
      not, by Saturday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a miserable place to receive him!" exclaimed Glencore. "As for you,
      Harcourt, you know how to rough it, and have bivouacked too often under
      the stars to care much for satin curtains. But think of Upton here! How is
      he to eat, where is he to sleep?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove! we 'll treat him handsomely. Don't you fret yourself about his
      comforts; besides, I 've seen a great deal of Upton, and, with all his
      fastidiousness and refinement, he's a thorough good fellow at taking
      things for the best. Invite him to Chatsworth, and the chances are he'll
      find fault with twenty things,&mdash;with the place, the cookery, and the
      servants; but take him down to the Highlands, lodge him in a shieling,
      with bannocks for breakfast and a Fyne herring for supper, and I 'll wager
      my life you 'll not see a ruffle in his temper, nor hear a word of
      impatience out of his mouth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that he is a well-bred gentleman," said Glencore, half pettishly;
      "but I have no fancy for putting his good manners to a severe test,
      particularly at the cost of my own feelings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you again he shall be admirably treated; he shall have my room;
      and, as for his dinner, Master Billy and I are going to make a raid
      amongst the lobster-pots. And what with turbot, oysters, grouse-pie, and
      mountain mutton, I 'll make the diplomatist sorrow that he is not
      accredited to some native sovereign in the Arran islands, instead of some
      'mere German Hertzog.' He can only stay one day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all; he is over head and ears in business, and he goes down to
      Windsor on Thursday, so that there is no help for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I may be strong enough; I hope to Heaven that I may rally&mdash;"
      Glencore stopped suddenly as he got thus far, but the agitation the words
      cost him seemed most painful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say again, don't distress yourself about Upton,&mdash;leave the care of
      entertaining him to <i>me</i>. I 'll vouch for it that he leaves us well
      satisfied with his welcome."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not of <i>that</i> I was thinking," said he, impatiently; "I have
      much to say to him,&mdash;things of great importance. It may be that I
      shall be unequal to the effort; I cannot answer for my strength for a day,&mdash;not
      for an hour. Could you not write to him, and ask him to defer his coming
      till such time as he can spare me a week, or at least some days?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Glencore, you know the man well, and that we are lucky if we can
      have him on his <i>own</i> terms, not to think of imposing <i>ours</i>; he
      is sure to have a number of engagements while he is in England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, be it so," said Glencore, sighing, with the air of a man resigning
      himself to an inevitable necessity.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. THE GREAT MAN'S ARRIVAL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Not come, Craggs!" said Harcourt, as late on the Saturday evening the
      Corporal stepped on shore, after crossing the lough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, no sign of him. I sent a boy away to the top of 'the Devil's
      Mother,' where you have a view of the road for eight miles, but there was
      nothing to be seen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You left orders at the post-office to have a boat in readiness if he
      arrived?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Colonel," said he, with a military salute; and Harcourt now turned
      moodily towards the Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore had scarcely ever been a very cheery residence, but latterly it
      had become far gloomier than before. Since the night of Lord Glencore's
      sudden illness, there had grown up a degree of constraint between the two
      friends which to a man of Harcourt's disposition was positive torture.
      They seldom met, save at dinner, and then their reserve was painfully
      evident.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy, too, in unconscious imitation of his father, grew more and more
      distant; and poor Harcourt saw himself in that position, of all others the
      most intolerable,&mdash;the unwilling guest of an unwilling host.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come or not come," muttered he to himself, "I 'll bear this no longer.
      There is, besides, no reason why I should bear it. I 'm of no use to the
      poor fellow; he does not want, he never sees me. If anything, my presence
      is irksome to him; so that, happen what will, I 'll start to-morrow, or
      next day at farthest."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was one of those men to whom deliberation on any subject was no small
      labor, but who, once that they have come to a decision, feel as if they
      had acquitted a debt, and need give themselves no further trouble in the
      matter. In the enjoyment of this newly purchased immunity he entered the
      room where Glencore sat impatiently awaiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another disappointment!" said the Viscount, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; Craggs has just returned, and says there's no sign of a carriage for
      miles on the Oughterard road."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to have known it," said the other, in a voice of guttural
      sternness. "He was ever the same; an appointment with him was an
      engagement meant only to be binding on those who expected him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who can say what may have detained him? He was in London on business,&mdash;public
      business, too; and even if he had left town, how many chance delays there
      are in travelling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have said every one of these things over to myself, Harcourt; but they
      don't satisfy me. This is a habit with Upton. I 've seen him do the same
      with his Colonel, when he was a subaltern; I 've heard of his arrival late
      to a Court dinner, and only smiling at the dismay of the horrified
      courtiers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Egad," said Harcourt, bluntly, "I don't see the advantage of the
      practice. One is so certain of doing fifty things in this daily life to
      annoy one's friends, through mere inadvertence or forgetfulness, that I
      think it is but sorry fun to incur their ill-will by malice prepense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is precisely why he does it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, Glencore; old Rixson was right when he said, 'Heaven help the
      man whose merits are canvassed while they wait dinner for him.' I 'll
      order up the soup, for if we wait any longer we 'll discover Upton to be
      the most graceless vagabond that ever walked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know his qualities, good and bad," said Glencore, rising, and pacing
      the room with slow, uncertain steps; "few men know him better. None need
      tell me of his abilities; none need instruct me as to his faults. What
      others do by accident, <i>he</i> does by design. He started in life by
      examining how much the world would bear from him; he has gone on,
      profiting by the experience, and improving on the practice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if I don't mistake me much, he 'll soon appear to plead his own
      cause. I hear oars coming speedily in this direction."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so saying, Harcourt hurried away to resolve his doubts at once. As he
      reached the little jetty, over which a large signal-fire threw a strong
      red light, he perceived that he was correct, and was just in time to grasp
      Upton's hand as he stepped on shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How picturesque all this, Harcourt," said he, in his soft, low voice; "a
      leaf out of 'Rob Roy.' Well, am I not the mirror of punctuality, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We looked for you yesterday, and Glencore has been so impatient."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course he has; it is the vice of your men who do nothing. How is he?
      Does he dine with us? Fritz, take care those leather pillows are properly
      aired, and see that my bath is ready by ten o 'clock. Give me your arm,
      Harcourt; what a blessing it is to be such a strong fellow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is, by Jove! I am always thankful for it. And you&mdash;how do you
      get on? You look well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I?" said he, faintly, and pushing back his hair with an almost
      fine-ladylike affectation. "I 'm glad you say so. It always rallies me a
      little to hear I 'm better. You had my letter about the fish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, and I'll give you such a treat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, my dear Harcourt; a fried mackerel, or a whiting and a few crumbs
      of bread,&mdash;nothing more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you insist, it shall be so; but I promise you I'll not be of your
      mess, that's all. This is a glorious spot for turbot&mdash;and such
      oysters!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oysters are forbidden me, and don't let me have the torture of
      temptation. What a charming place this seems to be!&mdash;very wild, very
      rugged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wild&mdash;rugged! I should think it is," muttered Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This pathway, though, does not bespeak much care. I wish our friend
      yonder would hold his lantern a little lower. How I envy you the kind of
      life you lead here,&mdash;so tranquil, so removed from all bores! By the
      way, you get the newspapers tolerably regularly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, every day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right. If there be a luxury left to any man after the age of
      forty, it is to be let alone. It's the best thing I know of. What a
      terrible bit of road! They might have made a pathway."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, don't grow faint-hearted. Here we are; this is Glencore."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a moment. Just let him raise that lantern. Really this is very
      striking&mdash;a very striking scene altogether. The doorway excellent,
      and that little watch-tower, with its lone-star light, a perfect picture."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 'll have time enough to admire all this; and we are keeping poor
      Glencore waiting," said Harcourt, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true; so we are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glencore's son, Upton," said Harcourt, presenting the boy, who stood,
      half pride, half bashfulness, in the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear boy, you see one of your father's oldest friends in the world,"
      said Upton, throwing one arm on the boy's shoulder, apparently caressing,
      but as much to aid himself in ascending the stair. "I'm charmed with your
      old Schloss here, my dear," said he, as they moved along. "Modern
      architects cannot attain the massive simplicity of these structures. They
      have a kind of confectionery style with false ornament, and inappropriate
      decoration, that bears about the same relation to the original that a suit
      of Drury Lane tinfoil does to a coat of Milanese mail armor. This gallery
      is in excellent taste."
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he spoke, the door in front of him opened, and the pale,
      sorrow-struck, and sickly figure of Glencore stood before him. Upton, with
      all his self-command, could scarcely repress an exclamation at the sight
      of one whom he had seen last in all the pride of youth and great personal
      powers; while Glencore, with the instinctive acuteness of his morbid
      temperament, as quickly saw the impression he had produced, and said, with
      a deep sigh,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, Horace, a sad wreck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so, my dear fellow," said the other, taking the thin, cold hand
      within both his own; "as seaworthy as ever, after a little dry-docking and
      refitting. It is only a craft like that yonder," and he pointed to
      Harcourt, "that can keep the sea in all weathers, and never care for the
      carpenter. You and I are of another build."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you&mdash;how are you?" asked Glencore, relieved to turn attention
      away from himself, while he drew his arm within the other's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same poor ailing mortal you always knew me," said Upton, languidly;
      "doomed to a life of uncongenial labor, condemned to climates totally
      unstated to me, I drag along existence, only astonished at the trouble I
      take to live, knowing pretty well as I do what life is worth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Jolly companions every one!' By Jove!" said Har-court, "for a pair of
      fellows who were born on the sunny side of the road, I must say you are
      marvellous instances of gratitude."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That excellent hippopotamus," said Upton, "has no-thought for any
      calamity if it does not derange his digestion! How glad I am to see the
      soup! Now, Glencore, you shall witness no invalid's appetite."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the dinner proceeded, the tone of the conversation grew gradually
      lighter and pleasanter. Upton had only to permit his powers to take their
      free course to be agreeable, and now talked away on whatever came
      uppermost, with a charming union of reflectiveness and repartee. If a very
      rigid purist might take occasional Gallicisms in expression, and a
      constant leaning to French modes of thought, none could fail to be
      delighted with the graceful ease with which he wandered from theme to
      theme, adorning each with some trait of that originality which was his
      chief characteristic. Harcourt was pleased without well knowing how or
      why, while to Glencore it brought back the memory of the days of happy
      intercourse with the world, and all the brilliant hours of that polished
      circle in which he had lived. To the pleasure, then, which his powers
      conferred, there succeeded an impression of deep melancholy, so deep as to
      attract the notice of Harcourt, who hastily asked,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he felt ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not worse," said he, faintly, "but weak&mdash;weary; and I know Upton
      will forgive me if I say good-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a wreck indeed!" exclaimed Upton, as Glencore left the room with his
      son. "I'd not have known him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet until the last half-hour I have not seen him so well for weeks
      past. I 'm afraid something you said about Alicia Villars affected him,"
      said Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Harcourt, how young you are in all these things," said Upton, as
      he lighted his cigarette. "A poor heart-stricken fellow, like Glencore, no
      more cares for what <i>you</i> would think a painful allusion, than an old
      weather-beaten sailor would for a breezy morning on the Downs at Brighton.
      His own sorrows lie too deeply moored to be disturbed by the light winds
      that ruffle the surface. And to think that all this is a woman's doing! Is
      n't that what's passing in your mind, eh, most gallant Colonel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove, and so it was! They were the very words I was on the point of
      uttering," said Harcourt, half nettled at the ease with which the other
      read him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And of course you understand the source of the sorrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not quite so sure of that," said Harcourt, more and more piqued at
      the tone of bantering superiority with which the other spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you do, Harcourt; I know you better than you know yourself. Your
      thoughts were these: Here's a fellow with a title, a good name, good
      looks, and a fine fortune, going out of the world of a broken heart, and
      all for a woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You knew her," said Harcourt, anxious to divert the discussion from
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Intimately. Ninetta della Torre was the belle of Florence&mdash;what am I
      saying? of all Italy&mdash;when Glencore met her, about eighteen years
      ago. The Palazzo della Torre was the best house in Florence. The old
      Prince, her grandfather,&mdash;her father was killed in the Russian
      campaign,&mdash;was spending the last remnant of an immense fortune in
      every species of extravagance. Entertainments that surpassed those of the
      Pitti Palace in splendor, fêtes that cost fabulous sums, banquets
      voluptuous as those of ancient Rome, were things of weekly occurrence. Of
      course every foreigner, with any pretension to distinction, sought to be
      presented there, and we English happened just at that moment to stand
      tolerably high in Italian estimation. I am speaking of some eighteen or
      twenty years back, before we sent out that swarm of domestic economists
      who, under the somewhat erroneous notion of foreign cheapness, by a system
      of incessant higgle and bargain, cutting down every one's demand to the
      measure of their own pockets, end by making the word 'Englishman' a
      synonym for all that is mean, shabby, and contemptible. The English of
      that day were of another class; and assuredly their characteristics, as
      regards munificence and high dealing, must have been strongly impressed
      upon the minds of foreigners, seeing how their successors, very different
      people, have contrived to trade upon the mere memory of these qualities
      ever since."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which all means that 'my lord' stood cheating better than those who came
      after him," said Harcourt, bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did so; and precisely for that very reason he conveyed the notion of a
      people who do not place money in the first rank of all their speculations,
      and who aspire to no luxury that they have not a just right to enjoy. But
      to come back to Glencore. He soon became a favored guest at the Palazzo
      della Torre. His rank, name, and station, combined with very remarkable
      personal qualities, obtained for him a high place in the old Prince's
      favor, and Ninetta deigned to accord him a little more notice than she
      bestowed on any one else. I have, in the course of my career, had occasion
      to obtain a near view of royal personages and their habits, and I can say
      with certainty that never in any station, no matter how exalted, have I
      seen as haughty a spirit as in that girl. To the pride of her birth, rank,
      and splendid mode of life were added the consciousness of her surpassing
      beauty, and the graceful charm of a manner quite unequalled. She was
      incomparably superior to all around her, and, strangely enough, she did
      not offend by the bold assertion of this superiority. It seemed her due,
      and no more. Nor was it the assumption of mere flattered beauty. Her house
      was the resort of persons of the very highest station, and in the midst of
      them&mdash;some even of royal blood&mdash;she exacted all the deference
      and all the homage that she required from others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And they accorded it?" asked Harcourt, half contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They did; and so had you also if you had been in their place! Believe me,
      most gallant Colonel, there is a wide difference between the empty
      pretension of mere vanity and the daring assumption of conscious power.
      This girl saw the influence she wielded. As she moved amongst us she
      beheld the homage, not always willing, that awaited her. She felt that she
      had but to distinguish any one man there, and he became for the time as
      illustrious as though touched by the sword or ennobled by the star of his
      sovereign. The courtier-like attitude of men, in the presence of a very
      beautiful woman, is a spectacle full of interest. In the homage vouchsafed
      to mere rank there enters always a sense of humiliation, and in the
      observances of respect men tender to royalty, the idea of vassalage
      presents itself most prominently; whereas in the other case, the
      chivalrous devotion is not alloyed by this meaner servitude, and men never
      lift their heads more haughtily than after they have bowed them in lowly
      deference to loveliness."
    </p>
    <p>
      A thick, short snort from Harcourt here startled the speaker, who,
      inspired by the sounds of his own voice and the flowing periods he
      uttered, had fallen into one of those paroxysms of loquacity which now and
      then befell him. That his audience should have thought him tiresome or
      prosy, would, indeed, have seemed to him something strange; but that his
      hearer should have gone off asleep, was almost incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is quite true," said Upton to himself; "he snores 'like a warrior
      taking his rest.' What wonderful gifts some fellows are endowed with! and,
      to enjoy life, there is none of them all like dulness. Can you show me to
      my room?" said he, as Craggs answered his ring at the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Corporal bowed an assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Colonel usually retires early, I suppose?" said Upton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; at ten to a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! it is one&mdash;nearly half-past one&mdash;now, I perceive," said he,
      looking at his watch. "That accounts for his drowsiness," muttered he,
      between his teeth. "Curious vegetables are these old campaigners. Wish him
      good night for me when he awakes, will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And so saying, he proceeded on his way, with all that lassitude and
      exhaustion which it was his custom to throw into every act which demanded
      the slightest exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any more stairs to mount, Mr. Craggs?" said he, with a bland but sickly
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; two flights more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear! couldn't you have disposed of me on the lower floor?&mdash;I
      don't care where or how, but something that requires no climbing. It
      matters little, however, for I'm only here for a day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We could fit up a small room, sir, off the library."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so, then. A most humane thought; for if I <i>should</i> remain another
      night&mdash;Not at it yet?" cried he, peevishly, at the aspect of an
      almost perpendicular stair before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is the last flight, sir; and you'll have a splendid view for your
      trouble, when you awake in the morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no view ever repaid the toil of an ascent, Mr. Craggs, whether
      it be to an attic or the Righi. Would you kindly tell my servant, Mr.
      Schöfer, where to find me, and let him fetch the pillows, and put a little
      rosemary in a glass of water in the room,&mdash;it corrects the odor of
      the night-lamp. And I should like my coffee early,&mdash;say at seven,
      though I don't wish to be disturbed afterwards. Thank you, Mr. Craggs,&mdash;good-night.
      Oh! one thing more. You have a doctor here: would you just mention to him
      that I should like to see him to-morrow about nine or half-past? Good
      night, good night."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a smile worthy of bestowal upon a court beauty, and a gentle
      inclination of the head, the very ideal of gracefulness, Sir Horace
      dismissed Mr. Craggs, and closed the door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. A MEDICAL VISIT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Schöfer moved through the dimly lighted chamber with all the cat-like
      stealthiness of an accomplished valet, arranging the various articles of
      his master's wardrobe, and giving, so far as he was able, the semblance of
      an accustomed spot to this new and strange locality. Already, indeed, it
      was very unlike what it had been during Harcourt's occupation. Guns,
      whips, fishing-tackle, dog-leashes, and landing-nets had all disappeared,
      as well as uncouth specimens of costume for boating or the chase; and in
      their place were displayed all the accessories of an elaborate toilet,
      laid out with a degree of pomp and ostentation somewhat in contrast to the
      place. A richly embroidered dressing-gown lay on the back of a chair,
      before which stood a pair of velvet slippers worked in gold. On the table
      in front of these, a whole regiment of bottles, of varied shape and color,
      were ranged, the contents being curious essences and delicate odors, every
      one of which entered into some peculiar stage of that elaborate process
      Sir Horace Upton went through, each morning of his life, as a preparation
      for the toils of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjoining the bed stood a smaller table, covered with various medicaments,
      tinctures, essences, infusions, and extracts, whose subtle qualities he
      was well skilled in, and but for whose timely assistance he would not have
      believed himself capable of surviving throughout the day. Beside these was
      a bulky file of prescriptions, the learned documents of doctors of every
      country of Europe, all of whom had enjoyed their little sunshine of favor,
      and all of whom had ended by "mistaking his case." These had now been
      placed in readiness for the approaching consultation with "Glencore's
      doctor;" and Mr. Schöfer still glided noiselessly from place to place,
      preparing for that event.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm not asleep, Fritz," said a weak, plaintive voice from the bed. "Let
      me have my aconite,&mdash;eighteen drops; a full dose to-day, for this
      journey has brought back the pains."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Excellenz," said Fritz, in a voice of broken accentuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I slept badly," continued his master, in the same complaining tone. "The
      sea beat so heavily against the rocks, and the eternal plash, plash, all
      night irritated and worried me. Are you giving me the right tincture?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Excellenz," was the brief reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have seen the doctor,&mdash;what is he like, Fritz?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange grimace and a shrug of the shoulders were Mr. Schöfer's only
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought as much," said Upton, with a heavy sigh. "They called him the
      wild growth of the mountains last night, and I fancied what that was like
      to prove. Is he young?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A shake of the head implied not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor old?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Another similar movement answered the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me a comb, Fritz, and fetch the glass here." And now Sir Horace
      arranged his silky hair more becomingly, and having exchanged one or two
      smiles with his image in the mirror, lay back on the pillow, saying, "Tell
      him I am ready to see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schöfer proceeded to the door, and at once presented the obsequious
      figure of Billy Traynor, who, having heard some details of the rank and
      quality of his new patient, made his approaches with a most deferential
      humility. It was true, Billy knew that my Lord Glencore's rank was above
      that of Sir Horace, but to his eyes there was the far higher distinction
      of a man of undoubted ability,&mdash;a great speaker, a great writer, a
      great diplomatist; and Billy Traynor, for the first time in his life,
      found himself in the presence of one whose claims to distinction stood
      upon the lofty basis of personal superiority. Now, though bashful-ness was
      not the chief characteristic of his nature, he really felt abashed and
      timid as he drew near the bed, and shrank under the quick but searching
      glance of the sick man's cold gray eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Place a chair, and leave us, Fritz," said Sir Horace; and then, turning
      slowly round, smiled as he said, "I'm happy to make your acquaintance,
      sir. My friend, Lord Glencore, has told me with what skill you treated
      him, and I embrace the fortunate occasion to profit by your professional
      ability."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm your humble slave, sir," said Billy, with a deep, rich brogue; and
      the manner of the speaker, and his accent, seemed so to surprise Upton
      that he continued to stare at him fixedly for some seconds without
      speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You studied in Scotland, I believe?" said he, with one of the most
      engaging smiles, while he hazarded the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, then, I did not, sir," said Billy, with a heavy sigh; "all I know
      of the <i>ars medicâtrix</i> I picked up,&mdash;<i>currendo per campos</i>,&mdash;as
      one may say, vagabondizing through life, and watching my opportunities.
      Nature gave me the Hippocratic turn, and I did my best to improve it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that you never took out a regular diploma?" said Sir Horace, with
      another and still blander smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorra one, sir! I 'm a doctor just as a man is a poet,&mdash;by sheer
      janius! 'T is the study of nature makes both one and the other; that is,
      when there's the raal stuff,&mdash;the <i>divinus afflatus</i>,&mdash;inside.
      Without you have that, you 're only a rhymester or a quack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would, then, trace a parallel between them?" said Upton, graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure, sir! Ould Heyric says that the poet and the physician is one:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "'For he who reads the clouded skies,
        And knows the utterings of the deep,
     Can surely see in human eyes
        The sorrows that so heart-locked sleep.'
</pre>
    <p>
      The human system is just a kind of universe of its own; and the very same
      faculties that investigate the laws of nature in one case is good in the
      other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think the author of 'King Arthur' supports your theory," said
      Upton, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blackmoor was an ass; but maybe he was as great a bosthoon in physic as
      in poetry," rejoined Billy, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Doctor," said Sir Horace, with one of those plaintive sighs in
      which he habitually opened the narrative of his own suffering, "let us
      descend to meaner things, and talk of myself. You see before you one who,
      in some degree, is the reproach of medicine. That file of prescriptions
      beside you will show that I have consulted almost every celebrity in
      Europe; and that I have done so unsuccessfully, it is only necessary that
      you should look on these worn looks&mdash;these wasted fingers&mdash;this
      sickly, feeble frame. Vouchsafe me a patient hearing for a few moments,
      while I give you some insight into one of the most intricate cases,
      perhaps, that has ever engaged the faculty."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not our intention to follow Sir Horace through his statement, which
      in reality comprised a sketch of half the ills that the flesh is heir to.
      Maladies of heart, brain, liver, lungs, the nerves, the arteries, even the
      bones, contributed their aid to swell the dreary catalogue, which, indeed,
      contained the usual contradictions and exaggerations incidental to such
      histories. We could not assuredly expect from our reader the patient
      attention with which Billy listened to this narrative. Never by a word did
      he interrupt the description; not even a syllable escaped him as he sat;
      and even when Sir Horace had finished speaking, he remained with slightly
      drooped head and clasped hands in deep meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a strange thing," said he, at last; "but the more I see of the
      aristocracy, the more I 'm convinced that they ought to have doctors for
      themselves alone, just as they have their own tailors and coachmakers,&mdash;-chaps
      that could devote themselves to the study of physic for the peerage, and
      never think of any other disorders but them that befall people of rank.
      Your mistake, Sir Horace, was in consulting the regular middle-class
      practitioner, who invariably imagined there must be a disease to treat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you set me down as a hypochondriac, then," said Upton, smiling.

      "Nothing of the kind! You have a malady, sure enough, but nothing organic.
      'Tis the oceans of tinctures, the sieves full of pills, the quarter-casks
      of bitters you 're takin', has played the divil with you. The human
      machine is like a clock, and it depends on the proportion the parts bear
      to each other, whether it keeps time. You may make the spring too strong,
      or the chain too thick, or the balance too heavy for the rest of the
      works, and spoil everything just by over security. That's what your
      doctors was doing with their tonics and cordials. They didn't see, here's
      a poor washy frame, with a wake circulation and no vigor. If we nourish
      him, his heart will go quicker, to be sure; but what will his brain be at?
      There's the rub! His brain will begin to go fast too, and already it's
      going the pace. 'T is soothin' and calmin' you want; allaying the
      irritability of an irrascible, fretful nature, always on the watch for
      self-torment. Say-bathin', early hours, a quiet mopin' kind of life, that
      would, maybe, tend to torpor and sleepiness,&mdash;them's the first things
      you need; and for exercise, a little work in the garden that you 'd take
      interest in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And no physic?" asked Sir Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorra screed! not as much as a powder or a draught,&mdash;barrin'," said
      he, suddenly catching the altered expression of the sick man's face, "a
      little mixture of hyoscyamus I' ll compound for you myself. This, and
      friction over the region of the heart, with a mild embrocation, is all my
      tratement!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you have hopes of my recovery?" asked Sir Horace, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name isn't Billy Traynor if I'd not send you out of this hale and
      hearty before two months. I read you like a printed book."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You really give me great confidence, for I perceive you understand the
      tone of my temperament. Let us try this same embrocation at once; I'll
      most implicitly obey you in everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My head on a block, then, but I'll cure you," said Billy, who determined
      that no scruples on his side should mar the trust reposed in him by the
      patient. "But you must give yourself entirely up to me; not only as to
      your eatin' and drinkin', but your hours of recreation and study,
      exercise, amusement, and all, must be at my biddin'. It is the principle
      of harmony between the moral and physical nature constitutes the whole
      sacret of my system. To be stimulatin' the nerves, and lavin' the arteries
      dormant, is like playing a jig to minuet time,&mdash;all must move in
      simultaneous action; and the cerebellum, the great flywheel of the whole,
      must be made to keep orderly time. D'ye mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I follow you with great interest," said Sir Horace, to whose subtle
      nature there was an intense pleasure in the thought of having discovered
      what he deemed a man of original genius under this unpromising exterior.
      "There is but one bar to these arrangements: I must leave this at once; I
      ought to go to-day. I must be off to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'll not take the helm when I can't pilot you through the shoals,"
      said Billy. "To begin my system, and see you go away before I developed my
      grand invigoratin' arcanum, would be only to destroy your confidence in an
      elegant discovery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were I only as certain as you seem to be&mdash;&mdash;" began
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Horace, and then stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 'd stay and be cured, you were goin' to say. Well, if you did n't
      feel that same trust in me, you 'd be right to go; for it is that very
      confidence that turns the balance. Ould Babbington used to say that
      between a good physician and a bad one there was just the difference
      between a pound and a guinea. But between the one you trust and the one
      you don't, there's all the way between Billy Traynor and the Bank of
      Ireland!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On that score every advantage is with you," said Upton, with all the
      winning grace of his incomparable manner; "and I must now bethink me how I
      can manage to prolong my stay here." And with this he fell into a musing
      fit, letting drop occasionally some stray word or two, to mark the current
      of his thoughts: "The Duke of Headwater's on the thirteenth; Ardroath
      Castle the Tuesday after; More-hampton for the Derby day. These easily
      disposed of. Prince Boratinsky, about that Warsaw affair, must be attended
      to; a letter, yes, a letter, will keep that question open. Lady Grencliffe
      <i>is</i> a difficulty; if I plead illness, she 'll say I 'm not strong
      enough to go to Russia. I 'll think it over." And with this he rested his
      head on his hands, and sank into profound reflection. "Yes, Doctor," said
      he, at length, as though summing up his secret calculations, "health is
      the first requisite. If you can but restore me, you will be&mdash;I am
      above the mere personal consideration&mdash;you will be the means of
      conferring an important service on the King's Government. A variety of
      questions, some of them deep and intricate, are now pending, of which I
      alone understand the secret meaning. A new hand would infallibly spoil the
      game; and yet, in my present condition, how could I hear the fatigues of
      long interviews, ministerial deliberations, incessant note-writing, and
      evasive conversations?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Utterly unpossible!" exclaimed the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you observe, it is utterly impossible," rejoined Sir Horace, with one
      of his own dubious smiles; and then, in a manner more natural, resumed:
      "We public men have the sad necessity of concealing the sufferings on
      which others trade for sympathy. We must never confess to an ache or a
      pain, lest it be rumored that we are unequal to the fatigues of office;
      and so is it that we are condemned to run the race with broken health and
      shattered frame, alleging all the while that no exertion is too much, no
      effort too great for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And maybe, after all, it's that very struggle that makes you more than
      common men," said Billy. "There's a kind of irritability that keeps the
      brain at stretch, and renders it equal to higher efforts than ever
      accompany good everyday health. Dyspepsia is the soul of a prose-writer,
      and a slight ossification of the aortic valves is a great help to the
      imagination."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really say so?" asked Sir Horace, with all the implicit confidence
      with which he accepted any marvel that had its origin in medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you feel it yourself, sir?" asked Billy. "Do you ever pen a reply
      to a knotty state-paper as nately as when you've the heartburn?&mdash;are
      you ever as epigrammatic as when you're driven to a listen slipper?&mdash;and
      when do you give a minister a jobation as purtily as when you are laborin'
      under a slight indigestion? Not that it would sarve a man to be
      permanently in gout or the colic; but for a spurt like a cavalry charge,
      there's nothing like eatin' something that disagrees with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An ingenious notion," said the diplomatist, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now I 'll take my lave," said Billy, rising. "I'm going out to gather
      some mountain-colchicum and sorrel, to make a diaphoretic infusion; and
      I've to give Master Charles his Greek lesson; and blister the colt,&mdash;he's
      thrown out a bone spavin; and, after that, Handy Care's daughter has the
      shakin' ague, and the smith at the forge is to be bled,&mdash;all before
      two o 'dock, when 'the lord' sends for me. But the rest of the day, and
      the night too, I'm your honor's obaydient."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a low bow, repeated in a more reverential man-ner at the door,
      Billy took his leave and retired.

      CHAPTER X. A DISCLOSURE
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Have you seen Upton?" asked Glencore eagerly of Harcourt as he entered
      his bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; he vouchsafed me an audience during his toilet, just as the old
      kings of France were accustomed to honor a favorite with one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is he full of miseries at the dreary place, the rough fare and
      deplorable resources of this wild spot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite the reverse; he is charmed with everything and everybody. The view
      from his window is glorious; the air has already invigorated him. For
      years he has not breakfasted with the same appetite; and he finds that of
      all the places he has ever chanced upon, this is the one veritable exact
      spot which suits him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is very kind on his part," said Glencore, with a faint smile. "Will
      the humor last, Harcourt? That is the question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust it will,&mdash;at least it may well endure for the short period
      he means to stay; although already he has extended that, and intends
      remaining till next week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better still," said Glencore, with more animation of voice and manner. "I
      was already growing nervous about the brief space in which I was to crowd
      in all that I want to say to him; but if he will consent to wait a day or
      two, I hope I shall be equal to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In his present mood there is no impatience to be off; on the contrary, he
      has been inquiring as to all the available means of locomotion, and by
      what convenience he is to make various sea and land excursions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have no carriage,&mdash;we have no roads, even," said Glencore,
      peevishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He knows all that; but he is concerting measures about a certain
      turf-kish, I think they call it, which, by the aid of pillows to lie on,
      and donkeys to drag, can be made a most useful vehicle; while, for longer
      excursions, he has suggested a 'conveniency' of wheels and axles to the
      punt, rendering it equally eligible on land or water. Then he has been
      designing great improvements in horticulture, and giving orders about a
      rake, a spade, and a hoe for himself. I 'm quite serious," said Harcourt,
      as Glencore smiled with a kind of droll incredulity. "It is perfectly
      true; and as he hears that the messenger occasionally crosses the lough to
      the post, when there are no letters there, he hints at a little simple
      telegraph for Leenane, which should announce what the mail contains, and
      which might be made useful to convey other intelligence. In fact, all <i>my</i>
      changes here will be as for nothing to <i>his</i> reforms, and between us
      you 'll not know your own house again, if you even be able to live in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have already done much to make it more habitable, Harcourt," said
      Glencore, feelingly; "and if I had not the grace to thank you for it, I 'm
      not the less grateful. To say truth, my old friend, I half doubted whether
      it was an act of friendship to attach me ever so lightly to a life of
      which I am well weary. Ceasing as I have done for years back to feel
      interest in anything, I dread whatever may again recall me to the world of
      hopes and fears,&mdash;that agitated sea of passion wherein I have no
      longer vigor to contend. To speak to me, then, of plans to carry out,
      schemes to accomplish, was to point to a future of activity and exertion;
      and!"&mdash;here he dropped his voice to a deep and mournful tone&mdash;"can
      have but one future,&mdash;the dark and dreary one before the grave!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harcourt was too deeply impressed by the solemnity of these words to
      venture on a reply, and he sat silently contemplating the sorrow-struck
      but placid features of the sick man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing to prevent a man struggling, and successfully too,
      against mere adverse fortune," continued Glencore. "I feel at times that
      if I had been suddenly reduced to actual beggary,&mdash;left without a
      shilling in the world,&mdash;there are many ways in which I could eke out
      subsistence. A great defeat to my personal ambition I could resist. The
      casualty that should exclude me from a proud position and public life, I
      could bear up against with patience, and I hope with dignity. Loss of
      fortune, loss of influence, loss of station, loss of health even, dearer
      than them all, can be borne. There is but one intolerable ill, one that no
      time alleviates, no casuistry diminishes,&mdash;loss of honor! Ay,
      Harcourt, rank and riches do little for him who feels himself the inferior
      of the meanest that elbows him in a crowd; and the man whose name is a
      scoff and a jibe has but one part to fill,&mdash;to make himself
      forgotten."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope I 'm not deficient in a sense of personal honor, Glencore," said
      Harcourt; "but I must say that I think your reasoning on this point is
      untenable and wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us not speak more of it," said Glencore, faintly. "I know not how I
      have been led to allude to what it is better to bear in secret than to
      confide even to friendship;" and he pressed the strong fingers of the
      other as he spoke, in his own feeble grasp. "Leave me now, Harcourt, and
      send Upton here. It may be that the time is come when I shall be able to
      speak to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are too weak to-day, Glencore,&mdash;too much agitated. Pray defer
      this interview."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Harcourt; these are my moments of strength. The little energy now
      left to me is the fruit of strong excitement. Heaven knows how I shall be
      to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harcourt made no further opposition, but left the room in search of Upton.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was full an hour later when Sir Horace Upton made his appearance in
      Glencore's chamber, attired in a purple dressing-gown, profusely braided
      with gold, loose trousers as richly brocaded, and a pair of real Turkish
      slippers, resplendent with costly embroidery; a small fez of blue velvet,
      with a deep gold tassel, covered the top of his head, at either side of
      which his soft silky hair descended in long massy waves, apparently
      negligently, but in reality arranged with all the artistic regard to
      effect of a consummate master. From the gold girdle at his waist depended
      a watch, a bunch of keys, a Turkish purse, an embroidered tobacco-bag, a
      gorgeously chased smelling-bottle, and a small stiletto, with a topaz
      handle. In one hand he carried a meerschaum, the other leaned upon a cane,
      and with all the dependence of one who could not walk without its aid. The
      greeting was cordial and affectionate on both sides; and when Sir Horace,
      after a variety of preparations to ensure his comfort, at length seated
      himself beside the bed, his features beamed with all their wonted
      gentleness and kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm charmed at what Harcourt has been telling me, Upton," said Glencore;
      "and that you really can exist in all the savagery of this wild spot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm in ecstasy with the place, Glencore. My memory cannot recall the same
      sensations of health and vigor I have experienced since I came here. Your
      cook is first-rate; your fare is exquisite; the quiet is a positive
      blessing; and that queer creature, your doctor, is a very remarkable
      genius."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he is," said Glencore, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of those men of original mould who leave cultivation leagues behind,
      and arrive at truth by a bound."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He certainly treated me with considerable skill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm satisfied of it; his conversation is replete with shrewd and
      intelligent observation, and he seems to have studied his art more like a
      philosopher than a mere physician of the schools. And depend upon it,
      Glencore, the curative art must mainly depend upon the secret instinct
      which divines the malady, less by the rigid rules of acquired skill than
      by that prerogative of genius, which, however exerted, arrives at its goal
      at once. Our conversation had scarcely lasted a quarter of an hour, when
      he revealed to me the exact seat of all my sufferings, and the most
      perfect picture of my temperament. And then his suggestions as to
      treatment were all so reasonable, so well argued."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A clever fellow, no doubt of it," said Glencore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he is far more than that, Glencore. Cleverness is only a
      manufacturing quality,&mdash;that man supplies the raw article also. It
      has often struck me as very singular that such heads are not found in <i>our</i>
      class,&mdash;they belong to another order altogether. It is possible that
      the stimulus of necessity engenders the greatest of all efforts, calling
      to the operations of the mind the continued strain for contrivance; and
      thus do we find the most remarkable men are those, every step of whose
      knowledge has been gained with a struggle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suspect you are right," said Glencore, "and that our old system of
      school education, wherein all was rough, rugged, and difficult, turned out
      better men than the present-day habit of everything-made-easy and
      everybody-made-any-thing. Flippancy is the characteristic of our age, and
      we owe it to our teaching."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way, what do you mean to do with Charley?" said Upton. "Do you
      intend him for Eton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I scarcely know,&mdash;I make plans only to abandon them," said Glencore,
      gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm greatly struck with him. He is one of those fellows, however, who
      require the nicest management, and who either rise superior to all around
      them, or drop down into an indolent, dreamy existence, conscious of power,
      but too bashful or too lazy to exert it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have hit him off, Upton, with all your own subtlety; and it was to
      speak of that boy I have been so eager to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore paused as he said these words, and passed his hand over his brow,
      as though to prepare himself for the task before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upton," said he, at last, in a voice of deep and solemn meaning, "the
      resolution I am about to impart to you is not unlikely to meet your
      strenuous opposition; you will be disposed to show me strong reasons
      against it on every ground; you may refuse me that amount of assistance I
      shall ask of you to carry out my purpose; but if your arguments were all
      unanswerable, and if your denial to aid me was to sever the old friendship
      between us, I 'd still persist in my determination. For more than two
      years the project has been before my mind. The long hours of the day, the
      longer ones of the night, have found me deep in the consideration of it. I
      have repeated over to myself everything that my ingenuity could suggest
      against it; I have said to my own heart all that my worst enemy could
      utter, were he to read the scheme and detect my plan; I have done more,&mdash;I
      have struggled with myself to abandon it; but in vain. My heart is linked
      to it; it forms the one sole tie that attaches me to life. Without it, the
      apathy that I feel stealing over me would be complete, and my existence
      become a mournful dream. In a word, Upton, all is passionless within me,
      save one sentiment; and I drag on life merely for a '<i>Vendetta</i>.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Upton shook his head mournfully, as the other paused here, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is disease, Glencore!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so; the malady is beyond cure," said he, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trust me it is not so," said Upton, gently; "you listened to my
      persuasions on a more&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, that I did!" cried Glencore, interrupting; "and have I ever ceased to
      rue the day I did so? But for <i>your</i> arguments, and I had not lived
      this life of bitter, self-reproaching misery; but for you, and my
      vengeance had been sated ere this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember, Glencore," said the other, "that you had obtained all the world
      has decreed as satisfaction. He met you and received your fire; you shot
      him through the chest,&mdash;not mortally, it is true, but to carry to his
      grave a painful, lingering disease. To have insisted on his again meeting
      you would have been little less than murder. No man could have stood your
      friend in such a quarrel. I told you so then, I repeat it now, <i>he</i>
      could not fire at you; what, then, was it possible for you to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shoot him,&mdash;shoot him like a dog!" cried Glencore, while his eyes
      gleamed like the glittering eyes of an enraged beast. "You talk of his
      lingering life of pain: think of <i>mine</i>; have some sympathy for what
      <i>I</i> suffer! Would all the agony of <i>his</i> whole existence equal
      one hour of the torment he has bequeathed to me, its shame and ignominy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "These are things which passion can never treat of, my dear Glencore."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Passion alone can feel them," said the other, sternly. "Keep subtleties
      for those who use like weapons. As for me, no casuistry is needed to tell
      me I am dishonored, and just as little to tell me I must be avenged! If <i>you</i>
      think differently, it were better not to discuss this question further
      between us; but I did think I could have reckoned upon you, for I felt you
      had barred my first chance of a vengeance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, then, for your plan, Glencore," said Upton, who, with all the
      dexterity of his calling, preferred opening a new channel in the
      discussion, to aggravating difficulties by a further opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must rid myself of her! There's my plan!" cried Glencore, savagely.
      "You have it all in that resolution. Of no avail is it that I have
      separated my fortune from hers, so long as she bears my name, and renders
      it infamous in every city of Europe. Is it to <i>you</i>, who live in the
      world,&mdash;who mix with men of every country,&mdash;that I need tell
      this? If a man cannot throw off such a shame, he must sink under it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you told me you had an unconquerable aversion to the notion of
      seeking a divorce."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I had; so I have! The indelicate, the ignominious course of a trial at
      law, with all its shocking exposure, would be worse than a thousand
      deaths! To survive the suffering of all the licensed ribaldry of some
      gowned coward aspersing one's honor, calumniating, inventing, and, when
      invention failed, suggesting motives, the very thought of which in secret
      had driven a man to madness! To endure this&mdash;to read it&mdash;to know
      it went published over the wide globe, till one's shame became the gossip
      of millions&mdash;and then&mdash;with a verdict extorted from pity,
      damages awarded to repair a broken heart and a sullied name&mdash;to carry
      this disgrace before one's equals, to be again discussed, sifted, and
      cavilled at! No, Upton; this poor shattered brain would give way under
      such a trial; to compass it in mere fancy is already nigh to madness! It
      must be by other means than these that I attain my object!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The terrible energy with which he spoke actually frightened Upton, who
      fancied that his reason had already begun to show signs of decline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The world has decreed," resumed Glencore, "that in these conflicts all
      the shame shall be the husband's; but it shall not be so here! <i>She</i>
      shall have her share, ay, and, by Heaven, not the smaller share either!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what would you do?" asked Upton, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Deny my marriage; call her my mistress!" cried Glencore, in a voice
      shaken with passion and excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But your boy,&mdash;your son, Glencore!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He shall be a bastard! You may hold up your hands in horror, and look
      with all your best got-up disgust at such a scheme; but if you wish to see
      me swear to accomplish it, I'll do so now before you, ay, on my knees
      before you! When we eloped from her father's house at Castellamare, we
      were married by a priest at Capri; of the marriage no trace exists. The
      more legal ceremony was performed before you, as Chargé d'Affaires at
      Naples,&mdash;of that I have the registry here; nor, except my courier,
      Sanson, is there a living witness. If you determine to assert it, you will
      do so without a fragment of proof, since every document that could
      substantiate it is in my keeping. You shall see them for yourself. She is,
      therefore, in my power; and will any man dare to tell me how I should
      temper that power?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But your boy, Glencore, your boy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is my boy's station in the world a prouder one by being the son of the
      notorious Lady Glencore, or as the offspring of a nameless mistress? What
      avail to him that he should have a title stained by <i>her</i> shame?
      Where is he to go? In what land is he to live, where her infamy has not
      reached? Is it not a thousand times better that he enter life ignoble and
      unknown,&mdash;to start in the world's race with what he may of strength
      and power,&mdash;than drag on an unhonored existence, shunned by his
      equals, and only welcome where it is disgrace to find companionship?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you surely have never contemplated all the consequences of this rash
      resolve. It is the extinction of an ancient title, the alienation of a
      great estate, when once you have declared your boy illegitimate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is a beggar: I know it; the penalty he must pay is a heavy one. But
      think of <i>her</i>, Upton,&mdash;think of the haughty Viscountess,
      revelling in splendor, and, even in all her shame, the flattered, welcomed
      guest of that rotten, corrupt society she lives in. Imagine her in all the
      pride of wealth and beauty, sought after, adulated, worshipped as she is,
      suddenly struck down by the brand of this disgrace, and left upon the
      world without fortune, without rank, without even a name. To be shunned
      like a leper by the very meanest of those it had once been an honor when
      she recognized them. Picture to yourself this woman, degraded to the
      position of all that is most vile and contemptible. She, that scarcely
      condescended to acknowledge as her equals the best-born and the highest,
      sunk down to the hopeless infamy of a mistress. They tell me she laughed
      on the day I fainted at seeing her entering the San Carlos at Naples,&mdash;laughed
      as they carried me down the steps into the fresh air! Will she laugh now,
      think you? Shall I be called 'Le Pauvre Sire' when she hears this? Was
      there ever a vengeance more terrible, more complete?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Again, I say, Glencore, you have no right to involve others in the
      penalty of her fault. Laying aside every higher motive, you can have no
      more right to deny your boy's claim to his rank and fortune than I or any
      one else. It cannot be alienated nor extinguished; by his birth he became
      the heir to your title and estates."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has no birth, sir, he is a bastard: who shall deny it? <i>You</i>
      may," added he, after a second's pause; "but where's your proof? Is not
      every probability as much against you as all documentary evidence, since
      none will ever believe that I could rob myself of the succession, and make
      over my fortune to Heaven knows what remote relation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you expect me to become a party to this crime?" asked Upton,
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You balked me in one attempt at vengeance, and I think you owe me a
      reparation!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glencore," said Upton, solemnly, "we are both of us men of the world,&mdash;men
      who have seen life in all its varied aspects sufficiently to know the
      hollowness of more than half the pretension men trade upon as principle;
      we have witnessed mean actions and the very lowest motives amongst the
      highest in station; and it is not for either of us to affect any
      overstrained estimate of men's honor and good faith; but I say to you, in
      all sincerity, that not alone do I refuse you all concurrence in the act
      you meditate, but I hold myself open to denounce and frustrate it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do!" cried Glencore, wildly, while with a bound he sat up in his bed,
      grasping the curtain convulsively for support.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be calm, Glencore, and listen to me patiently."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You declare that you will use the confidence of this morning against me!"
      cried Glencore, while the lines in his face became indented more deeply,
      and his bloodless lips quivered with passion. "You take your part with <i>her!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only ask that you would hear me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You owe me four thousand five hundred pounds, Sir Horace Upton," said
      Glencore, in a voice barely above a whisper, but every accent of which was
      audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it, Glencore," said Upton, calmly. "You helped me by a loan of
      that sum in a moment of great difficulty. Your generosity went farther,
      for you took, what nobody else would, my personal security."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore made no reply, but, throwing back the bedclothes, slowly and
      painfully arose, and with tottering and uncertain steps approached a
      table. With a trembling hand he unlocked a drawer, and taking out a paper,
      opened and scanned it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's your bond, sir," said he, with a hollow, cavernous voice, as he
      threw it into the fire, and crushed it down into the flames with a poker.
      "There is now nothing between us. You are free to do your worst!" And as
      he spoke, a few drops of dark blood trickled from his nostril, and he fell
      senseless upon the floor.

      CHAPTER XI. SOME LIGHTS AND SHADOWS OF DIPLOMATIC LIFE
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is a trait in the lives of great diplomatists of which it is just
      possible some one or other of my readers may not have heard, which is,
      that none of them have ever attained to any great eminence without an
      attachment&mdash;we can find no better word for it&mdash;to some woman of
      superior understanding who has united within herself great talents for
      society with a high and soaring ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      They who only recognize in the world of politics the dry details of
      ordinary parliamentary business, poor-law questions, sanitary rules,
      railroad bills, and colonial grants can form but a scanty notion of the
      excitement derived from the high interests of party, and the great game
      played by about twenty mighty gamblers, with the whole world for the
      table, and kingdoms for counters. In this "grand rôle" women perform no
      ignoble part; nay, it were not too much to say that theirs is the very
      motive-power of the whole vast machinery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had we any right to step beyond the limits of our story for illustration,
      it would not be difficult to quote names enough to show that we are
      speaking not at hazard, but "from book," and that great events derive far
      less of their impulse from "the lords" than from "the ladies of creation."
      Whatever be the part they take in these contests, their chief attention is
      ever directed, not to the smaller battle-field of home questions, but to
      the greater and wider campaign of international politics. Men may wrangle
      and hair-split, and divide about a harbor bill or a road cession; but
      women occupy themselves in devising how thrones may be shaken and
      dynasties disturbed,&mdash;how frontiers may be changed, and nationalities
      trafficked; for, strange as it may seem, the stupendous incidents which
      mould human destinies are more under the influence of passion and intrigue
      than the commonest events of every-day life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our readers may, and not very unreasonably, begin to suspect that it was
      in some moment of abstraction we wrote "Glencore" at the head of these
      pages, and that these speculations are but the preface to some very
      abstruse reflections upon the political condition of Europe. But no; they
      are simply intended as a prelude to the fact that Sir Horace Upton was not
      exempt from the weakness of his order, and that he, too, reposed his trust
      upon a woman's judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of his illustrious guide was the Princess Sabloukoff, by birth a
      Pole, but married to a Russian of vast wealth and high family, from whom
      she separated early in life, to mingle in the world with all the
      "prestige" of position, riches, and&mdash;greater than either&mdash;extreme
      beauty, and a manner of such fascination as made her name of European
      celebrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Sir Horace first met her, he was the junior member of our Embassy at
      Naples, and she the distinguished leader of fashion in that city. We are
      not about to busy ourselves with the various narratives which professed to
      explain her influence at Court, or the secret means to which she owed her
      ascendency over royal highnesses, and her sway over cardinals. Enough that
      she possessed such, and that the world knew it. The same success attended
      her at Vienna and at Paris. She was courted and sought after everywhere;
      and if her arrival was not fêted with the public demonstrations that await
      royalty, it was assuredly an event recognized with all that could flatter
      her vanity or minister to her self-esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Sir Horace was presented to her as an Attaché, she simply bowed and
      smiled. He renewed his acquaintance some ten years later as a Secretary,
      when she vouchsafed to say she remembered him. A third time, after a lapse
      of years, he came before her as a Chargé d'Affaires, when she conversed
      with him; and lastly, when time had made him a Minister, and with less
      generosity had laid its impress upon herself, she gave him her hand, and
      said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Horace, how charming to see an old friend, if you will be good
      enough to let me call you so."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was so; he accepted the friendship as frankly as it was proffered.
      He knew that time was when he could have no pretension to this
      distinction: but the beautiful Princess was no longer young; the
      fascinations she had wielded were already a kind of Court tradition;
      archdukes and ambassadors were no more her slaves; nor was she the terror
      of jealous queens and Court favorites. Sir Horace knew all this; but he
      also knew that, she being such, his ambition had never dared to aspire to
      her friendship, and it was only in her days of declining fortune that he
      could hope for such distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this may seem very strange and very odd, dear reader; but we live in
      very strange and very odd times, and more than one-half the world is only
      living on "second-hand,"&mdash;second-hand shawls and second-hand
      speeches, second-hand books, and Court suits and opinions are all rife;
      and why not second-hand friendships?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the friendship between a bygone beauty of forty&mdash;and we will not
      say how many more years&mdash;and a hackneyed, half-disgusted man of the
      world, of the same age, is a very curious contract. There is no love in
      it; as little is there any strong tie of esteem: but there is a wonderful
      bond of self-interest and mutual convenience. Each seems to have at last
      found "one that understands him;" similarity of pursuit has engendered
      similarity of taste. They have each seen the world from exactly the same
      point of view, and they have come out of it equally heart-wearied and
      tired, stored with vast resources of social knowledge, and with a keen
      insight into every phase of that complex machinery by which one-half the
      world cheats the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Sabloukoff was still handsome; she had far more than what is
      ill-naturedly called the remains of good looks. She had a brilliant
      complexion, lustrous dark eyes, and a profusion of the most beautiful
      hair. She was, besides, a most splendid dresser. Her toilet was the very
      perfection of taste, and if a little inclining to over-magnificence, not
      the less becoming to one whose whole air and bearing assumed something of
      queenly dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the world of society there is a very great prestige attends those who
      have at some one time played a great part in life. The deposed king, the
      ex-minister, the banished general, and even the bygone beauty, receive a
      species of respectful homage, which the wider world without-doors is not
      always ready to accord them. Good breeding, in fact, concedes what mere
      justice might deny; and they who have to fall back upon "souvenirs" for
      their greatness, always find their advantage in associating with the class
      whose prerogative is good manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess Sabloukoff was not, however, one of those who can live upon
      the interest of a bygone fame. She saw that, when the time of coquetry and
      its fascinations has passed, still, with faculties like hers, there was
      yet a great game to be played. Hitherto she had only studied characters;
      now she began to reflect upon events. The transition was an easy one, to
      which her former knowledge contributed largely its assistance. There was
      scarcely a royalty, hardly a leading personage, in Europe she did not know
      personally and well. She had lived in intimacy with ministers, and
      statesmen, and great politicians. She knew them in all that "life of the
      <i>salon</i>" where men alternately expand into frankness, and practise
      the wily devices of their crafty callings. She had seen them in all the
      weaknesses, too, of inferior minds, eager after small objects, tormented
      by insignificant cares. They who habitually dealt with these mighty
      personages only beheld them in their dignity of station, or surrounded by
      the imposing accessories of office. What an advantage, then, to regard
      them closer and nearer,&mdash;to be aware of their shortcomings, and
      acquainted with the secret springs of their ambitions!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess and Sir Horace very soon saw that each needed the other. When
      Robert Macaire accidentally met an accomplished gamester who "turned the
      king" as often as he did, and could reciprocate every trick and artifice
      with him, he threw down the cards, saying, "Embrassons-nous, nous sommes
      frères!" Now, the illustration is a very ignoble one, but it conveys no
      very inexact idea of the bond which united these two distinguished
      individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Horace was one of those fine, acute intelligences which may be gapped
      and blunted if applied to rough work, but are splendid instruments where
      you would cut cleanly and cut deep. She saw this at once. He, too,
      recognized in her a wonderful knowledge of life, joined to vast powers of
      employing it with profit. No more was wanting to establish a friendship
      between them. Dispositions must be, to a certain degree, different between
      those who are to live together as friends, but tastes must be alike.
      Theirs were so. They had the same veneration for the same things, the same
      regard for the same celebrities, and the same contempt for the small
      successes which were engaging the minds of many around them. If the
      Princess had a real appreciation of the fine abilities of Sir Horace, he
      estimated at their full value all the resources of her wondrous tact and
      skill, and the fascinations which even yet surrounded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have we said enough to explain the terms of this alliance, or must we make
      one more confession, and own that her insidious praise&mdash;a flattery
      too delicate and fine ever to be committed to absolute eulogy&mdash;convinced
      Sir Horace that she alone, of all the world, was able to comprehend the
      vast stores of his knowledge, and the wide measure of his capacity as a
      statesman?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the great game of statecraft, diplomatists are not above looking into
      each other's hands; but this must always be accomplished by means of a
      confederate. How terribly alike are all human rogueries, whether the scene
      be a conference at Vienna, or the tent of a thimblerig at Ascot! La
      Sabloukoff was unrivalled in the art. She knew how to push raillery and <i>persiflage</i>
      to the very frontiers of truth, and even peep over and see what lay
      beyond. Sir Horace traded on the material with which she supplied him, and
      acquired the reputation of being all that was crafty and subtle in
      diplomacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      How did Upton know this? Whence came he by that? What mysterious source of
      information is he possessed of? Who could have revealed such a secret to
      him? were questions often asked in that dreary old drawing-room of Downing
      Street, where men's destinies are shaped, and the fate of millions
      decided, from four o'clock to six of an afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often and often were the measures of the Cabinet shaped by the tidings
      which arrived with all the speed of a foreign courier; over and over again
      were the speeches in Parliament based upon information received from him.
      It has even happened that the news from his hand has caused the telegraph
      of the Admiralty to signalize the "Thunderer" to put to sea with all
      haste. In a word, he was the trusted agent of our Government, whether
      ruled by a Whig or a Tory, and his despatches were ever regarded as a sure
      warranty for action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English Minister at a Foreign Court labors under one great
      disadvantage, which is, that his policy, and all the consequences that are
      to follow it, are rarely, if ever, shaped with any reference to the state
      of matters then existing in his own country. Absorbed as he is in great
      European questions, how can he follow with sufficient attention the course
      of events at home, or recognize, in the signs and tokens of the division
      list, the changeful fortunes of party? He may be advising energy when the
      cry is all for temporizing; counselling patience and submission, when the
      nation is eager for a row; recommend religious concessions in the very
      week that Exeter Hall is denouncing toleration; or actually suggesting aid
      to a Government that a popular orator has proclaimed to be everything that
      is unjust and ignominious.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Sir Horace Upton's fortune to have fallen into one of these
      embarrassments. He had advised the Home Government to take some measures,
      or at least look with favor on certain movements of the Poles in Russia,
      in order the better to obtain some concessions then required from the
      Cabinet of the Czar. The Premier did not approve of the suggestion, nor
      was it like to meet acceptance at home. We were in a pro-Russian fever at
      the moment. Some mob disturbances at Norwich, a Chartist meeting at
      Stockport, and something else in Wales, had frightened the nation into a
      hot stage of conservatism; and never was there such an ill-chosen moment
      to succor Poles or awaken dormant nationalities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upton's proposal was rejected. He was even visited with one of those
      disagreeable acknowledgments by which the Foreign Office reminds a
      speculative minister that he is going <i>ultra crepidam</i>. When an envoy
      is snubbed, he always asks for leave of absence. If the castigation be
      severe, he invariably, on his return to England, goes to visit the Leader
      of the Opposition. This is the ritual. Sir Horace, however, only observed
      it in half. He came home; but after his first morning's attendance at the
      Foreign Office, he disappeared; none saw or heard of him. He knew well all
      the value of mystery, and he accordingly disappeared from public view
      altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, therefore, Harcourt's letter reached him, proposing that he should
      visit Glencore, the project came most opportunely; and that he only
      accepted it for a day, was in the spirit of his habitual diplomacy, since
      he then gave himself all the power of an immediate departure, or permitted
      the option of remaining gracefully, in defiance of all pre-engage-ments,
      and all plans to be elsewhere. We have been driven, for the sake of this
      small fact, to go a great way round in our history; but we promise our
      readers that Sir Horace was one of those people whose motives are never
      tracked without a considerable <i>détour</i>. The reader knows now why he
      was at Glencore,&mdash;he already knew how.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terrible interview with Glencore brought back a second relapse of
      greater violence than the first, and it was nigh a fortnight ere he was
      pronounced out of danger. It was a strange life that Harcourt and Upton
      led in that dreary interval. Guests of one whose life was in utmost peril,
      they met in that old gallery each day to talk, in half-whispered
      sentences, over the sick man's case, and his chances of recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harcourt frankly told Upton that the first relapse was the consequence of
      a scene between Glencore and himself. Upton made no similar confession. He
      reflected deeply, however, over all that had passed, and came to the
      conclusion that, in Glencore's present condition, opposition might
      prejudice his chance of recovery, but never avail to turn him from his
      project. He also set himself to study the boy's character, and found it,
      in all respects, the very type of his father's. Great bashfulness, united
      to great boldness, timidity, and distrust, were there side by side with a
      rash, impetuous nature that would hesitate at nothing in pursuit of an
      object. Pride, however, was the great principle of his being,&mdash;the
      good and evil motive of all that was in him. He had pride on every
      subject. His name, his rank, his station, a consciousness of natural
      quickness, a sense of aptitude to learn whatever came before him,&mdash;all
      gave him the same feeling of pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a deal of good in that lad," said Harcourt to Upton, one evening,
      as the boy had left the room; "I like his strong affection for his father,
      and that unbounded faith he seems to have in Glencore's being better than
      every one else in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is an excellent religion, my dear Harcourt, if it could only last!"
      said the diplomat, smiling amiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why should n't it last?" asked the other, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just because nothing lasts that has its origin in ignorance. The boy has
      seen nothing of life, has had no opportunity for forming a judgment or
      instituting a comparison between any two objects. The first shot that
      breaches that same fortress of belief, down will come the whole edifice!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 'd give a lad to the Jesuits, then, to be trained up in every
      artifice and distrust?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Far from it, Harcourt. I think their system a mistake all through. The
      science of life must be self-learned, and it is a slow acquisition. All
      that education can do is to prepare the mind to receive it. Now, to employ
      the first years of a boy's life by storing him with prejudices, is just to
      encumber a vessel with a rotten cargo that she must throw overboard before
      she can load with a profitable freight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is it in that category you'd class his love for his father?" asked
      the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not; but any unnatural or exaggerated estimate of him is a
      great error, to lead to an equally unfair depreciation when the time of
      deception is past. To be plain, Harcourt, is that boy fitted to enter one
      of our great public schools, stand the hard, rough usage of his own
      equals, and buffet it as you or I have done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? or, at least, why should n't he become so after a month or two?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just because in that same month or two he'd either die broken-hearted, or
      plunge his knife into the heart of some comrade who insulted him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit of it. You don't know him at all. Charley is a fine
      give-and-take fellow; a little proud, perhaps, because he lives apart from
      all that are his equals. Let Glencore just take courage to send him to
      Harrow or Rugby, and my life on it, but he 'll be the manliest fellow in
      the school."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll undertake, without Harrow or Rugby, that the boy should become
      something even greater than that," said Upton, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I know you sneer at my ideas of what a young fellow ought to be,"
      said Harcourt; "but, somehow, you did not neglect these same pursuits
      yourself. You can shoot as well as most men, and you ride better than any
      I know of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One likes to do a little of everything, Harcourt," said Upton, not at all
      displeased at this flattery; "and somehow it never suits a fellow, who
      really feels that he has fair abilities, to do anything badly; so that it
      comes to this: one does it well, or not at all. Now, you never heard me
      touch the piano?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just because I'm only an inferior performer, and so I only play when
      perfectly alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Egad, if I could only master a waltz, or one of the melodies, I'd be at
      it whenever any one would listen to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a good soul, and full of amiability, Harcourt," said Upton; but
      the words sounded very much as though he said, "You're a dear, good,
      sensible creature, without an atom of self-respect or esteem."
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, so conscious was Harcourt that the expression meant no compliment
      that he actually reddened and looked away. At last he took courage to
      renew the conversation, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what would you advise for the boy, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'd scarcely lay down a system; but I 'll tell you what I would not do.
      I 'd not bore him with mathematics; I 'd not put his mind on the stretch
      in any direction; I 'd not stifle the development of any taste that may be
      struggling within him, but rather encourage and foster it, since it is
      precisely by such an indication you 'll get some clew to his nature. Do
      you understand me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm not quite sure I do; but I believe you'd leave him to something like
      utter idleness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What to <i>you</i>, my dear Harcourt, would be utter idleness, I've no
      doubt; but not to him, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the Colonel looked mortified, but evidently knew not how to resent
      this new sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said he, after a pause, "the lad will not require to be a genius."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the better for him, probably; at all events, so much the better
      for his friends, and all who are to associate with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he looked fixedly at Upton, who smiled a most courteous acquiescence
      in the opinion,&mdash;a politeness that made poor Harcourt perfectly
      ashamed of his own rudeness, and he continued hurriedly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll have abundance of money. The life Glencore leads here will be like
      a long minority to him. A fine old name and title, and the deuce is in it
      if he can't rub through life pleasantly enough with such odds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you are right, after all, Harcourt," said Upton, sighing, and
      now speaking in a far more natural tone; "it <i>is</i> 'rubbing through'
      with the best of us, and no more!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you mean that the process is a very irksome one, I enter my dissent at
      once," broke in Harcourt. "I 'm not ashamed to own that I like life
      prodigiously; and if I be spared to say so, I 'm sure I 'll have the same
      story to tell fifteen or twenty years hence; and yet I 'm not a genius!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Upton, smiling a bland assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor a philosopher either," said Harcourt, irritated at the
      acknowledgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," chimed in Upton, with another smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor have I any wish to be one or the other," rejoined Harcourt, now
      really provoked. "I know right well that if I were in trouble or
      difficulty to-morrow,&mdash;if I wanted a friend to help me with a loan of
      some thousand pounds,&mdash;it is not to a genius or a philosopher I 'd
      look for the assistance."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is ever a chance shot that explodes a magazine, and so is it that a
      random speech is sure to hit the mark that has escaped all the efforts of
      skilful direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upton winced and grew pale at these last words, and he fixed his
      penetrating gray eyes upon the speaker with a keenness all his own.
      Harcourt, however, bore the look without the slightest touch of
      uneasiness. The honest Colonel had spoken without any hidden meaning, nor
      had he the slightest intention of a personal application in his words. Of
      this fact Upton appeared soon to be convinced, for his features gradually
      recovered their wonted calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How perfectly right you are, my dear Harcourt," said he, mildly. "The man
      who expects to be happier by the possession of genius is like one who
      would like to warm himself through a burning-glass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Egad, that is a great consolation for us slow fellows," said Harcourt,
      laughing; "and now what say you to a game at <i>écarté</i>; for I believe
      it is just the one solitary thing I am more than your match in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I accept inferiority in a great many others," said Upton, blandly; "but I
      must decline the challenge, for I have a letter to write, and our post
      here starts at daybreak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'd rather carry the whole bag than indite one of its contents,"
      said the Colonel, rising; and, with a hearty shake of the hand, he left
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A letter was fortunately not so great an infliction to Upton, who opened
      his desk at once, and with a rapid hand traced the following lines:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mv dear Princess,&mdash;My last will have told you how and when I came
      here; I wish I but knew in what way to explain why I still remain! Imagine
      the dreariest desolation of Calabria in a climate of fog and sea-drift:
      sunless skies, leafless trees, impassable roads, the out-door comforts;
      the joys within depending on a gloomy old house, with a few gloomier
      inmates, and a host on a sick bed. Yet, with all this, I believe I am
      better; the doctor, a strange, unsophisticated creature, a cross between
      Galen and Caliban, seems to have hit off what the great dons of science
      never could detect,&mdash;the true seat of my malady. He says&mdash;and he
      really reasons out his case ingeniously&mdash;that the brain has been
      working for the inferior nerves, not limiting itself to cerebral
      functions, but actually performing the humbler office of muscular
      direction, and so forth; in fact, a field-marshal doing duty for a common
      soldier! I almost fancy I can corroborate his view, from internal
      sensations; I have a kind of secret instinct that he is right. Poor brain!
      why it should do the work of another department, with abundance of
      occupation of its own, I cannot make out. But to turn to something else.
      This is not a bad refuge just now. They cannot make out where I am, and
      all the inquiries at my club are answered by a vague impression that I
      have gone back to Germany, which the people at F. O. are aware is not the
      case. I have already told you that my suggestion has been negatived in the
      Cabinet: it was ill-timed, Allington says; but I ventured to remind his
      Lordship that a policy requiring years to develop, and more years still to
      push to a profitable conclusion, is not to be reduced to the category of
      mere <i>à propos</i> measures. He was vexed, and replied weakly and
      angrily. I rejoined, and left him. Next day he sent for me, but my reply
      was, "I was leaving town;" and I left. I don't want the Bath, because it
      would be "ill-timed;" so that they must give me Vienna, or be satisfied to
      see me in the House and the Opposition!
    </p>
    <p>
      Your tidings of Brekenoff came exactly in the nick. Allington said
      pompously that they were sure of him; so I just said, "Ask him if they
      would like our sending a Consular Agent to Cracow?" It seems that he was
      so flurried by a fancied detection that he made a full acknowledgment of
      all. But even at this, Allington takes no alarm. The malady of the
      Treasury benches is deafness, with a touch of blindness. What a cumbrous
      piece of bungling machinery is this boasted "representative government" of
      ours! No promptitude, no secrecy! Everything debated, and discussed, and
      discouraged, before begun; every blot-hit for an antagonist to profit by!
      Even the characters of our public men exposed, and their weaknesses
      displayed to view, so that every state of Europe may see where to wound
      us, and through whom! There is no use in the Countess remaining here any
      longer; the King never noticed her at the last ball; she is angry at it,
      and if she shows her irritation she 'll spoil all. I always thought
      Josephine would fail in England. It is, indeed, a widely different thing
      to succeed in the small Courts of Germany, and our great whirlpool of St.
      James. <i>You</i> could do it, my dear friend; but where is the other dare
      attempt it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Until I hear from you again I can come to no resolution. One thing is
      clear,&mdash;they do not, or they will not, see the danger I have pointed
      out to them. All the home policy of our country is drifting, day by day,
      towards a democracy: how, in the name of common sense, then, is our
      foreign policy to be maintained at the standard of the Holy Alliance? What
      an absurd juxtaposition is there between popular rights and an alliance
      with the Czar! This peril will overtake them one day or another, and then,
      to escape from national indignation, the minister, whoever he may be, will
      be driven to make war. But I can't wait for this; and yet, were I to
      resign, my resignation would not embarrass them,&mdash;it would irritate
      and annoy, but not disconcert. Brekenoff will surely go home on leave. You
      ought to meet him; he is certain to be at Ems. It is the refuge of
      disgraced diplomacy. Try if something cannot be done with him. He used to
      say formerly yours were the only dinners now in Europe. He hates
      Allington. This feeling, and his love for white truffles, are, I believe,
      the only clews to the man. Be sure, however, that the truffles are
      Piedmontese; they have a slight flavor of garlic, rather agreeable than
      otherwise. Like Josephine's lisp, it is a defect that serves for a
      distinction. The article in the "Beau Monde" was clever, prettily written,
      and even well worked out; but state affairs are never really well treated
      save by those who conduct them. One must have played the game himself to
      understand all the nice subtleties of the contest. These, your mere
      reviewer or newspaper scribe never attains to; and then he has no
      reserves,&mdash;none of those mysterious concealments that are to
      negotiations like the eloquent pauses of conversation: the moment when
      dialogue ceases, and the real interchange of ideas begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fine touch, the keen <i>aperçu</i>, belongs alone to those who have
      had to exercise these same qualities in the treatment of great questions;
      and hence it is that though the Public be often much struck, and even
      enlightened, by the powerful "article" or the able "leader," the Statesman
      is rarely taught anything by the journalist, save the force and direction
      of public opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a deal to say to you about poor Glencore, whom you tell me you
      remember; but, how to say it? He is broken-hearted&mdash;literally
      broken-hearted&mdash;by her desertion of him. It was one of those
      ill-assorted leagues which cannot hold together. Why they did not see
      this, and make the best of it,&mdash;sensibly, dispassionately, even
      amicably,&mdash;it is difficult to say. An Englishman, it would seem, must
      always hate his wife if she cannot love him; and, after all, how
      involuntary are all affections, and what a severe penalty is this for an
      unwitting offence!
    </p>
    <p>
      He ponders over this calamity just as if it were the crushing stroke by
      which a man's whole career was to be finished forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stupidity of all stupidities is in these cases to fly from the world
      and avoid society. By doing this a man rears a barrier he never can
      repass; he proclaims aloud his sentiment of the injury, quite forgetting
      all the offence he is giving to the hundred and fifty others who, in the
      same predicament as himself, are by no means disposed to turn hermits on
      account of it. Men make revolutionary governments, smash dynasties,
      transgress laws, but they cannot oppose <i>convenances!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I need scarcely say that there is nothing to be gained by reason-ing with
      him. He has worked himself up to a chronic fury, and talks of vengeance
      all day long, like a Corsican. For company here I have an old brother
      officer of my days of tinsel and pipe-clay,&mdash;an excellent creature,
      whom I amuse myself by tormenting. There is also Glencore's boy,&mdash;a
      strange, dreamy kind of haughty fellow, an exaggeration of his father in
      disposition, but with good abilities. These are not the elements of much
      social agreeability; but you know, dear friend, how little I stand in need
      of what is called company. Your last letter, charming as it was, has
      afforded me all the companionship I could desire. I have re-read it till I
      know it by heart. I could almost chide you for that delightful little
      party in my absence, but of course it was, as all you ever do is,
      perfectly right; and, after all, I am, perhaps, not sorry that you had
      those people when I was away, so that we shall be more <i>chez nous</i>
      when we meet. But when is that to be? Who can tell? My medico insists upon
      five full weeks for my cure. Allington is very likely, in his present
      temper, to order me back to my post. You seem to think that you must be in
      Berlin when Seckendorf arrives, so that&mdash;But I will not darken the
      future by gloomy forebodings. I <i>could</i> leave this&mdash;that is, if
      any urgency required it&mdash;at once; but, if possible, it is better I
      should remain at least a little longer. My last meeting with Glencore was
      unpleasant. Poor fellow! his temper is not what it used to be, and he is
      forgetful of what is due to one whose nerves are in the sad state of mine.
      You shall hear all my complainings when we meet, dear Princess; and with
      this I kiss your hand, begging you to accept all "<i>mes hommages" et mon
      estime</i>,
    </p>
    <p>
      H. U.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your letter must be addressed "Leenane, Ireland." Your last had only
      "Glencore" on it, and not very legible either, so that it made what I
      wished <i>I</i> could do, "the tour of Scotland," before reaching me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Horace read over his letter carefully, as though it had been a
      despatch, and, when he had done, folded it up with an air of satisfaction.
      He had said nothing that he wished unsaid, and he had mentioned a little
      about everything he desired to touch upon. He then took his "drops" from a
      queer-looking little phial he carried about with him, and having looked at
      his face in a pocket-glass, he half closed his eyes in revery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange, confused visions were they that flitted through his brain.
      Thoughts of ambition the most daring, fancies about health, speculations
      in politics, finance, religion, literature, the arts, society,&mdash;all
      came and went. Plans and projects jostled each other at every instant. Now
      his brow would darken, and his thin lips close tightly, as some painful
      impression crossed him; now again a smile, a slight laugh even, betrayed
      the passing of some amusing conception. It was easy to see how such a
      nature could suffice to itself, and how little he needed of that
      give-and-take which companionship supplies. He could&mdash;to steal a
      figure from our steam language&mdash;he could "bank his fires," and await
      any emergency, and, while scarcely consuming any fuel, prepare for the
      most trying demand upon his powers. A hasty movement of feet overhead, and
      the sound of voices talking loudly, aroused him from his reflections,
      while a servant entered abruptly to say that Lord Glencore wished to see
      him immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is his Lordship worse?" asked Upton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir; but he was very angry with the young lord this evening about
      something, and they say that with the passion he opened the bandage on his
      head, and set the vein a-bleed-ing again. Billy Traynor is there now
      trying to stop it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go upstairs," said Sir Horace, rising, and beginning to fortify
      himself with caps, and capes, and comforters,&mdash;precautions that he
      never omitted when moving from one room to the other.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. A NIGHT AT SEA
    </h2>
    <p>
      Glencore's chamber presented a scene of confusion and dismay as Upton
      entered. The sick man had torn off the bandage from his temples, and so
      roughly as to reopen the half-closed artery, and renew the bleeding. Not
      alone the bedclothes and the curtains, but the faces of the attendants
      around him, were stained with blood, which seemed the more ghastly from
      contrast with their pallid cheeks. They moved hurriedly to and fro,
      scarcely remembering what they were in search of, and evidently deeming
      his state of the greatest peril. Traynor, the only one whose faculties
      were unshaken by the shock, sat quietly beside the bed, his fingers firmly
      compressed upon the orifice of the vessel, while with the other hand he
      motioned to them to keep silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore lay with closed eyes, breathing long and labored inspirations,
      and at times convulsed by a slight shivering. His face, and even his lips,
      were bloodless, and his eyelids of a pale, livid hue. So terribly like the
      approach of death was his whole appearance that Upton whispered in the
      doctor's ear,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it over? Is he dying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Upton," said Glencore; for, with the acute hearing of intense
      nervousness, he had caught the words. "It is not so easy to die."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, now,&mdash;no more talkin',&mdash;no discoorsin'&mdash;azy and
      quiet is now the word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bind it up and leave me,&mdash;leave me with <i>him</i>;" and Glencore
      pointed to Upton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dar' n't move out of this spot," said Billy, addressing Upton. "You'd
      have the blood coming out, <i>per saltim</i>, if I took away my finger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be patient, Glencore," said Upton, gently; "you know I'm always
      ready when you want me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you'll not leave this,&mdash;you'll not desert me?" cried the other,
      eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not; I have no thought of going away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, now, hould your prate, both of ye, or, by my conscience, I 'll not
      take the responsibility upon me,&mdash;I will not!" said Billy, angrily.
      "'Tis just a disgrace and a shame that ye haven't more discretion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore's lips moved with a feeble attempt at a smile, and in his faint
      voice he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must obey the doctor, Upton; but don't leave me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upton moved a chair to the bedside, and sat down without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye think an artery is like a canal, with a lock-gate to it, I believe,"
      said Billy, in a low, grumbling voice, to Upton, "and you forget all its
      vermicular motion, as ould Fabricius called it, and that it is only by a
      coagalum, a kind of barrier, like a mud breakwater, that it can be
      plugged. Be off out of that, ye spalpeens! be off, every one of yez, and
      leave us tranquil and paceable!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This summary command was directed to the various servants, who were still
      moving about the room in imaginary occupation. The room was at last
      cleared of all save Upton and Billy, who sat by the bedside, his hand
      still resting on the sick man's forehead. Soothed by the stillness, and
      reduced by the loss of blood, Glencore sank into a quiet sleep, breathing
      softly and gently as a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at him now," whispered Billy to Upton, "and you 'll see what
      philosophy there is in ascribin' to the heart the source of all our
      emotions. He lies there azy and comfortable just because the great bellows
      is working smoothly and quietly. They talk about the brain, and the spinal
      nerves, and the soliar plexus; but give a man a wake, washy circulation,
      and what is he? He's just like a chap with the finest intentions in the
      world, but not a sixpence in his pocket to carry them out! A fine
      well-regulated, steady-batin' heart is like a credit on the bank,&mdash;you
      draw on it, and your draft is n't dishonored!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was it brought on this attack?" asked Upton, in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A shindy he had with the boy. I was n't here; there was nobody by. But
      when I met Master Charles on the stairs, he flew past me like lightning,
      and I just saw by a glimpse that something was wrong. He rushed out with
      his head bare, and his coat all open, and it sleetin' terribly! Down he
      went towards the lough, at full speed, and never minded all my callin'
      after him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he returned?" asked Upton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not as I know, sir. We were too much taken up with the lord to ask for
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll just step down and see," said Sir Horace, who arose, and left the
      room on tiptoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Upton's inquiry all made the same answer. None had seen the young lord,&mdash;none
      could give any clew as to whither he had gone. Sir Horace at once hastened
      to Harcourt's room, and, after some vigorous shakes, succeeded in
      awakening the Colonel, and by dint of various repetitions at last put him
      in possession of all that had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must look after the lad," cried Harcourt, springing from his bed, and
      dressing with all haste. "He is a rash, hot-headed fellow; but even if it
      were nothing else, he might get his death in such a night as this."
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind dashed wildly against the window-panes as he spoke, and the old
      timbers of the frame rattled fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you remain here, Upton. I'll go in search of the boy. Take care
      Glencore hears nothing of his absence." And with a promptitude that
      bespoke the man of action, Harcourt descended the stairs and set out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was pitch dark; sweeping gusts of wind bore the rain along in
      torrents, and the thunder rolled incessantly, its clamor increased by the
      loud beating of the waves as they broke upon the rocks. Upton had repeated
      to Harcourt that Billy saw the boy going towards the sea-shore, and in
      this direction he now followed. His frequent excursions had familiarized
      him with the place, so that even at night Harcourt found no difficulty in
      detecting the path and keeping it. About half an hour's brisk walking
      brought him to the side of the lough, and the narrow flight of steps cut
      in the rock, which descended to the little boat-quay. Here he halted, and
      called out the boy's name several times. The sea, however, was running
      mountains high, and an immense drift, sweeping over the rocks, fell in
      sheets of scattered foam beyond them; so that Harcourt's voice was drowned
      by the uproar. A small shealing under the shelter of the rock formed the
      home of a boatman; and at the crazy door of this humble cot Harcourt now
      knocked violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man answered the summons at once, assuring him that he had not heard
      or seen any one since the night closed in; adding, at the same time, that
      in such a tempest a boat's crew might have landed without his knowing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure," continued he, after a pause, "I heard a chain rattlin' on
      the rock soon after I went to bed, and I 'll Just step down and see if the
      yawl is all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had he left the spot, when his voice was heard calling out from
      below,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's gonel the yawl is gone! the lock is broke with a stone, and she's
      away!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could this be? No boat could live in such a sea," cried Harcourt,
      eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She could go out fast enough, sir. The wind is northeast, due; but how
      long she'll keep the say is another matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then he 'll be lost!" cried Harcourt, wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, sir,&mdash;who is it?" asked the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your master's son!" cried he, wringing his hands in anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, murther! murther!" screamed the boatman; "we 'll never see him again.
      'T is out to say, into the wild ocean, he'll be blown!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there no shelter,&mdash;no spot he could make for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Barrin' the islands, there's not a spot between this and America."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he could make the islands,&mdash;you are sure of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the boat was able to live through the say. But sure I know him well;
      he 'll never take in a reef or sail, but sit there, with the helm hard up,
      just never carin' what came of him! Oh, musha! musha! what druv him out
      such a night as this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, it's no time for lamenting, my man; get the launch ready, and let
      us follow him. Are you afraid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid!" replied the man, with a touch of scorn in his voice; "faix, it's
      little fear troubles me. But, may be, you won't like to be in her yourself
      when she's once out. I 've none belongin' to me,&mdash;father, mother,
      chick or child; but you may have many a one that's near to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My ties, are, perhaps, as light as your own," said Harcourt. "Come, now,
      be alive. I'll put ten gold guineas in your hand if you can overtake him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd rather see his face than have two hundred," said the man, as,
      springing into the boat, he began to haul out the tackle from under the
      low half-deck, and prepare for sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is your honor used to a boat, or ought I to get another man with me?"
      asked the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trust me, my good fellow; I have had more sailing than yourself, and in
      more treacherous seas too," said Harcourt, who, throwing off his cloak,
      proceeded to help the other, with an address that bespoke a practised
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind blew strongly off the shore, so that scarcely was the foresail
      spread than the boat began to move rapidly through the water, dashing the
      sea over her bows, and plunging wildly through the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me a hand now with the halyard," said the boatman; "and when the
      mainsail is set, you 'll see how she 'll dance over the top of the waves,
      and never wet us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She 's too light in the water, if anything," said Harcourt, as the boat
      bounded buoyantly under the increased press of canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your honor's right; she'd do better with half a ton of iron in her. Stand
      by, sir, always, with the peak halyards; get the sail aloft in, when I
      give you the word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave the tiller to me, my man," said Harcourt, taking it as he spoke.
      "You 'll soon see that I 'm no new hand at the work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's doing it well," said the man. "Keep her up! keep her up! there's a
      spit of land runs out here; in a few minutes more we'll have say room
      enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      The heavier roll of the waves, and the increased force of the wind, soon
      showed that they had gained the open sea; while the atmosphere, relieved
      of the dark shadows of the mountain, seemed lighter and thinner than in
      shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We 're to make for the islands, you say, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. What distance are they off?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About eighteen miles. Two hours, if the wind lasts, and we can bear it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And could the yawl stand this?" said Harcourt, as a heavy sea struck the
      bow, and came in a cataract over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better than ourselves, if she was manned. Luff! luff!&mdash;that's it!"
      And as the boat turned up to wind, sheets of spray and foam flew over her.
      "Master Charles hasn't his equal for steerin', if he wasn't alone. Keep
      her there!&mdash;now! steady, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's a squall coming," cried Harcourt; "I hear it hissing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Down went the peak, but scarcely in time, for the wind, catching the sail,
      laid the boat gunwale under. After a struggle, she righted, but with
      nearly one-third of her filled with water.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd take in a reef, or two reefs," said the man; "but if she could n't
      rise to the say, she 'll fill and go down. We must carry on, at all
      events."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So say I. It's no time to shorten sail, with such a sea running."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat now flew through the water, the sea itself impelling her, as with
      every sudden gust the waves struck the stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's a brave craft," said Harcourt, as she rose lightly over the great
      waves, and plunged down again into the trough of the sea; "but if we ever
      get to land again, I'll have combings round her to keep her dryer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here it comes!&mdash;here it comes, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor were the words well out, when, like a thunder-clap, the wind struck
      the sail, and bent the mast over like a whip. For an instant it seemed as
      if she were going down by the prow; but she righted again, and, shivering
      in every plank, held on her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That 's as much as she could do," said the sailor; "and I would not like
      to ax her to do more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I agree with you," said Harcourt, secretly stealing his feet back again
      into his shoes, which he had just kicked off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's freshening it is every minute," said the man; "and I'm not sure that
      we could make the islands if it lasts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well,&mdash;what then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's nothing for it but to be blown out to say," said he, calmly, as,
      having filled his tobacco-pipe, he struck a light and began to smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very thing I was wishing for," said Harcourt, touching his cigar to
      the bright ashes. "How she labors! Do you think she can stand this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She can, if it's no worse, sir." "But it looks heavier weather outside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As well as I can see, it's only beginnin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harcourt listened with a species of admiration to the calm and measured
      sentiment of the sailor, who, fully conscious of all the danger, yet
      never, by a word or gesture, showed that he was flurried or excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been out on nights as bad as this, I suppose?" said Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe not quite, sir, for it's a great say is runnin'; and, with the wind
      off shore, we could n't have this, if there was n't a storm blowing
      farther out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the westward, you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir,&mdash;a wind coming over the whole ocean, that will soon meet
      the land wind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And does that often happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were but out, when, with a loud report like a cannon-shot, the
      wind reversed the sail, snapping the strong sprit in two, and bringing
      down the whole canvas clattering into the boat. With the aid of a hatchet,
      the sailor struck off the broken portion of the spar, and soon cleared the
      wreck, while the boat, now reduced to a mere foresail, labored heavily,
      sinking her prow in the sea at every bound. Her course, too, was now
      altered, and she flew along parallel to the shore, the great cliffs
      looming through the darkness, and seeming as if close to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The boy!&mdash;the boy!" cried Harcourt; "what has become of him? He
      never could have lived through that squall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the spar stood, there was an end of us, too," said the sailor; "she'd
      have gone down by the stern, as sure as my name is Peter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is all over by this time," muttered Harcourt, sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pace to him now!" said the sailor, as he crossed himself, and went over a
      prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind now raged fearfully; claps, like the report of cannon, struck the
      frail boat at intervals, and laid her nearly keel uppermost; while the
      mast bent like a whip, and every rope creaked and strained to its last
      endurance. The deafening noise close at hand told where the waves were
      beating on the rock-bound coast, or surging with the deep growl of thunder
      through many a cavern. They rarely spoke, save when some emergency called
      for a word. Each sat wrapped up in his own dark reveries, and unwilling to
      break them. Hours passed thus,&mdash;long, dreary hours of darkness, that
      seemed like years of suffering, so often in this interval did life hang in
      the balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As morning began to break with a grayish blue light to the westward, the
      wind slightly abated, blowing more steadily, too, and less in sudden
      gusts; while the sea rolled in large round waves, unbroken above, and
      showing no crest of foam.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know where we are?" asked Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; we 're off the Rooks' Point, and if we hold on well, we 'll
      soon be in slacker water."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could the boy have reached this, think you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man shook his head mournfully, without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How far are we from Glencore?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About eighteen miles, sir; but more by land."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can put me ashore, then, somewhere hereabouts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, in the next bay; there's a creek we can easily run into."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite sure he couldn't have been blown out to sea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could he, sir? There's only one way the wind could dhrive him. If he
      isn't in the Clough Bay, he's in glory."
    </p>
    <p>
      All the anxiety of that dreary night was nothing to what Harcourt now
      suffered, in his eagerness to round the Rooks' Point, and look in the bay
      beyond it. Controlling it as he would, still would it break out in words
      of impatience and even anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't curse the boat, yer honor," said Peter, respectfully, but calmly;
      "she's behaved well to us this night, or we 'd not be here now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But are we to beat about here forever?" asked the other, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's doin' well, and we ought to be thankful," said the man; and his
      tone, even more than his words, served to reprove the other's impatience.
      "I'll try and set the mainsail on her with the remains of the sprit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harcourt watched him, as he labored away to repair the damaged rigging;
      but though he looked at him, his thoughts were far away with poor Glencore
      upon his sick bed, in sorrow and in suffering, and perhaps soon to hear
      that he was childless. From these he went on to other thoughts. What could
      have occurred to have driven the boy to such an act of desperation?
      Harcourt invented a hundred imaginary causes, to reject them as rapidly
      again. The affection the boy bore to his father seemed the strongest
      principle of his nature. There appeared to be no event possible in which
      that feeling would not sway and control him. As he thus ruminated, he was
      aroused by the sudden cry of the boatman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a boat, sir, dismasted, ahead of us, and drifting out to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see her!&mdash;I see her!" cried Harcourt; "out with the oars, and
      let's pull for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavily as the sea was rolling, they now began to pull through the immense
      waves, Harcourt turning his head at every instant to watch the boat, which
      now was scarcely half a mile ahead of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's empty!&mdash;there's no one in her!" said Peter, mournfully, as,
      steadying himself by the mast, he cast a look seaward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Row on,&mdash;let us get beside her," said Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's the yawl!&mdash;I know her now," cried the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And empty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Washed out of her with a say, belike," said Peter, resuming his oar, and
      tugging with all his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour's hard rowing brought them close to the dismasted
      boat, which, drifting broadside on the sea, seemed at every instant ready
      to capsize.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's something in the bottom,&mdash;in the stern-sheets!" screamed
      Peter. "It's himself! O blessed Virgin, it's himself!" And, with a bound,
      he sprang from his own boat into the other.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      The next instant he had lifted the helpless body of the boy from the
      bottom of the boat, and, with a shout of joy, screamed out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's alive!&mdash;he's well!&mdash;it's only fatigue!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harcourt pressed his hands to his face, and sank upon his knees in prayer.

      CHAPTER XIII. A "VOW" ACCOMPLISHED
    </h2>
    <p>
      Just as Upton had seated himself at that fragal meal of weak tea and dry
      toast he called his breakfast, Harcourt suddenly entered the room,
      splashed and road-stained from head to foot, and in his whole demeanor
      indicating the work of a fatiguing journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I thought to have had my breakfast with you," cried he, impatiently,
      "and this is like the diet of a convalescent from fever. Where is the
      salmon&mdash;where the grouse pie&mdash;where are the cutlets&mdash;and
      the chocolate&mdash;and the poached eggs&mdash;and the hot rolls, and the
      cherry bounce?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, rather, where are the disordered livers, worn-out stomachs, fevered
      brains, and impatient tempers, my worthy Colonel?" said Upton, blandly.
      "Talleyrand himself once told me that he always treated great questions
      starving."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he made a nice mess of the world in consequence," blustered out
      Harcourt. "A fellow with an honest appetite and a sound digestion would
      never have played false to so many masters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is quite right that men like you should read history in this wise,"
      said Upton, smiling, as he dipped a crust in his tea and ate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Men like me are very inferior creatures, no doubt," broke in Harcourt,
      angrily; "but I very much doubt if men like you had come eighteen miles on
      foot over a mountain this morning, after a night passed in an open boat at
      sea,&mdash;ay, in a gale, by Jove, such as I sha' n't forget in a hurry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have hit it perfectly, Harcourt; <i>suum caique</i>; and if only we
      could get the world to see that each of us has his speciality, we should
      all of us do much better."
    </p>
    <p>
      By the vigorous tug he gave the bell, and the tone in which he ordered up
      something to eat, it was plain to see that he scarcely relished the moral
      Upton had applied to his speech. With the appearance of the good cheer,
      however, he speedily threw off his momentary displeasure, and as he ate
      and drank, his honest, manly face lost every trace of annoyance. Once only
      did a passing shade of anger cross his countenance. It was when, suddenly
      looking up, he saw Upton's eyes settled on him, and his whole features
      expressing a most palpable sensation of wonderment and compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," cried he, "I know well what's passing in your mind this minute. You
      are lost in your pitying estimate of such a mere animal as I am; but, hang
      it all, old fellow, why not be satisfied with the flattering thought that
      <i>you</i> are of another stamp,&mdash;a creature of a different order?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does not make one a whit happier," sighed Upton, who never shrunk from
      accepting the sentiment as his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should have thought otherwise," said Harcourt, with a malicious twinkle
      of the eye; for he fancied that he had at last touched the weak point of
      his adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear Harcourt, the <i>crasso naturo</i> have rather the best of
      it, since no small share of this world's collisions are actually physical
      shocks; and that great strong pipkin that encloses your brains will stand
      much that would smash the poor egg-shell that shrouds mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whenever you draw a comparison in my favor, I always find at the end I
      come off worst," said Harcourt, bluntly; and Upton laughed one of his
      rich, musical laughs, in which there was indeed nothing mirthful, but
      something that seemed to say that his nature experienced a sense of
      enjoyment higher, perhaps, than anything merely comic could suggest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You came off best this time, Harcourt," said he, good-humoredly; and such
      a thorough air of frankness accompanied the words that Harcourt was
      disarmed of all distrust at once, and joined in the laugh heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you have not yet told me, Harcourt," said the other, "where you have
      been, and why you spent your night on the sea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The story is not a very long one," replied he; and at once gave a full
      recital of the events, which our reader has already had before him in our
      last chapter, adding, in conclusion,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have left the boy in a cabin at Belmullet; he is in a high fever, and
      raving so loud that you could hear him a hundred yards away. I told them
      to keep cold water on his head, and give him plenty of it to drink,&mdash;nothing
      more,&mdash;till I could fetch our doctor over, for it will be impossible
      to move the boy from where he is for the present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glencore has been asking for him already this morning. He did not desire
      to see him, but he begged of me to go to him and speak with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And have you told him that he was from home,&mdash;that he passed the
      night away from this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I merely intimated that I should look after him, waiting for your
      return to guide myself afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't suspect that when we took him from the boat the malady had set
      in; he appeared rather like one overcome by cold and exhaustion. It was
      about two hours after,&mdash;he had taken some food and seemed stronger,&mdash;when
      I said to him, 'Come, Charley, you 'll soon be all right again; I have
      sent a fellow to look after a pony for you, and you 'll be able to ride
      back, won't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ride where?' cried he, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Home, of course,' said I, 'to Glencore.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Home! I have no home,' cried he; and the wild scream he uttered the
      words with, I 'll never forget. It was just as if that one thought was the
      boundary between sense and reason, and the instant he had passed it, all
      was chaos and confusion; for now his raving began,&mdash;the most frantic
      imaginations; always images of sorrow, and with a rapidity of utterance
      there was no following. Of course in such cases the delusions suggest no
      clew to the cause, but all his fancies were about being driven out of
      doors an outcast and a beggar, and of his father rising from his sick bed
      to curse him. Poor boy! Even in this his better nature gleamed forth as he
      cried, 'Tell him'&mdash;and he said the words in a low whisper&mdash;'tell
      him not to anger himself; he is ill, very ill, and should be kept
      tranquil. Tell him, then, that I am going&mdash;going away forever, and
      he'll hear of me no more.'" As Harcourt repeated the words, his own voice
      faltered, and two heavy drops slowly coursed down his bronzed cheeks. "You
      see," added he, as if to excuse the emotion, "that was n't like raving,
      for he spoke this just as he might have done if his very heart was
      breaking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor fellow!" said Upton; and the words were uttered with real feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some terrible scene must have occurred between them," resumed Harcourt;
      "of that I feel quite certain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suspect you are right," said Upton, bending over his teacup; "and <i>our</i>
      part, in consequence, is one of considerable delicacy; for until Glencore
      alludes to what has passed, <i>we</i> of course, can take no notice of it.
      The boy is ill; he is in a fever: we know nothing more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll leave you to deal with the father; the son shall be my care. I have
      told Traynor to be ready to start with me after breakfast, and have
      ordered two stout ponies for the journey. I conclude there will be no
      objection in detaining the doctor for the night: what think you, Upton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do <i>you</i> consult the doctor on that head; meanwhile, I 'll pay a
      visit to Glencore. I 'll meet you in the library." And so saying, Upton
      rose, and gracefully draping the folds of his dressing-gown, and arranging
      the waving lock of hair which had escaped beneath his cap, he slowly set
      out towards the sick man's chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the springs of human action, there was not one in which Sir Horace
      Upton sympathized so little as passion. That any man could adopt a line of
      conduct from which no other profit could result than what might minister
      to a feeling of hatred, jealousy, or revenge, seemed to him utterly
      contemptible. It was not, indeed, the morality of such a course that he
      called in question, although he would not have contested that point. It
      was its meanness, its folly, its insufficiency. His experience of great
      affairs had imbued him with all the importance that was due to temper and
      moderation. He scarcely remembered an instant where a false move had
      damaged a negotiation that it could not be traced to some passing trait of
      impatience, or some lurking spirit of animosity biding the hour of its
      gratification.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had long learned to perceive how much more temperament has to do, in
      the management of great events, than talent or capacity, and his opinion
      of men was chiefly founded on this quality of their nature. It was, then,
      with an almost pitying estimate of Glenoore that he now entered the room
      where the sick man lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anxious to be alone with him, Glenoore had dismissed all the attendants
      from his room, and sat, propped up by pillows, eagerly awaiting his
      approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upton moved through the dimly lighted room like one familiar to the
      atmosphere of illness, and took his seat beside the bed with that
      noiseless quiet which in <i>him</i> was a kind of instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was several minutes before Glencore spoke, and then, in a low, faint
      voice, he said, "Are we alone, Upton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the other, gently pressing the wasted fingers which lay on the
      counterpane before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forgive me, Upton," said he,&mdash;and the words trembled as he
      uttered them,&mdash;"You forgive me, Upton, though I cannot forgive
      myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear friend, a passing moment of impatience is not to breach the
      friendship of a lifetime. Your calmer judgment would, I know, not be
      unjust to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how am I to repair the wrong I have done you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By never alluding to it,&mdash;never thinking of it again, Glenoore."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is so unworthy, so ignoble in me!" cried Glenoore, bitterly; and a
      tear fell over his eyelid and rested on his wan and worn cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us never think of it, my dear Glenoore. Life has real troubles enough
      for either of us, not to dwell on those which we may fashion out of our
      emotions. I promise you, I have forgotten the whole incident."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glenoore sighed heavily, but did not speak; at last he said, "Be it so,
      Upton," and, covering his face with his hand, lay still and silent.
      "Well," said he, after a long pause, "the die is cast, Upton: I have told
      him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Told the boy?" said Upton.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded an assent. "It is too late to oppose me now, Upton,&mdash;the
      thing is done. I didn't think I had strength for it; but revenge is a
      strong stimulant, and I felt as though once more restored to health, as I
      proceeded. Poor fellow! he bore it like a man. Like a man, do I say? No,
      but better than man ever bore such crushing tidings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He asked me to stop once, while his head reeled, and said, 'In a minute I
      shall be myself again,' and so he was, too; you should have seen him,
      Upton, as he rose to leave me. So much of dignity was there in his look
      that my heart misgave me; and I told him that still, as my son, he should
      never want a friend and a protector. He grew deadly pale, and caught at
      the bed for support. Another moment, and I 'd not have answered for
      myself. I was already relenting; but I thought of <i>her</i>, and my
      resolution came back in all its force. Still, I dared not look on him. The
      sight of that wan cheek, those quivering lips and glassy eyes, would
      certainly have unmanned me. I turned away. When I looked round, he was
      gone!' As he ceased to speak, a clammy perspiration burst forth over his
      face and forehead, and he made a sign to Upton to wet his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the last pang she is to cost me, Upton, but it is a sore one!" said
      he, in a low, hoarse whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Glencore, this is all little short of madness; even as revenge it
      is a failure, since the heaviest share of the penalty recoils upon
      yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so?" cried he, impetuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it thus that an ancient name is to go out forever? Is it in this wise
      that a house noble for centuries is to crumble into ruin? I will not again
      urge upon you the cruel wrong you are doing. Over that boy's inheritance
      you have no more right than over mine,&mdash;you cannot rob him of the
      protection of the law. No power could ever give you the disposal of his
      destiny in this wise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have done it, and I will maintain it, sir," cried Glencore; "and if the
      question is, as you vaguely hint, to be one of law&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, Glencore; do not mistake me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear me out, sir," said he, passionately. "If it is to be one of law, let
      Sir Horace Upton give his testimony,&mdash;tell all that he knows,&mdash;and
      let us see what it will avail him. You may&mdash;it is quite open to you&mdash;place
      us front to front as enemies. You may teach the boy to regard me as one
      who has robbed him of his birthright, and train him up to become my
      accuser in a court of justice. But my cause is a strong one, it cannot be
      shaken; and where you hope to brand <i>me</i> with tyranny, you will but
      visit bastardy upon <i>him</i>. Think twice, then, before you declare this
      combat. It is one where all your craft will not sustain you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Glencore, it is not in this spirit that we can speak profitably
      to each other. If you will not hear my reasons calmly and dispassionately,
      to what end am I here? You have long known me as one who lays claim to no
      more rigid morality than consists with the theory of a worldly man's
      experiences. I affect no high-flown sentiments. I am as plain and
      practical as may be; and when I tell you that you are wrong in this
      affair, I mean to say that what you are about to do is not only bad, but
      impolitic. In your pursuit of a victim, you are immolating yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so; I go not alone to the stake; there is another to partake of the
      torture," cried Glencore, wildly; and already his flushed cheek and
      flashing eyes betrayed the approach of a feverish access.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I am not to have any influence with you, then," resumed Upton, "I am
      here to no purpose. If to all that I say&mdash;to arguments you cannot
      answer&mdash;you obstinately persist in opposing an insane thirst for
      revenge, I see not why you should desire my presence. You have resolved to
      do this great wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is already done, sir," broke in Glencore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wherein, then, can I be of any service to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am coming to that. I had come to it before, had you not interrupted me.
      I want you to be guardian to the boy. I want you to replace me in all that
      regards authority over him. You know life well, Upton. You know it not
      alone in its paths of pleasure and success, but you understand thoroughly
      the rugged footway over which humble men toil wearily to fortune. None can
      better estimate a man's chances of success, nor more surely point the road
      by which he is to attain it. The provision which I destine for him will be
      an humble one, and he will need to rely upon his own efforts. You will not
      refuse me this service, Upton. I ask it in the name of our old
      friendship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is but one objection I could possibly have, and yet that seems to
      be insurmountable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what may it be?" cried Glencore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simply, that in acceding to your request, I make myself an accomplice in
      your plan, and thus aid and abet the very scheme I am repudiating."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What avails your repudiation if it will not turn me from my resolve? That
      it will not, I 'll swear to you as solemnly as ever an oath was taken. I
      tell you again, the thing is done. For the consequences which are to
      follow on it you have no responsibility; these are my concern."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like a little time to think over it," said Upton, with the air
      of one struggling with irresolution. "Let me have this evening to make up
      my mind; to-morrow you shall have my answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so, then," said Glencore; and, turning his face away, waved a cold
      farewell with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not purpose to follow Sir Horace as he retired, nor does our task
      require that we should pry into the secret recesses of his wily nature;
      enough if we say that in asking for time, his purpose was rather to afford
      another opportunity of reflection to Glencore than to give himself more
      space for deliberation. He had found, by the experience of his calling,
      that the delay we often crave for, to resolve a doubt, has sufficed to
      change the mind of him who originated the difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll give him some hours, at least," thought he, "to ponder over what I
      have said. Who knows but the argument may seem better in memory than in
      action? Such things have happened before now." And having finished this
      reflection, he turned to peruse the pamphlet of a quack doctor who pledged
      himself to cure all disorders of the circulation by attending to tidal
      influences, and made the moon herself enter into the <i>materia medica</i>.
      What Sir Horace believed, or did not believe, in the wild rhapsodies of
      the charlatan, is known only to himself. Whether his credulity was fed by
      the hope of obtaining relief, or whether his fancy only was aroused by the
      speculative images thus suggested, it is impossible to say. It is not
      altogether improbable that he perused these things as Charles Fox used to
      read all the trashiest novels of the Minerva Press, and find, in the very
      distorted and exaggerated pictures, a relief and a relaxation which more
      correct views of life had failed to impart. Hard-headed men require
      strange indulgences.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. BILLY TRAYNOR AND THE COLONEL
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a fine breezy morning as the Colonel set out with Billy Traynor for
      Belmullet. The bridle-path by which they travelled led through a wild and
      thinly inhabited tract,&mdash;now dipping down between grassy hills, now
      tracing its course along the cliffs over the sea. Tall ferns covered the
      slopes, protected from the west winds, and here and there little copses of
      stunted oak showed the traces of what once had been forest. It was, on the
      whole, a silent and dreary region, so that the travellers felt it even
      relief as they drew nigh the bright blue sea, and heard the sonorous
      booming of the waves as they broke along the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It cheers one to come up out of those dreary dells, and hear the pleasant
      plash of the sea," said Harcourt; and his bright face showed that he felt
      the enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it does, sir," said Billy. "And yet Homer makes his hero go
      heavy-hearted as he hears the ever-sounding sea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does that signify, Doctor?" said Harcourt, impatiently. "Telling me
      what a character in a fiction feels affects me no more than telling me
      what he does. Why, man, the one is as unreal as the other. The fellow that
      created him fashioned his thoughts as well as his actions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure he did; but when the fellow is a janius, what he makes is as
      much a crayture as either you or myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, Doctor, no mystification."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mean any," broke in Billy. "What I want to say is this, that as
      we read every character to elicit truth,&mdash;truth in the working of
      human motives, truth in passion, truth in all the struggles of our poor
      weak natures,&mdash;why would n't a great janius like Homer, or
      Shakspeare, or Milton, be better able to show us this in some picture
      drawn by themselves, than you or I be able to find it out for ourselves?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harcourt shook his head doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, now," said Billy, returning to the charge, "did you ever see a
      waxwork model of anatomy? Every nerve and siny of a nerve was there,&mdash;not
      a vein nor an artery wanting. The artist that made it all just wanted to
      show you where everything was; but he never wanted you to believe it was
      alive, or ever had been. But with janius it's different. He just gives you
      some traits of a character, he points him out to you passing,&mdash;just
      as I would to a man going along the street,&mdash;and there he is alive
      for ever and ever; not like you and me, that will be dead and buried
      to-morrow or next day, and the most known of us three lines in a parish
      registhry, but he goes down to posterity an example, an illustration&mdash;or
      a warning, maybe&mdash;to thousands and thousands of living men. Don't
      talk to me about fiction! What <i>he</i> thought and felt is truer than
      all that you and I and a score like us ever did or ever will do. The
      creations of janius are the landmarks of humanity; and well for us is it
      that we have such to guide us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All this may be very fine," said Harcourt, contemptuously, "but give <i>me</i>
      the sentiments of a living man, or one that has lived, in preference to
      all the imaginary characters that have ever adorned a story."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as I suppose that you'd say that a soldier in the Blues, or some
      big, hulking corporal in the Guards, is a finer model of the human form
      than ever Praxiteles chiselled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know which I 'd rather have alongside of me in a charge, Doctor," said
      Harcourt, laughing; and then, to change the topic, he pointed to a lone
      cabin on the sea-shore, miles away, as it seemed, from all other
      habitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's Michel Cady's, sir," said Traynor; "he lives by birds,&mdash;hunting
      them saygulls and cormorants through the crevices of the rocks, and
      stealing the eggs. There isn't a precipice that he won't climb, not a
      cliff that he won't face."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if that be his home, the pursuit does not seem a profitable one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis as good as breaking stones on the road for four-pence a day, or
      carrying sea-weed five miles on your back to manure the potatoes," said
      Billy, mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's exactly the very thing that puzzles me," said Harcourt, "why, in a
      country so remarkable for fertility, every one should be so miserably
      poor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you never heard any explanation of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never; at least, never one that satisfied me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor ever will you," said Billy, sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because," said he, drawing a long breath, as if preparing for a
      discourse,&mdash;"because there's no man capable of going into the whole
      subject; for it's not merely an economical question or a social one, but
      it is metaphysical, and religious, and political, and ethnological, and
      historical,&mdash;ay, and geographical too! You have to consider, first,
      who and what are the aborigines. A conquered people that never gave in
      they were conquered. Who are the rulers? A Saxon race that always felt
      that they were infarior to them they ruled over!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove, Doctor, I must stop you there; I never heard any acknowledgment
      of this inferiority you speak of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to get a goold medal for arguin' it out with you," said Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, after all, I don't see how it would resolve the original doubt,"
      said Harcourt. "I want to know why the people are so poor, and I don't
      want to hear of the battle of Clontarf, or the Danes at Dundalk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There it is, you'd like to narrow down a great question of race,
      language, traditions, and laws to a little miserable dispute about labor
      and wages. O Manchester, Manchester! how ye're in the heart of every
      Englishman, rich or poor, gentle or simple! You say you never heard of any
      confession of inferiority. Of course you did n't; but quite the reverse,&mdash;a
      very confident sense of being far better than the poor Irish; and I'll
      tell you how, and why, just as you, yourself, after a discusshion with me,
      when you find yourself dead bate, and not a word to reply, you 'll go home
      to a good dinner and a bottle of wine, dry clothes and a bright fire; and
      no matter how hard my argument pushed you, you'll remember that <i>I'm</i>
      in rags, in a dirty cabin, with potatoes to ate and water to drink, and
      you 'll say, at all events, 'I 'm better off than he is;' and there's your
      superiority, neither more or less,&mdash;there it is! And all the while,
      <i>I'm</i> saying the same thing to <i>myself</i>,&mdash;'Sorrow matter
      for his fine broadcloth, and his white linen, and his very best roast beef
      that he's atin',&mdash;I 'm his master! In all that dignifies the spacies
      in them grand qualities that makes us poets, rhetoricians, and the like,
      in those elegant attributes that, as the poet says,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "In all our pursuits
     Lifts us high above brutes,'"
</pre>
    <p>
      &mdash;in these, I say again, I 'm his master!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      As Billy finished his growing panegyric upon his country and himself, he
      burst out in a joyous laugh, and cried, "Did ye ever hear conceit like
      that? Did ye ever expect to see the day that a ragged poor blackguard like
      <i>me</i> would dare to say as much to one like <i>you?</i> And, after
      all, it's the greatest compliment I could pay you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so, Billy? I don't exactly see <i>that</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that if you weren't a gentleman,&mdash;a raal gentleman, born and
      bred,&mdash;I could never have ventured to tell you what I said now. It is
      because, in <i>your own</i> refined feelings, you can pardon all the
      coarseness of <i>mine</i>, that I have my safety."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're as great a courtier as you are a scholar, Billy," said Harcourt,
      laughing; "meanwhile, I'm not likely to be enlightened as to the cause of
      Irish poverty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'T is a whole volume I could write on the same subject," said Billy; "for
      there's so many causes in operation, com-binin', and assistin', and
      aggravatin' each other. But if you want the head and front of the mischief
      in one word, it is this, that no Irishman ever gave his heart and sowl to
      his own business, but always was mindin' something else that he had
      nothin' to say to; and so, ye see, the priest does be thinkin' of
      politics, the parson's thinkin' of the priest, the people are always on
      the watch for a crack at the agent or the tithe-proctor, and the landlord,
      instead of looking after his property, is up in Dublin dinin' with the
      Lord-Leftinint and abusin' his tenants. I don't want to screen myself, nor
      say I'm better than my neighbors, for though I have a larned profession to
      live by, I 'd rather be writin' a ballad, and singin' it too, down Thomas
      Street, than I 'd be lecturin' at the Surgeons' Hall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are certainly a very strange people," said Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet there's another thing stranger still, which is, that your
      countrymen never took any advantage of our eccentricities, to rule us by;
      and if they had any wit in their heads, they 'd have seen, easy enough,
      that all these traits are exactly the clews to a nation's heart. That's
      what Pitt meant when he said, 'Let me make the <i>songs</i> of a people,
      and I don't care who makes the <i>laws</i>.' Look down now in that glen
      before you, as far as you can see. There's Belmullet, and ain't you glad
      to be so near your journey's end? for you're mighty tired of all this
      discoorsin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, Billy, even when I disagree with what you say, I'm
      pleased to hear your reasons; at the same time, I 'm glad we are drawing
      nigh to this poor boy, and I only trust we may not be too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy muttered a pious concurrence in the wish, and they rode along for
      some time in silence. "There's the Bay of Belmullet now under your feet,"
      cried Billy, as he pulled up short, and pointed with his whip seaward.
      "There's five fathoms, and fine anchoring ground on every inch ye see
      there. There's elegant shelter from tempestuous winds. There's a coast
      rich in herrings, oysters, lobsters, and crabs; farther out there's cod,
      and haddock, and mackerel in the sayson. There's sea wrack for kelp, and
      every other con-vanience any one can require; and a poorer set of devils
      than ye 'll see when we get down there, there's nowhere to be found. Well,
      well! 'if idleness is bliss, it's folly to work hard.'" And with this
      paraphrase, Billy made way for the Colonel, as the path had now become too
      narrow for two abreast, and in this way they descended to the shore.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. A SICK BED
    </h2>
    <p>
      Although the cabin in which the sick boy lay was one of the best in the
      village, its interior presented a picture of great poverty. It consisted
      of a single room, in the middle of which a mud wall of a few feet in
      height formed a sort of partition, abutting against which was the bed,&mdash;the
      one bed of the entire family,&mdash;now devoted to the guest. Two or three
      coarsely fashioned stools, a rickety table, and a still more rickety
      dresser comprised all the furniture. The floor was uneven and fissured,
      and the solitary window was mended with an old hat,&mdash;thus diminishing
      the faint light which struggled through the narrow aperture.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large net, attached to the rafters, hung down in heavy festoons
      overhead, the corks and sinks dangling in dangerous proximity to the heads
      underneath. Several spars and oars littered one corner, and a newly
      painted buoy filled another; but, in spite of all these encumbrances,
      there was space around the fire for a goodly company of some eight or nine
      of all ages, who were pleasantly eating their supper from a large pot of
      potatoes that smoked and steamed in front of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save all here!" cried Billy, as he preceded the Colonel into the
      cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Save ye kindly," was the courteous answer, in a chorus of voices; at the
      same time, seeing a gentleman at the door, the whole party arose at once
      to receive him. Nothing could have surpassed the perfect good-breeding
      with which the fisherman and his wife did the honors of their humble home;
      and Harcourt at once forgot the poverty-struck aspect of the scene in the
      general courtesy of the welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He 's no better, your honor,&mdash;no better at all," said the man, as
      Harcourt drew nigh the sick bed. "He does be always ravin',&mdash;ravin'
      on,&mdash;beggin' and implorin' that we won't take him back to the Castle;
      and if he falls asleep, the first thing he says when he wakes up is,
      'Where am I?&mdash;tell me I'm not at Glencore!' and he keeps on
      screechin', 'Tell me, tell me so!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harcourt bent down over the bed and gazed at him. Slowly and languidly the
      sick boy raised his heavy lids and returned the stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know me, Charley, boy, don't you?" said he, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," muttered he, in a weak tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who am I, Charley? Tell me who is speaking to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said he again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor fellow!" Bighed Harcourt, "he does <i>not</i> know me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's the pain?" asked Billy, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy placed his hand on his forehead, and then on his temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look up! look at <i>me!</i>" said Billy. "Ay, there it is! the pupil does
      not contract,&mdash;there's mischief in the brain. He wants to say
      something to you, sir," said he to Harcourt; "he's makin' signs to you to
      stoop down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harcourt put his ear close to the sick boy's lips, and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear child, of course not," said he, after a pause. "You shall
      remain here, and I will stay with you too. In a few days your father will
      come&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      A wild yell, a shriek that made the cabin ring, now broke from the boy,
      followed by another, and then a third; and then with a spring he arose
      from the bed, and tried to escape. Weak and exhausted as he was, such was
      the strength supplied by fever, it was all that they could do to subdue
      him and replace him in the bed; violent convulsions followed this severe
      access, and it was not till after hours of intense suffering that he
      calmed down again and seemed to slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's more than we know of here, Colonel," said Billy, as he drew him
      to one side. "There's moral causes as well as malady at work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There may be, but I know nothing of them," said Harcourt; and in the
      frank air of the speaker the other did not hesitate to repose his trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we hope to save him, we ought to find out where the mischief lies,"
      said Billy; "for, if ye remark, his ravin' is always upon one subject; he
      never wanders from that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has a dread of home. Some altercation with his father has, doubtless,
      impressed him with this notion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that isn't enough, we must go 'deeper; we want a clew to the part of
      the brain engaged. Meanwhile, here's at him, with the antiphlogistic
      touch;" and he opened his lancet-case, and tucked up his cuffs. "Houlde
      the basin, Biddy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, Harvey himself couldn't do it nater than that. It's an elegant
      study to be feelin' a pulse while the blood is flowin'. It comes at first
      like a dammed-up cataract, a regular out-pouring, just as a young girl
      would tell her love, all wild and tumultuous; then, after a time, she gets
      more temperate, the feelings are relieved, and the ardor is moderated,
      till at last, wearied and worn out, the heart seems to ask for rest; and
      then ye'll remark a settled faint smile coming over the lips, and a clammy
      coldness in the face."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's fainting, sir," broke in Biddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is, ma'am, and it's myself done it," said Billy. "Oh, dear, oh, dear!
      If we could only do with the moral heart what we can with the raal
      physical one, what wonderful poets we 'd be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What hopes have you?" whispered Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best, the very best. There 's youth and a fine constitution to work
      upon; and what more does a doctor want? As ould Marsden said, 'You can't
      destroy these in a fortnight, so the patient must live.' But you must help
      me, Colonel, and you <i>can</i> help me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Command me in any way, Doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's the <i>modus</i>, then. You must go back to the Castle and find
      out, if you can, what happened between his father and <i>him</i>. It does
      not signify now, nor will it for some days; but when he comes to the
      convalescent stage, it's then we 'll need to know how to manage him, and
      what subjects to keep him away from. 'T is the same with the brain as with
      a sprained ankle; you may exercise if you don't twist it; but just come
      down once on the wrong spot, and maybe ye won't yell out!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 'll not quit him, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a senthry on his post, waiting to get a shot at the enemy if he shows
      the top of his head. Ah, sir, if ye only knew physic, ye 'd acknowledge
      there 's nothing as treacherous as dizaze. Ye hunt him out of the brain,
      and then he is in the lungs. Ye chase him out of that, and he skulks in
      the liver. At him there, and he takes to the fibrous membranes, and then
      it's regular hide-and-go-seek all over the body. Trackin' a bear is
      child's play to it." And so saying, Billy held the Colonel's stirrup for
      him to mount, and giving his most courteous salutation, and his best
      wishes for a good journey, he turned and re-entered the cabin.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. THE "PROJECT"
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was not without surprise that Harcourt saw Glencore enter the
      drawing-room a few minutes before dinner. Very pale and very feeble, he
      slowly traversed the room, giving a hand to each of his guests, and
      answering the inquiries for his health by a sickly smile, while he said,
      "As you see me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to dine with you to-day, Harcourt," said he, with an attempt
      at gayety of manner. "Upton tells me that a little exertion of this kind
      will do me good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upton's right," cried the Colonel, "especially if he added that you
      should take a glass or two of that admirable Burgundy. My life on 't but
      that is the liquor to set a man on his legs again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did n't remark that this was exactly the effect it produced upon you t'
      other night," said Upton, with one of his own sly laughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That comes of drinking it in bad company," retorted Harcourt; "a man is
      driven to take two glasses for one."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the dinner proceeded, Glencore rallied considerably, taking his part in
      the conversation, and evidently enjoying the curiously contrasted
      temperaments at either side of him. The one, all subtlety, refinement, and
      finesse; the other, out-spoken, rude, and true-hearted; rarely correct in
      a question of taste, but invariably right in every matter of honorable
      dealing. Though it was clear enough that Upton relished the eccentricities
      whose sallies he provoked, it was no less easy to see how thoroughly he
      appreciated the frank and manly nature of the old soldier; nor could all
      the crafty habits of his acute mind overcome the hearty admiration with
      which he regarded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in the unrestricted ease of these "little dinners," where two or
      three old friends are met, that social intercourse assumes its most
      charming form. The usages of the great world, which exact a species of
      uniformity of breeding and manners, are here laid aside, and men talk with
      all the bias and prejudices of their true nature, dashing the topics
      discussed with traits of personality, and even whims, that are most
      amusing. How little do we carry away of tact or wisdom from the grand
      banquets of life; and what pleasant stores of thought, what charming
      memories remain to us, after those small gatherings!
    </p>
    <p>
      How, as I write this, one little room rises to my recollection, with its
      quaint old sideboard of carved oak; its dark-brown cabinets, curiously
      sculptured; its heavy old brocade curtains, and all its queer devices of
      knick-knackery, where such meetings once were held, and where, throwing
      off the cares of life,&mdash;shut out from them, as it were, by the
      massive folds of the heavy drapery across the door,&mdash;. we talked in
      all the fearless freedom of old friendship, rambling away from theme to
      theme, contrasting our experiences, balancing our views in life, and
      mingling through our converse the racy freshness of a boy's enjoyment with
      the sager counsels of a man's reflectiveness. Alas! how very early is it
      sometimes in life that we tread "the banquet-hall deserted." But to our
      story: the evening wore pleasantly on; Upton talked, as few but himself
      could do, upon the public questions of the day; and Harcourt, with many a
      blunt interruption, made the discourse but more easy and amusing. The
      soldier was, indeed, less at his ease than the others. It was not alone
      that many of the topics were not such as he was most familiar with, but he
      felt angry and indignant at Glencore's seeming indifference as to the fate
      of his son. Not a single reference to him even occurred; his name was
      never even passingly mentioned. Nothing but the careworn, sickly face, the
      wasted form and dejected expression before him, could have restrained
      Harcourt from alluding to the boy. He bethought him, however, that any
      indiscretion on his part might have the gravest consequences. Upton, too,
      might have said something to quiet Glencore's mind. "At all events, I'll
      wait," said he to himself; "for wherever there is much delicacy in a
      negotiation, I generally make a mess of it." The more genially, therefore,
      did Glencore lend himself to the pleasure of the conversation, the more
      provoked did Harcourt feel at his heartlessness, and the more did the
      struggle cost him to control his own sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upton, who detected the secret working of men's minds with a marvellous
      exactness, saw how the poor Colonel was suffering, and that, in all
      probability, some unhappy explosion would at last ensue, and took an
      opportunity of remarking that though all this chit-chat was delightful for
      them, Glencore was still a sick man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must n't forget, Harcourt," said he, "that a chicken-broth diet
      includes very digestible small-talk; and here we are leading our poor
      friend through politics, war, diplomacy, and the rest of it, just as if he
      had the stomach of an old campaigner and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the brain of a great diplomatist! Say it out, man, and avow honestly
      the share of excellence you accord to each of us," broke in Harcourt,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would to Heaven we could exchange," sighed Upton, languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The saints forbid!" exclaimed the other; "and it would do us little good
      if we were able."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd never know what to do with that fine intellect if I had it; and as
      for <i>you</i>, what with your confounded pills and mixtures, your
      infernal lotions and embrocations, you'd make my sound system as bad as
      your own in three months' time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite wrong, my dear Harcourt; I should treat the stomach as you
      would do the brain,&mdash;give it next to nothing to do, in the hopes it
      might last the longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There now, good night," said Harcourt; "he's always the better for
      bitters, whether he gives or takes them." And with a good-humored laugh he
      left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore's eyes followed him as he retired; and then, as they closed, an
      expression as of long-repressed suffering settled down on his features so
      marked that Upton hastily asked,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you ill, are you in pain, Glencore?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In pain? Yes," said he, "these two hours back I have been suffering
      intensely; but there's no help for it! Must you really leave this
      to-morrow, Upton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must. This letter from the Foreign Office requires my immediate
      presence in London, with a very great likelihood of being obliged to start
      at once for the Continent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I had so much to say,&mdash;so many things to consult you on," sighed
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you equal to it now?" asked Upton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must try, at all events. You shall learn my plan." He was silent for
      some minutes, and sat with his head resting on his hand, in deep
      reflection. At last he said, "Has it ever occurred to you, Upton, that
      some incident of the past, some circumstance in itself insignificant,
      should rise up, as it were, in after life to suit an actual emergency,
      just as though fate had fashioned it for such a contingency?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot say that I have experienced what you describe, if, indeed, I
      fully understand it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll explain better by an instance. You know now,"&mdash;here his voice
      became slow, and the words fell with a marked distinctness,&mdash;"you
      know now what I intend by this woman. Well, just as if to make my plan
      more feasible, a circumstance intended for a very different object offers
      itself to my aid. When my uncle, Sir Miles Herrick, heard that I was about
      to marry a foreigner, he declared that he would never leave me a shilling
      of his fortune. I am not very sure that I cared much for the threat when
      it was uttered. My friends, however, thought differently; and though they
      did not attempt to dissuade me from my marriage, they suggested that I
      should try some means of overcoming this prejudice; at all events, that I
      should not hurry on the match without an effort to obtain his consent. I
      agreed,&mdash;not very willingly, indeed,&mdash;and so the matter
      remained. The circumstance was well known amongst my two or three most
      intimate friends, and constantly discussed by them. I need n't tell you
      that the tone in which such things are talked of as often partakes of
      levity as seriousness. They gave me all manner of absurd counsels, one
      more outrageously ridiculous than the other. At last, one day,&mdash;we
      were picnicking at Baia,&mdash;Old Clifford,&mdash;you remember that
      original who had the famous schooner-yacht 'The Breeze,'&mdash;well, he
      took me aside after dinner, and said, 'Glencore, I have it,&mdash;I have
      just hit upon the expedient. Your uncle and I were old chums at Christ
      Church fifty years ago. What if we were to tell him that you were going to
      marry a daughter of mine? I don't think he'd object. I 'm half certain he
      'd not. I have been abroad these five-and-thirty years. Nobody in England
      knows much about me now. Old Herrick can't live forever; he is my senior
      by a good ten or twelve years; and if the delusion only lasts his time&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But perhaps you have a daughter?' broke I in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I have, and she is married already, so there is no risk on that score.'
      I need n't repeat all that he said for, nor that I urged against, the
      project; for though it was after dinner, and we all had drunk very freely,
      the deception was one I firmly rejected. When a man shows a great desire
      to serve you on a question of no common difficulty, it is very hard to be
      severe upon his counsels, however unscrupulous they may be. In fact, you
      accept them as proofs of friendship only the stronger, seeing how much
      they must have cost him to offer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upton smiled dubiously, and Glencore, blushing slightly, said, "You don't
      concur in this, I perceive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not exactly," said Upton, in his silkiest of tones; "I rather regard
      these occasions as I should do the generosity of a man who, filling my
      hand with base money, should say, 'Pass it if you can!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In this case, however," resumed Glencore, "he took his share of the
      fraud, or at least was willing to do so, for I distinctly said 'No' to the
      whole scheme. He grew very warm about it; at one moment appealing to my
      'good sense, not to kick seven thousand a year out of the window;' at the
      next, in half-quarrelsome mood, asking 'if it were any objection I had to
      be connected with his family.' To get rid of a very troublesome subject,
      and to end a controversy that threatened to disturb a party, I said at
      last, 'We 'll talk it over to-morrow, Clifford, and if your arguments be
      as good as your heart, then perhaps they may yet convince me.' This ended
      the theme, and we parted. I started the next day on a shooting excursion
      into Calabria, and when I got back it was not of meeting Clifford I was
      thinking. I hastened to meet the Delia Torres, and then came our
      elopement. You know the rest. We went to the East, passed the winter in
      Upper Egypt, and came to Cairo in spring, where Charley was born. I got
      back to Naples after a year or two, and then found that my uncle had just
      died, and in consequence of my marrying the daughter of his old and
      attached friend, Sir Guy Clifford, had reversed the intention of his will,
      and by a codicil left me his sole heir. It was thus that my marriage, and
      even my boy's birth, became inserted in the Peerage; my solicitor, in his
      vast eagerness for my interests, having taken care to indorse the story
      with his own name. The disinherited nephews and nieces, the half-cousins
      and others, soon got wind of the real facts, and contested the will, on
      the ground of its being executed under a delusion. I, of course, would not
      resist their claim, and satisfied myself by denying the statement as to my
      marriage; and so, after affording the current subject of gossip for a
      season, I was completely forgotten, the more as we went to live abroad,
      and never mixed with English. And now, Upton, it is this same incident I
      would utilize for the present occasion, though, as I said before, when it
      originally occurred it had a very different signification."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't exactly see how," said Upton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In this wise. My real marriage was never inserted in the Peerage. I'll
      now manage that it shall so appear, to give me the opportunity of formally
      contradicting it, and alluding to the strange persistence with which,
      having married me some fifteen years ago to a lady who never existed, they
      now are pleased to unite me to one whose character might have secured me
      against the calumny. I 'll threaten an action for libel, etc., obtain a
      most full, explicit, and abject apology, and then, when this has gone the
      round of all the journals of Europe, her doom is sealed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she has surely letters, writings, proofs of some sort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Upton, I have not left a scrap in her possession; she has not a line,
      not a letter to vindicate her. On the night I broke open her writing-desk,
      I took away everything that bore the traces of my own hand. I tell you
      again she is in my power, and never was power less disposed to mercy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once more, my dear friend," said Upton, "I am driven to tell you that I
      cannot be a profitable counsellor in a matter to every detail of which I
      object. Consider calmly for one moment what you are doing. See how, in
      your desire to be avenged upon <i>her</i>, you throw the heaviest share of
      the penalty on your own poor boy. I am not her advocate now. I will not
      say one word to mitigate the course of your anger towards her, but
      remember that you are actually defrauding him of his birthright. This is
      not a question where you have a choice. There is no discretionary power
      left you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll do it," said Glencore, with a savage energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In other words, to wreak a vengeance upon one, you are prepared to
      immolate another, not only guiltless, but who possesses every claim to
      your love and affection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you think that if I sacrifice the last tie that attaches me to
      life, Upton, that I retire from this contest heart-whole? No, far from it;
      I go forth from the struggle broken, blasted, friendless!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you mean that this vengeance should outlive you? Suppose, for
      instance, that she should survive you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shall be to live on in shame, then," cried he, savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And were she to die first?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case&mdash;I have not thought well enough about that. It is
      possible,&mdash;it is just possible; but these are subtleties, Upton, to
      detach me from my purpose, or weaken my resolution to carry it through.
      You would apply the craft of your calling to the case, and, by suggesting
      emergencies, open a road to evasions. Enough for me the present. I neither
      care to prejudge the future, nor control it. I know," cried he, suddenly,
      and with eyes flashing angrily as he spoke,&mdash;"I know that if you
      desire to use the confidence I have reposed in you against me, you can
      give me trouble and even difficulty; but I defy Sir Horace Upton, with all
      his skill and all his cunning, to outwit me."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was that in the tone in which he uttered these words, and the
      exaggerated energy of his manner, that convinced Upton, Glencore's reason
      was not intact. It was not what could amount to aberration in the ordinary
      sense, but sufficient evidence was there to show that judgment had become
      so obscured by passion that the mental power was weakened by the moral.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, therefore, Upton," cried he, "before we part, do you leave this
      house my friend or my enemy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is as your sincere, attached friend that I now dispute with you, inch
      by inch, a dangerous position, with a judgment under no influence from
      passion, viewing this question by the coldest of all tests,&mdash;mere
      expediency&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      "There it is," broke in Glencore; "you claim an advantage over me, because
      you are devoid of feeling; but this is a case, sir, where the sense of
      injury gives the instinct of reparation. Is it nothing to me, think you,
      that I am content to go down dishonored to my grave, but also to be the
      last of my name and station? Is it nothing that a whole line of honorable
      ancestry is extinguished at once? Is it nothing that I surrender him who
      formed my sole solace and companionship in life? You talk of your calm,
      unbiassed mind; but I tell you, till your brain be on fire like mine, and
      your heart swollen to very bursting, that you have no right to dictate to
      <i>me!</i> Besides, it is done! The blow has fallen," added he, with a
      deeper solemnity of voice. "The gulf that separates us is already created.
      She and I can meet no more. But why continue this contest? It was to aid
      me in directing that boy's fortunes I first sought your advice, not to
      attempt to dissuade me from what I will not be turned from."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way can I serve you?" said Upton, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you consent to be his guardian?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore seized the other's hand, and pressed it to his heart, and for
      some seconds he could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is all that I ask, Upton," said he. "It is the greatest boon
      friendship could accord me. I need no more. Could you have remained here a
      day or two more, we could have settled upon some plan together as to his
      future life; as it is, we can arrange it by letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He must leave this," said Upton, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course,&mdash;at once!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How far is Harcourt to be informed in this matter; have you spoken to him
      already?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; nor mean to do so. I should have from <i>him</i> nothing but
      reproaches for having betrayed the boy into false hopes of a station he
      was never to fill. You must tell Harcourt. I leave it to yourself to find
      the suitable moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall need his assistance," said Upton, whose quick faculties were
      already busily travelling many a mile of the future. "I 'll see him
      to-night, and try what can be done. In a few days you will have turned
      over in your mind what you yourself destine for him,&mdash;the fortune you
      mean to give&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is already done," said Glencore, laying a sealed letter on the table.
      "All that I purpose in his behalf you will find there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All this detail is too much for you, Glencore," said the other, seeing
      that a weary, depressed expression had come over him, while his voice grew
      weaker with every word. "I shall not leave this till late to-morrow, so
      that we can meet again. And now good night."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. A TÊTE-À-TÊTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Harcourt was aroused from his sound sleep by Upton, and requested in
      the very blandest tones of that eminent diplomatist to lend him every
      attention of his "very remarkable faculties," he was not by any means
      certain that he was not engaged in a strange dream; nor was the suspicion
      at all dispelled by the revelations addressed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just dip the end of that towel in the water, Upton, and give it to me,"
      cried he at last; and then, wiping his face and forehead, said, "Have I
      heard you aright,&mdash;there was no marriage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Upton nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a shameful way he has treated this poor boy, then!" cried the other.
      "I never heard of anything equal to it in cruelty, and I conclude it was
      breaking this news to the lad that drove him out to sea on that night, and
      brought on this brain fever. By Jove, I 'd not take <i>his</i> title, and
      <i>your</i> brains, to have such a sin on my conscience!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are happily not called on to judge the act," said Upton, cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why not? Is it not every honest man's duty to reprobate whatever he
      detects dishonorable or disgraceful? I do judge him, and sentence him too,
      and I say, moreover, that a more cold-blooded piece of cruelty I never
      heard of. He trains up this poor boy from childhood to fancy himself the
      heir to his station and fortune; he nurses in him all the pride that only
      a high rank can cover; and then, when the lad's years have brought him to
      the period when these things assume all their value, he sends for him to
      tell him he is a bastard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not impossible that I think worse of Glencore's conduct than you do
      yourself," said Upton, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you never told him so, I'll be sworn,&mdash;you never said to him it
      was a rascally action. I'll lay a hundred pounds on it, you only
      expostulated on the inexpediency, or the inconvenience, or some such
      trumpery consideration, and did not tell him, in round numbers, that what
      he had done was an infamy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I fancy you'd lose your money, pretty much as you are losing your
      temper,&mdash;that is, without getting anything in requital."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you say to him, then?" said Harcourt, slightly abashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A great deal in the same strain as you have just spoken in, doubtless not
      as warm in vituperation, but possibly as likely to produce an effect; nor
      is it in the least necessary to dwell upon that. What Glencore has done,
      and what I have said about it, both belong to the past. They are over,&mdash;they
      are irrevocable. It is to what concerns the present and the future I wish
      now to address myself, and to interest you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, the boy's name was in the Peerage,&mdash;I read it there myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Harcourt, you must have paid very little attention to me a while
      ago, or you would have understood how that occurred."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And here were all the people, the tenantry on the estate, calling him the
      young lord, and the poor fellow growing up with the proud consciousness
      that the title was his due."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is not a hardship of the case I have not pictured to my own mind as
      forcibly as you can describe it," said Upton; "but I really do not
      perceive that any reprobation of the past has in the slightest assisted me
      in providing for the future."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then," murmured Harcourt,&mdash;for all the while he was pursuing his
      own train of thought, quite irrespective of all Upton was saying,&mdash;"and
      then he turns him adrift on the world without friend or fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is precisely that he may have both the one and the other that I have
      come to confer with you now," replied Upton. "Glencore has made a liberal
      provision for the boy, and asked me to become his guardian. I have no
      fancy for the trust, but I did n't see how I could decline it. In this
      letter he assigns to him an income, which shall be legally secured to him.
      He commits to me the task of directing his education, and suggesting some
      future career, and for both these objects I want your counsel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Education,&mdash;prospects,&mdash;why, what are you talking about? A poor
      fellow who has not a name, nor a home, nor one to acknowledge him,&mdash;what
      need has he of education, or what chance of prospects? I'd send him to
      sea, and if he wasn't drowned before he came to manhood, I'd give him his
      fortune, whatever it was, and say, 'Go settle in some of the colonies.'
      You have no right to train him up to meet fresh mortifications and insults
      in life; to be flouted by every fellow that has a father, and outraged by
      every cur whose mother was married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And are the colonies especially inhabited by illegitimate offspring?"
      said Upton, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At least he'd not be met with a rebuff at every step he made. The rude
      life of toil would be better than the polish of a civilization that could
      only reflect upon him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not badly said, Harcourt," said Upton, smiling; "but as to the boy, I
      have other prospects. He has, if I mistake not, very good faculties. You
      estimate them even higher. I don't see why they should be neglected. If he
      merely possess the mediocrity of gifts which make men tolerable lawyers
      and safe doctors, why, perhaps, he may turn them into some channel. If he
      really can lay claim to higher qualities, they must not be thrown away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which means that he ought to be bred up to diplomacy," said Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," said the other, with a bland inclination of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what can an old dragoon like myself contribute to such an object?"
      asked Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can be of infinite service in many ways," said Upton; "and for the
      present I wish to leave the boy in your care, till I can learn something
      about my own destiny. This, of course, I shall know in a few days.
      Meanwhile you 'll look after him, and as soon as his removal becomes safe
      you 'll take him away from this,&mdash;it does not much matter whither;
      probably some healthy, secluded spot in Wales, for a week or two, would be
      advisable. Glencore and he must not meet again; if ever they are to do so,
      it must be after a considerable lapse of time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you thought of a name for him, or is his to be still Massy?" asked
      Harcourt, bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He may take the maternal name of Glencore's family, and be called Doyle,
      and the settlements could be drawn up in that name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be shot if I like to have any share in the whole transaction! Some
      day or other it will all come out, and who knows how much blame may be
      imputed to us, perhaps for actually advising the entire scheme," said
      Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must see, my dear Harcourt, that you are only refusing aid to
      alleviate an evil, and not to devise one. If this boy&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;well&mdash;I give in. I'd rather comply at once than be
      preached into acquiescence. Even when you do not convince me, I feel
      ashamed to oppose myself to so much cleverness; so, I repeat, I 'm at your
      orders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admirably spoken," said Upton, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My greatest difficulty of all," said Harcourt, "will be to meet Glencore
      again after this. I know&mdash;I feel&mdash;I never can forgive him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps he will not ask forgiveness, Harcourt," said the other, with one
      of his slyest of looks. "Glencore is a strange, self-opinionated fellow,
      and has amongst other odd notions that of going the road he likes best
      himself. Besides, there is another consideration here, and with no man
      will it weigh more than with yourself. Glencore has been dangerously ill,&mdash;at
      this moment we can scarcely say that he has recovered; his state is yet
      one of anxiety and doubt. You are the last who would forget such
      infirmity; nor is it necessary to secure your pity that I should say how
      seriously the poor fellow is now suffering."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust he'll not speak to me about this business," said Harcourt, after
      a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very probably he will not. He will know that I have already told you
      everything, so that there will be no need of any communication from him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish from my heart and soul I had never come here. I would to Heaven I
      had gone away at once, as I first intended. I like that boy; I feel he has
      fine stuff in him; and now&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, Harcourt, it's the fault of all soft-hearted fellows, like
      yourself, that their kindliness degenerates into selfishness, and they
      have such a regard for their own feelings that they never agree to
      anything that wounds them. Just remember that you and I have very small
      parts in this drama, and the best way we can do is to fill them without
      giving ourselves the airs of chief characters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're at your old game, Upton; you are always ready to wet yourself,
      provided you give another fellow a ducking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only if he get a worse one, or take longer to dry after it," remarked
      Upton, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite true, by Jove!" chimed in the other; "you take special care to come
      off best. And now you 're going," added he, as Upton rose to withdraw,
      "and I'm certain that I have not half comprehended what you want from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have it in writing, Harcourt; I'll send you a clear despatch
      the first spare moment I can command after I reach town. The boy will not
      be fit to move for some time to come, and so good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know where they are going to send you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot frame even a conjecture," sighed Upton, languidly. "I ought to
      be in the Brazils for a week or so about that slave question; and then the
      sooner I reach Constantinople the better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sha' n't they want you at Paris?" asked Harcourt, who felt a kind of
      quiet vengeance in developing what he deemed the weak vanity of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," sighed he again; "but I can't be everywhere." And so saying, he
      lounged away, while it would have taken a far more subtle listener than
      Harcourt to say whether he was mystifying the other, or the dupe of his
      own self-esteem.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. BILLY TRAYNOR AS ORATOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three weeks rolled over,&mdash;an interval not without its share of
      interest for the inhabitants of the little village of Leenane, since on
      one morning Mr. Craggs had made his appearance on his way to Clifden, and
      after an absence of two days returned to the Castle. The subject for
      popular discussion and surmise had not yet declined, when a boat was seen
      to leave Glencore, heavily laden with trunks and travelling gear; and as
      she neared the land, the "lord" was detected amongst the passengers,
      looking very ill,&mdash;almost dying; he passed up the little street of
      the village, scarcely noticing the uncovered heads which saluted him
      respectfully. Indeed, he scarcely lifted up his eyes, and, as the acute
      observers remarked, never once turned a glance towards the opposite shore,
      where the Castle stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not reached the end of the village, when a chaise with four horses
      arrived at the spot. No time was lost in arranging the trunks and
      portmanteaus, and Lord Glencore sat moodily on a bank, listlessly
      regarding what went forward. At length Craggs came up, and, touching his
      cap in military fashion, announced all was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glencore arose slowly, and looked languidly around him; his features
      wore a mingled expression of weariness and anxiety, like one not fully
      awakened from an oppressive dream. He turned his eyes on the people, who
      at a respectful distance stood around, and in a voice of peculiar
      melancholy said, "Good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good journey to you, my Lord, and safe back again to us," cried a
      number together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh&mdash;what&mdash;what was that?" cried he, suddenly; and the tones
      were shrill and discordant in which he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      A warning gesture from Craggs imposed silence on the crowd, and not a word
      was uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought they said something about coming back again," muttered
      Glencore, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They were wishing you a good journey, my Lord," replied Craggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that was it, was it?" And so saying, with bent-down head he walked
      feebly forward and entered the carriage. Craggs was speedily on the box,
      and the next moment they were away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no part of our task to dwell on the sage speculations and wise
      surmises of the village on this event. They had not, it is true, much
      "evidence" before them, but they were hardy guessers, and there was very
      little within the limits of possibility which they did not summon to the
      aid of their imaginations. All, however, were tolerably agreed upon one
      point,&mdash;that to leave the place while the young lord was still unable
      to quit his bed, and too weak to sit up, was unnatural and unfeeling;
      traits which, "after all," they thought "not very surprising, since the
      likes of them lords never cared for anybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Harcourt still remained at Glencore, and under his rigid sway the
      strictest blockade of the coast was maintained, nor was any intercourse
      whatever permitted with the village. A boat from the Castle, meeting
      another from Leenane, half way in the lough, received the letters and
      whatever other resources the village supplied. All was done with the rigid
      exactness of a quarantine regulation; and if the mainland had been
      scourged with plague, stricter measures of exclusion could scarcely have
      been enforced.
    </p>
    <p>
      In comparison with the present occupant of the Castle, the late one was a
      model of amiability; and the village, as is the wont in the case, now
      discovered a vast number of good qualities in the "lord," when they had
      lost him. After a while, however, the guesses, the speculations, and the
      comparisons all died away, and the Castle of Glencore was as much
      dreamland to their imaginations as, seen across the lough in the dim
      twilight of an autumn evening, its towers might have appeared to their
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about a month after Lord Glencore's departure, of a fine, soft
      evening in summer, Billy Traynor suddenly appeared in the village. Billy
      was one of a class who, whatever their rank in life, are always what
      Coleridge would have called "noticeable men." He was soon, therefore,
      surrounded with a knot of eager and inquiring friends, all solicitous to
      know something of the life he was leading, what they were doing "beyant at
      the Castle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a mighty quiet studious kind of life," said Billy, "but agrees with
      me wonderfully; for I may say that until now I never was able to give my
      'janius' fair play. Professional life is the ruin of the student; and
      being always obleeged to be thinkin' of the bags destroyed my taste for
      letters." A grin of self-approval at his own witticism closed this speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But is it true, Billy, the lord is going to break up house entirely, and
      not come back here?" asked Peter Slevin, the sacristan, whose rank and
      station warranted his assuming the task of cross-questioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There 's various ways of breakin' up a house," said Billy. "Ye may do so
      in a moral sinse, or in a physical sinse; you may obliterate, or
      extinguish, or, without going so far, you may simply obfuscate,&mdash;do
      you perceave?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" said the sacristan, on whom every eye was now bent, to see if he
      was able to follow subtleties that had outwitted the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And whin I say <i>obfuscate</i>," resumed Billy, "I open a question of
      disputed etymology, bekase tho' Lucretius thinks the word <i>obfuscator</i>
      original, there's many supposes it comes from <i>ob</i> and <i>fucus</i>,
      the dye the ancients used in their wool, as we find in Horace, <i>lana
      fuco medicata</i>; while Cicero employs it in another sense, and says, <i>facere
      fucum</i>, which is as much as to say, humbuggin' somebody,&mdash;do ye
      mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begorra, he might guess that anyhow!" muttered a shrewd little tailor,
      with a significance that provoked hearty laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now," continued Billy, with an air of triumph, "we'll proceed to the
      next point."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye needn't trouble yerself then," said Terry Lynch, "for Peter has gone
      home."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, to the amusement of the meeting, it turned out to be the case; the
      sacristan had retired from the controversy. "Come in here to Mrs. Moore's,
      Billy, and take a glass with us," said Terry; "it isn't often we see you
      in these parts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the honorable company will graciously vouchsafe and condescind to let
      me trate them to a half-gallon," said Billy, "it will be the proudest
      event of my terrestrial existence."
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposition was received with a cordial enthusiasm, flattering to all
      concerned; and in a few minutes after, Billy Traynor sat at the head of a
      long table in the neat parlor of "The Griddle," with a company of some
      fifteen or sixteen very convivially disposed friends around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I was Cæsar, or Lucretius, or Nebuchadnezzar, I couldn't be prouder,"
      said Billy, as he looked down the board. "And let moralists talk as they
      will, there's a beautiful expansion of sentiment, there's a fine genial
      overflowin' of the heart, in gatherin's like this, where we mingle our
      feelin's and our philosophy; and our love and our learning walk hand in
      hand like brothers&mdash;pass the sperits, Mr. Shea. If we look to the
      ancient writers, what do we see!&mdash;Lemons! bring in some lemons,
      Mickey.&mdash;What do we see, I say, but that the very highest enjoyment
      of the haythen gods was&mdash;Hot wather! why won't they send in more hot
      wather?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begorra, if I was a haythen god, I 'd like a little whisky in it,"
      muttered Terry, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where was I?" asked Billy, a little disconcerted by this sally, and the
      laugh it excited. "I was expatiatin' upon celestial convivialities. The <i>nodes
      coenoeque deum</i>,&mdash;them elegant hospitalities where wisdom was
      moistened with nectar, and wit washed down with ambrosia. It is not, by
      coorse, to be expected," continued he, modestly, "that we mere mortials
      can compete with them elegant refections. But, as Ovid says, we can at
      least <i>diem jucundam decipere</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      The unknown tongue had now restored to Billy all the reverence and respect
      of his auditory, and he continued to expatiate very eloquently on the
      wholesome advantages to be derived from convivial intercourse, both
      amongst gods and men; rather slyly intimating that either on the score of
      the fluids, or the conversation, his own leanings lay towards "the
      humanities."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For, after all," said he, "'tis our own wakenesses is often the source of
      our most refined enjoyments. No, Mrs. Cassidy, ye need n't be blushin'. I
      'm considerin' my subject in a high ethnological and metaphysical sinse."
      Mrs. Cassidy's confusion, and the mirth it excited, here interrupted the
      orator.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The meeting is never tired of hearin' you, Billy," said Terry Lynch; "but
      if it was plazin' to ye to give us a song, we'd enjoy it greatly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Billy, with a sigh, "I have taken my partin' kiss with the
      Muses; <i>non mihi licet increpare digitis lyram</i>:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "'No more to feel poetic fire,
        No more to touch the soundin' lyre;
     But wiser coorses to begin,
        I now forsake my violin.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      An honest outburst of regret and sorrow broke from the assembly, who
      eagerly pressed for an explanation of this calamitous change.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The thing is this," said Billy: "if a man is a creature of mere leisure
      and amusement, the fine arts&mdash;and by the fine arts I mean music,
      paintin', and the ladies&mdash;is an elegant and very refined subject of
      cultivation; but when you raise your cerebrial faculties to grander and
      loftier considerations, to explore the difficult ragions of polemic or
      political truth, to investigate the subtleties of the schools, and
      penetrate the mysteries of science, then, take my word for it, the fine
      arts is just snares,&mdash;devil a more than snares! And whether it is
      soft sounds seduces you, or elegant tints, or the union of both,&mdash;women,
      I mane,&mdash;you 'll never arrive at anything great or tri-um-phant till
      you wane yourself away from the likes of them vanities. Look at the
      haythen mythology; consider for a moment who is the chap that represents
      Music,&mdash;a lame blackguard, with an ugly face, they call Pan. Ay,
      indeed, Pan! If you wanted to see what respect they had for the art, it's
      easy enough to guess, when this crayture represints it; and as to
      Paintin', on my conscience, they have n't a god at all that ever took to
      the brush.&mdash;Pass up the sperits, Mickey," said he, somewhat blown and
      out of breath by this effort. "Maybe," said he, "I'm wearin' you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, no," loudly responded the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe I'm imposin' too much of personal details on the house," added he,
      pompously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all; never a bit," cried the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because," resumed he, slowly, "if I did so, I 'd have at least the excuse
      of say in', like the great Pitt, 'These may be my last words from this
      place.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      An unfeigned murmur of sorrow ran through the meeting, and he resumed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, ladies and gintlemin, Billy Traynor is takin' his 'farewell benefit;'
      he's not humbuggin'. I 'm not like them chaps that's always positively
      goin', but stays on at the unanimous request of the whole world. No; I'm
      really goin' to leave you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for? Where to, Billy?" broke from a number of voices together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll tell ye," said he,&mdash;"at least so far as I can tell; because it
      would n't be right nor decent to 'print the whole of the papers for the
      house,' as they say in parliamint. I 'm going abroad with the young lord;
      we are going to improve our minds, and cultivate our janiuses, by study
      and foreign travel. We are first to settle in Germany, where we 're to
      enter a University, and commince a coorse of modern tongues, French,
      Sweadish, and Spanish; imbibin' at the same time a smatterin' of science,
      such as chemistry, conchology, and the use of the globes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh dear! oh dear!" murmured the meeting, in wonder and admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm not goin' to say that we 'll neglect mechanics, metaphysics, and
      astrology; for we mane to be cosmonopolists in knowledge. As for myself,
      ladies and gintlemin, it's a proud day that sees me standin' here to say
      these words. I, that was ragged, without a shoe to my foot,&mdash;without
      breeches,&mdash;never mind, I was, as the poet says, <i>nudus nummis ac
      vestimentis</i>,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "'I have n't sixpence in my pack,
     I have n't small clothes to my back.'
</pre>
    <p>
      carryin' the bag many a weary mile, through sleet and snow, for six pounds
      tin per annum, and no pinsion for wounds or superannuation; and now I 'm
      to be&mdash;it is n't easy to say what&mdash;to the young lord a spacies
      of humble companion,&mdash;not maniai, do you mind, nothing manial; what
      the Latins called a __famulus, which was quite a different thing from a <i>servus</i>.
      The former bein' a kind of domestic adviser, a deputy-assistant,
      monitor-general, as a body might say. There, now, if I discoorsed for a
      month, I could n't tell you more about myself and my future prospects. I
      own to you that I 'm proud of my good luck, and I would n't exchange it to
      be Emperor of Jamaica, or King of the Bahamia Islands."
    </p>
    <p>
      If we have been prolix in our office of reporter to Billy Traynor, our
      excuse is that his discourse will have contributed so far to the reader's
      enlightenment as to save us the task of recapitulation. At the same time,
      it is but justice to the accomplished orator that we should say we have
      given but the most meagre outline of an address which, to use the
      newspaper phrase, "occupied three hours in the delivery." The truth was,
      Billy was in vein; the listeners were patient, the punch strong: nor is it
      every speaker who has had the good fortune of such happy accessories.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. THE CASCINE AT FLORENCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was spring, and in Italy! one of those half-dozen days, at very most,
      when, the feeling of winter departed, a gentle freshness breathes through
      the air; trees stir softly, and as if by magic; the earth becomes carpeted
      with flowers, whose odors seem to temper, as it were, the exciting
      atmosphere. An occasional cloud, fleecy and jagged, sails lazily aloft,
      marking its shadow on the mountain side. In a few days&mdash;a few hours,
      perhaps&mdash;the blue sky will be unbroken, the air hushed, a hot breath
      will move among the leaves, or pant over the trickling fountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this fast-flitting period,&mdash;we dare not call it season,&mdash;the
      Cascine of Florence is singularly beautiful; on one side, the gentle river
      stealing past beneath the shadowing foliage; on the other, the picturesque
      mountain towards Fiesole, dotted with its palaces and terraced gardens.
      The ancient city itself is partly seen, and the massive Duomo and the
      Palazzo Vecchio tower proudly above the trees! What other people of Europe
      have such a haunt?&mdash;what other people would know so thoroughly how to
      enjoy it? The day was drawing to a close, and the Piazzone was now filled
      with equipages. There were the representatives of every European people,
      and of nations far away over the seas,&mdash;splendid Russians, brilliant
      French, splenetic, supercilious English, and ponderous Germans, mingled
      with the less marked nationalities of Belgium and Holland, and even
      America. Everything that called itself Fashion was there to swell the
      tide; and although a choice military band was performing with exquisite
      skill the favorite overtures of the day, the noise and tumult of
      conversation almost drowned their notes. Now, the Cascine is to the world
      of society what the Bourse is to the world of trade. It is the great
      centre of all news and intelligence, where markets and bargains of
      intercourse are transacted, and where the scene of past pleasure is
      revived, and the plans of future enjoyment are canvassed. The great and
      the wealthy are there, to see and to meet with each other. The proud
      equipages lie side by side, like great liners; while phaetons, like fast
      frigates, shoot swiftly by, and solitary dandies flit past in varieties of
      conveyance to which sea-craft can offer no analogies. All are busy, eager,
      and occupied. Scandal holds here its festival, and the misdeeds of every
      capital of Europe are now being discussed. The higher themes of politics
      occupy but few; the interests of literature attract still less. It is
      essentially of the world they talk, and it must be owned they do it like
      adepts. The last witticism of Paris,&mdash;the last duel at Berlin,&mdash;who
      has fled from his creditors in England,&mdash;who has run away from her
      husband at Naples,&mdash;all are retailed with a serious circumstantiality
      that would lead one to believe that gossip maintained its "own
      correspondent" in every city of the Continent. Moralists might fancy,
      perhaps, that in the tone these subjects are treated they would mingle a
      reprobation of the bad, and a due estimate of the opposite, if it ever
      occurred at all; but as surely would they be disappointed. Never were
      censors more lenient,&mdash;never were critics so charitable. The
      transgressions against good-breeding&mdash;the "gaucheries" of manner, the
      solecisms in dress, language, or demeanor&mdash;do indeed meet with sharp
      reproof and cutting sarcasm; but, in recompense for such severity, how
      gently do they deal with graver offences! For the felonies they can always
      discover "the attenuating circumstances;" for the petty larcenies of
      fashion they have nothing but whipcord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst the various knots where such discussions were carried on, one was
      eminently conspicuous. It was around a handsome open carriage, whose
      horses, harnessing, and liveries were all in the most perfect taste. The
      equipage might possibly have been deemed showy in Hyde Park; but in the
      Bois de Boulogne or the Cascine it must be pronounced the acme of
      elegance. Whatever might have been the differences of national opinion on
      this point, there could assuredly have been none as to the beauty of those
      who occupied it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though a considerable interval of years divided them, the aunt and her
      niece had a wonderful resemblance to each other. They were both&mdash;the
      rarest of all forms of beauty&mdash;blond Italians; that is, with light
      hair and soft gray eyes. They had a peculiar tint of skin, deeper and
      mellower than we see in Northern lands, and an expression of mingled
      seriousness and softness that only pertains to the South of Europe. There
      was a certain coquetry in the similarity of their dress, which in many
      parts was precisely alike; and although the niece was but fifteen, and the
      aunt above thirty, it needed not the aid of flattery to make many mistake
      one for the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauty, like all other "Beaux Arts," has its distinctions. The same public
      opinion that enthrones the sculptor or the musician, confers its crown on
      female loveliness; and by this acclaim were they declared Queens of
      Beauty. To any one visiting Italy for the first time, there would have
      seemed something very strange in the sort of homage rendered them: a
      reverence and respect only accorded elsewhere to royalties,&mdash;a
      deference that verged on actual humiliation,&mdash;and yet all this
      blended with a subtle familiarity that none but an Italian can ever attain
      to. The uncovered head, the attitude of respectful attention, the patient
      expectancy of notice, the glad air of him under recognition, were all
      there; and yet, through these, there was dashed a strange tone of
      intimacy, as though the observances were but a thin crust over deeper
      feelings. "La Contessa"&mdash;for she was especially "the Countess," as
      one illustrious man of our own country was "the Duke"&mdash;possessed
      every gift which claims preeminence in this fair city. She was eminently
      beautiful, young, charming in her manners, with ample fortune; and,
      lastly,&mdash;ah! good reader, you would surely be puzzled to supply that
      "lastly," the more as we say that in it lies an excellence without which
      all the rest are of little worth, and yet with it are objects of worship,
      almost of adoration,&mdash;she was&mdash;separated from her husband! There
      must have been an epidemic, a kind of rot, among husbands at one period;
      for we scarcely remember a very pretty woman, from five-and-twenty to
      five-and-thirty, who had not been obliged to leave hers from acts of
      cruelty or acts of brutality, etc., that only husbands are capable of, or
      of which their poor wives are ever the victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the moral geography of Europe be ever written, the region south of the
      Alps will certainly be colored with that tint, whatever it be, that
      describes the blessedness of a divorced existence. In other lands,
      especially in our own, the separated individual labors under no common
      difficulty in his advances to society. The story&mdash;there must be a
      story&mdash;of his separation is told in various ways, all, of course, to
      his disparagement. Tyrant or victim, it is hard to say under which title
      he comes out best,&mdash;so much for the man; but for the woman there is
      no plea: judgment is pronounced at once, without the merits. Fugitive, or
      fled from,&mdash;who inquires? she is one that few men dare to recognize.
      The very fact that to mention her name exacts an explanation, is
      condemnatory. What a boon to all such must it be that there is a climate
      mild enough for their malady, and a country that will suit their
      constitution; and not only that, but a region which actually pays homage
      to their infirmity, and makes of their martyrdom a triumph! As you go to
      Norway for salmon-fishing,&mdash;to Bengal to hunt tigers,&mdash;to St.
      Petersburg to eat caviare, so when divorced, if you really know the
      blessing of your state, go take a house on the Arno. Vast as are the
      material resources of our globe, the moral ones are infinitely greater;
      nor need we despair, some day or other, of finding an island where a
      certificate of fraudulent bankruptcy will be deemed a letter of credit,
      and an evidence of insolvency be accepted as qualification to open a bank.

      La Contessa inhabited a splendid palace, furnished with magnificence; her
      gardens were one of the sights of the capital, not only for their floral
      display, but that they contained a celebrated group by Canova, of which no
      copy existed. Her gallery was, if not extensive, enriched with some
      priceless treasures of art; and with all these she possessed high rank,
      for her card bore the name of La Comtesse de Glencore, née Comtesse della
      Torre.

      The reader thus knows at once, if not actually as much as we do ourselves,
      all that we mean to impart to him; and now let us come back to that
      equipage around which swarmed the fashion of Florence, eagerly pressing
      forward to catch a word, a smile, or even a look, and actually perched on
      every spot from which they could obtain a glimpse of those within. A young
      Russian Prince, with his arm in a sling, had just recited the incident of
      his' late duel; a Neapolitan Minister had delivered a rose-colored epistle
      from a Royal Highness of his own court. A Spanish Grandee had deposited
      his offering of camellias, which actually covered the front cushions of
      the carriage; and now a little lane was formed for the approach of the old
      Duke de Brignolles, who made his advance with a mingled courtesy and
      haughtiness that told of Versailles and long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very creditable specimen of the old <i>noblesse</i> of France was the
      Duke, and well worthy to be the grandson of one who was Grand Maréchal to
      Louis XIV. Tall, thin, and slightly stooped from age, his dark eye seemed
      to glisten the brighter beneath his shaggy white eyebrows. He had served
      with distinction as a soldier, and been an ambassador at the court of the
      Czar Paul; in every station he had filled sustaining the character of a
      true and loyal gentleman,&mdash;a man who could reflect nothing but honor
      upon the great country he belonged to. It was amongst the scandal of
      Florence that he was the most devoted of La Contessa's admirers; but we
      are quite willing to believe that his admiration had nothing in it of
      love. At all events, she distinguished him by her most marked notice. He
      was the frequent guest of her choicest dinners, and the constant visitor
      at her evenings at home. It was, then, with a degree of favor that many an
      envious heart coveted, she extended her hand to him as he came forward,
      which he kissed with all the lowly deference he would have shown to that
      of his prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mon cher Duc</i>" said she, smiling, "I have such a store of
      grievances to lay at your door. The essence of violets is not violets, but
      verbena."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charming Comtesse, I had it direct from Pierrot's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pierrot is a traitor, then, that's all; and where's Ida's Arab? is he to
      be here to-day, or to-morrow? When are we to see him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I only wrote to the Emir on Tuesday last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mais à quoi bon l'Emir</i> if he can't do impossibilities? Surely the
      very thought of him brings up the Arabian Nights and the Calif Haroun. By
      the way, thank you for the poignard. It is true Damascus, is it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. I 'd not have dared&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure not. I told the Archduchess it was. I wore it in my Turkish
      dress on Wednesday, and you, false man, would n't come to admire me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know what a sad day was that for me, madam," said he, solemnly. "It
      was the anniversary of her fate who was your only rival in beauty, as she
      had no rival in undeserved misfortunes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Pauvre Reine!</i>" sighed the Countess, and held her bouquet to her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What great mass of papers is that you have there, Duke?" resumed she.
      "Can it be a journal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is an English newspaper, my dear Countess. As I know you do not
      receive any of his countrymen, I have not asked your permission to present
      the Lord Selby; but hearing him read out your name in a paragraph here, I
      carried off his paper to have it translated for me. You read English,
      don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very imperfectly, and I detest it," said she, impatiently; "but Prince
      Volkoffsky can, I am sure, oblige you." And she turned away her head, in
      ill humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is here somewhere. <i>Parbleu</i>, I thought I marked the place,"
      muttered the Duke, as he handed the paper to the Russian. "Is n't that
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is all about theatres,&mdash;Madame Pasta and the Haymarket."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! well, it is lower down; here, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Court news. The Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; not that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, here it is. 'Great Scandal in High Life.&mdash;A very singular
      correspondence has just passed, and will soon, we believe, be made public,
      between the Heralds' College and Lord Glencore.'" Here the reader stopped,
      and lowered his voice at the next word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Read on, Prince. <i>C'est mon mari</i>," said she, coldly, while a very
      slight movement of her upper lip betrayed what might mean scorn or sorrow,
      or even both.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince, however, had now run his eyes over the paragraph, and crushing
      the newspaper in his hand, hurried away from the spot. The Duke as quickly
      followed, and soon overtook him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who gave you this paper, Duke?" cried the Russian, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was Lord Selby. He was reading it aloud to a friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then he is an <i>infame!</i> and I 'll tell him so," cried the other,
      passionately. "Which is he? the one with the light moustache, or the
      shorter one?" And, without waiting for reply, the Russian dashed between
      the carriages, and thrusting his way through the prancing crowd of moving
      horses, arrived at a spot where two young men, evidently strangers to the
      scene, were standing, calmly surveying the bright panorama before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Lord Selby," said the Russian, taking off his hat and saluting one of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's his Lordship," replied the one he addressed, pointing to his
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am the Prince Volkoffsky, aide-de-camp to the Emperor," said the
      Russian; "and hearing from my friend the Duke de Brignolles that you have
      just given him this newspaper, that he might obtain the translation of a
      passage in it which concerns Lady Glencore, and have the explanation read
      out at her own carriage, publicly, before all the world, I desire to tell
      you that your Lordship is unworthy of your rank; that you are an <i>infame!</i>
      and if you do not resent this, a <i>polisson!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This man is mad, Selby," said the short man, with the coolest air
      imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite sane enough to give your friend a lesson in good manners; and you
      too, sir, if you have any fancy for it," said the Russian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd give him in charge to the police, by Jove! if there were police
      here," said the same one who spoke before; "he can't be a gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There 's my card, sir," said the Russian; "and for you too, sir," said
      he, presenting another to him who spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you to be heard of?" said the short man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the Russian legation," said the Prince, haughtily, and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're wrong, Baynton, he is a gentleman," said Lord Selby, as he
      pocketed the card, "though certainly he is not a very mild-tempered
      specimen of his order."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did n't give the newspaper as he said&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing of the kind. I was reading it aloud to you when the royal
      carriages came suddenly past; and, in taking off my hat to salute, I never
      noticed that the old Duke had carried off the paper. I know he can't read
      English, and the chances are, he has asked this Scythian gentleman to
      interpret for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, then, the affair is easily settled," said the other, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course it is," was the answer; and they both lounged about among the
      carriages, which already were thinning, and, after a while, set out
      towards the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had but just reached the hotel, when a stranger presented himself to
      them as the Count de Marny. He had come as the friend of Prince
      Volkoffsky, who had fully explained to him the event of that afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Baynton, "we are of opinion your friend has conducted himself
      exceedingly ill, and we are here to receive his excuses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid, messieurs," said the Frenchman, bowing, "that it will
      exhaust your patience if you continue to wait for them. Might it not be
      better to come and accept what he is quite prepared to offer you,&mdash;satisfaction?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so," said Lord Selby: "he 'll see his mistake some time or other,
      and perhaps regret it. Where shall it be?&mdash;and when?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the Fossombroni Villa, about two miles from this. To-morrow morning,
      at eight, if that suit you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite well. I have no other appointment. Pistols, of course?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have the choice, otherwise my friend would have preferred the sword."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take him at his word, Selby," whispered Baynton; "you are equal to any of
      them with the rapier."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If your friend desire the sword, I have no objection,&mdash;I mean the
      rapier."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The rapier be it," said the Frenchman; and with a polite assurance of the
      infinite honor he felt in forming their acquaintance, and the gratifying
      certainty that they were sure to possess of his highest consideration, he
      bowed, backed, and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well-mannered fellow, the Frenchman," said Baynton, as the door closed;
      and the other nodded assent, and rang the bell for dinner.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. THE VILLA FOSSOMBRONI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The grounds of the Villa Fossombroni were, at the time we speak of, the
      Chalk Farm, or the Fifteen Acres of Tuscany. The villa itself, long since
      deserted by the illustrious family whose name it bore, had fallen into the
      hands of an old Pied-montese noble, ruined by a long life of excess and
      dissipation. He had served with gallantry in the imperial army of France,
      but was dismissed the service for a play transaction in which his conduct
      was deeply disgraceful; and the Colonel Count Tasseroni, of the 8th
      Hussars of the Guards, was declared unworthy to wear the uniform of a
      Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a number of years he had lived so estranged from the world that many
      believed he had died; but at last it was known that he had gone to reside
      in a half-ruined villa near Florence, which soon became the resort of a
      certain class of gamblers whose habits would have speedily attracted
      notice if practised within the city. The quarrels and altercations, so
      inseparable from high play, were usually settled on the spot in which they
      occurred, until at last the villa became famous for these meetings, and
      the name of Fossombroni, in a discussion, was the watchword for a duel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was of a splendid spring morning that the two Englishmen arrived at
      this spot, which, even on the unpleasant errand that they had come, struck
      them with surprise and admiration. The villa itself was one of those vast
      structures which the country about Florence abounds in. Gloomy, stern, and
      jail-like without, while within, splendid apartments opened into each
      other in what seems an endless succession. Frescoed walls and gorgeously
      ornamented ceilings, gilded mouldings and rich tracery, were on every
      side; and these, too, in chambers where the immense proportions and the
      vast space recalled the idea of a royal residence. Passing in by a
      dilapidated "grille" which once had been richly gilded, they entered by a
      flight of steps a great hall which ran the entire length of the building.
      Though lighted by a double range of windows, neglect and dirt had so
      dimmed the panes that the place was almost in deep shadow. Still, they
      could perceive that the vaulted roof was a mass of stuccoed tracery, and
      that the colossal divisions of the wall were of brilliant Sienna marble.
      At one end of this great gallery was a small chapel, now partly despoiled
      of its religious decorations, which were most irreverently replaced by a
      variety of swords and sabres of every possible size and shape, and several
      pairs of pistols, arranged with an evident eye to picturesque grouping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are all these inscriptions here on the walls, Baynton?" cried Selby,
      as he stood endeavoring to decipher the lines on a little marble slab, a
      number of which were dotted over the chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strange enough this, by Jove!" muttered the other, reading to himself,
      half aloud, "'Francesco Ricordi, ucciso da Gieronimo Gazzi, 29 Settembre,
      1818.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does that mean?" asked Selby.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is to commemorate some fellow who was killed here in '18."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they all in the same vein?" asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would seem so. Here 's one: 'Gravamente ferito,'&mdash;badly wounded;
      with a postscript that he died the same night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's this large one here, in black marble?" inquired Selby.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the memory of Carlo Luigi Guiccidrini, 'detto il Carnefice,' called
      'the slaughterer:' cut down to the forehead by Pietro Baldasseroni, on the
      night of July 8th, 1819."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I confess any other kind of literature would amuse me as well," said
      Selby, turning back again into the large hall. Baynton had scarcely joined
      him when they saw advancing towards them through the gloom a short,
      thickset man, dressed in a much-worn dressing-gown and slippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He removed his skull-cap as he approached, and said, "The Count Tasseroni,
      at your orders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have come here by appointment," said Baynton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes. I know it all. Volkoffsky sent me word. He was here on
      Saturday. He gave that French colonel a sharp lesson. Ran the sword clean
      through the chest. To be sure, he was wounded too, but only through the
      arm; but 'La Marque' has got his passport."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll have him up there soon, then," said Baynton, pointing towards the
      chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think not. We have not done it latterly," said the Count, musingly.
      "The authorities don't seem to like it; and, of course, we respect the
      authorities!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's quite evident," said Baynton, who turned to translate the
      observation to his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Selby whispered a word in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does the signore say?" inquired the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend thinks that they are behind the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Per Baccho!</i> Let him be easy as to that. I have known some to think
      that the Russian came too soon. I never heard of one who wished him
      earlier! There they are now: they always come by the garden." And so
      saying, he hastened off to receive them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is this fellow to handle a sword, if his right arm be wounded?" said
      Selby.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you know that these Russians use the left hand indifferently with
      the right, in all exercises? It may be awkward for <i>you</i>; but, depend
      upon it, <i>he'll</i> not be inconvenienced in the least."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the others entered the other end of the hall. The Prince no
      sooner saw the Englishmen than he advanced towards them with his hat off.
      "My lord," said he, rapidly, "I have come to make you an apology, and one
      which I trust you will accept in all the frankness that I offer it. I have
      learned from your friend the Duc de Brignolles how the incident of
      yesterday occurred. I see that the only fault committed was my own. Will
      you pardon, then, a momentary word of ill-temper, occasioned by what I
      wrongfully believed to be a great injury?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, I knew it was all a mistake on your part. I told Colonel
      Baynton, here, you'd see so yourself,&mdash;when it is too late, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you sincerely," said the Russian, bowing; "your readiness to
      accord me this satisfaction makes your forgiveness more precious to me.
      And now, as another favor, will you permit me to ask you one question?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, when you could have so easily explained this misconception on my
      part, did you not take the trouble of doing so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Selby looked confused, blushed, looked awkwardly from side to side, and
      then, with a glance towards his friend, seemed to say, "Will you try and
      answer him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you have hit it yourself, Prince," said Baynton. "It was the
      trouble, the bore of an explanation, deterred him. He hates writing, and
      he thought there would be a shower of notes to be replied to, meetings,
      discussions, and what not; and so he said, 'Let him have his shot, and
      have done with it.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Russian looked from one to the other as he listened, and seemed really
      as if not quite sure whether this speech was uttered in seriousness or
      sarcasm. The calm, phlegmatic faces of the Englishmen,&mdash;the almost
      apathetic expression they wore,&mdash;soon convinced him that the words
      were truthfully spoken; and he stood actually confounded with amazement
      before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Selby and his friend freely accepted the polite invitation of the
      Prince to breakfast, and they all adjourned to a small but splendidly
      decorated room, where everything was already awaiting them. There are few
      incidents in life which so much predispose to rapid intimacy as the case
      of an averted duel. The revulsion from animosity is almost certain to lead
      to, if not actual friendship, what may easily become so. In the present
      instance, the very diversities of national character gave a zest and
      enjoyment to the meeting; and while the Englishmen were charmed by the
      fascination of manners and conversational readiness of their hosts, the
      Russians were equally struck with a cool imperturbability and
      impassiveness, of which they had never seen the equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees the Russian led the conversation to the question by which their
      misunderstanding originated. "You know my Lord Glencore, perhaps?" said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never saw, scarcely ever heard of him," said Selby, in his dry, laconic
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he mad, or a fool?" asked the Prince, half angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I served in a regiment once where he commanded a troop," said Baynton;
      "and they always said he was a good sort of fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You read that paragraph this morning, I conclude?" said the Russian. "You
      saw how he dares to stigmatize the honor of his wife,&mdash;to degrade her
      to the rank of a mistress,&mdash;and, at the same time, to bastardize the
      son who ought to inherit his rank and title?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I read it," said Selby, dryly; "and I had a letter from my lawyer about
      it this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" exclaimed he, anxious to hear more, and yet too delicate to
      venture on a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; he writes to me for some title-deeds or other. I did n't pay much
      attention, exactly, to what he says. Glen-core's man of business had
      addressed a letter to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Russian bowed, and waited for him to resume; but, apparently, he had
      rather fatigued himself by such unusual loquacity, and so he lay back in
      his chair, and puffed his cigar in indolent enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A goodish sort of thing for <i>you</i> it ought to be," said Baynton,
      between the puffs of his tobacco smoke, and with a look towards Selby.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suspect it may," said the other, without the slightest change of tone
      or demeanor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is it,&mdash;somewhere in the south?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mostly, Devon. There's something in Wales too, if I remember aright."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing Irish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank Heaven,&mdash;nothing Irish;" and his grim Lordship made the
      nearest advance to a smile of which his unplastic features seemed capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I understand you aright, my Lord," said the Prince, "that you receive
      an accession of fortune by this event?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall, if I survive Glencore," was the brief reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are related, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some cousinship,&mdash;I forget how it is. Do you remember, Baynton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not quite certain. I think it was a Coventry married one of Jack
      Conway's sisters, and she afterwards became the wife of Sir something
      Massy. Isn't that it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's it," muttered the other, in the tone of a man who was tired
      of a knotty problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, according to your laws, this Lord Glencore may marry again?" cried
      the Russian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think so, if he has no wife living," said Selby; "but I trust,
      for <i>my</i> sake, he'll not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what if he should, and should be discovered the wedded husband of
      another?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would be bigamy," said Selby. "Would they hang him, Baynton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think not,&mdash;scarcely," rejoined the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince tried in various ways to obtain some insight into Lord
      Glencore's habits, his tastes and mode of life, but all in vain. They
      knew, indeed, very little, but even that little they were too indolent to
      repeat. Lord Selby's memory was often at fault, too, and Baynton's had ill
      supplied the deficiency. Again and again did the Russian mutter curses to
      himself over the apathy of these stony islanders. At moments he fancied
      that they suspected his eagerness, and had assumed their most guarded
      caution against him; but he soon perceived that this manner was natural to
      them, not prompted in the slightest degree by any distrust whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all," thought the Russian, "how can I hope to stimulate a man who
      is not excited by his own increase of fortune? Talk of Turkish fatalism,
      these fellows would shame the Moslem."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to prolong your stay at Florence, my Lord?" asked the Prince,
      as they arose from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I scarcely know. What do you say, Baynton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A week or so, I fancy," muttered the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then on to Rome, perhaps?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The two Englishmen looked at each other with an air of as much confusion
      as if subjected to a searching examination in science.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I shouldn't wonder," said Selby, at last, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it may come to that," said Baynton, like a man who had just overcome
      a difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 'll be in time for the Holy Week and all the ceremonies," said the
      Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mind that, Baynton," said his Lordship, who wasn't going to carry what he
      felt to be another man's load; and Baynton nodded acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And after that comes the season for Naples,&mdash;you have a month or six
      weeks, perhaps, of such weather as nothing in all Europe can vie with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hear, Baynton!" said Selby.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've booked it," muttered the other; and so they took leave of their
      entertainer, and set out towards Florence. Neither you nor I, dear reader,
      will gain anything by keeping them company, for they say scarcely a word
      by the way. They stop at intervals, and cast their eyes over the glorious
      landscape at their feet. Their glances are thrown over the fairest scene
      of the fairest of all lands; and whether they turn towards the snow-capt
      Apennines, by Vall'ombrosa, or trace the sunny vineyards along the Val' d'
      Arno, they behold a picture such as no canvas ever imitated; still, they
      are mute and uncommunicative. Whatever of pleasure their thoughts suggest,
      each keeps for himself. Objects of wonder, strange sights and new, may
      present themselves, but they are not to be startled out of national
      dignity by so ignoble a sentiment as surprise. And so they jog onward,&mdash;doubtless
      richer in reflection than eloquent in communion; and so we leave them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us not be deemed unjust or ungenerous if we assert that we have met
      many such as these. They are not individuals,&mdash;they are a class; and,
      strange enough too, a class which almost invariably pertains to a high and
      distinguished rank in society. It would be presumptuous to ascribe such
      demeanor to insensibility. There is enough in their general conduct to
      disprove the assumption. As little is it affectation; it is simply an
      acquired habit of stoical indifference, supposed to be&mdash;why, Heaven
      knows!&mdash;the essential ingredient of the best breeding. If the
      practice extinguish all emotion, and obliterate all trace of feeling from
      the heart, we deplore the system. If it only gloss over the working of
      human sympathy, we pity the men. At all events, they are very
      uninteresting company, with whom longer dalliance would only be wearisome.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. SOME TRAITS OF LIFE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the night Lady Glencore received; and, as usual, the street was
      crowded with equipages, which somehow seemed to have got into inextricable
      confusion,&mdash;some endeavoring to turn back, while others pressed
      forward,&mdash;the court of the palace being closely packed with carriages
      which the thronged street held in fast blockade. As the apartments which
      faced the street were not ever used for these receptions, the dark
      unlighted windows suggested no remark; but they who had entered the
      courtyard were struck by the gloomy aspect of the vast building: not only
      that the entrance and the stairs were in darkness, but the whole suite of
      rooms, usually brilliant as the day, were now in deep gloom. From every
      carriage window heads were protruded, wondering at this strange spectacle;
      and eager inquiries passed on every side for an explanation. The
      explanation of "sudden illness" was rapidly disseminated, but as rapidly
      contradicted, and the reply given by the porter to all demands quickly
      repeated from mouth to mouth, "Her Ladyship will not receive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can no one explain this mystery?" cried the old Princess Borinsky, as,
      heavy with fat and diamonds, she hung out of her carriage window. "Oh,
      there 's Major Scaresby; he is certain to know, if it be anything
      malicious."
    </p>
    <p>
      Scaresby was, however, too busy in recounting his news to others to
      perceive the signals the old Princess held out; and it was only as her
      chasseur, six feet three of green and gold, bent down to give her
      Highness's message, that the Major hurried off, in all the importance of a
      momentary scandal, to the side of her carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here I am, all impatience. What is it, Scaresby? Tell me quickly," cried
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A smash, my dear Princess,&mdash;nothing more or less," said he, in a
      voice which nature seemed to have invented to utter impertinences, so
      harsh and grating, and yet so painfully distinct in all its accents,&mdash;"as
      complete a smash as ever I heard of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't mean that her fortune is in peril?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose that must suffer also. It is her character&mdash;her station as
      one of us&mdash;that's shipwrecked here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on, go on," cried she, impatiently; "I wish to hear it all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All is very briefly related, then," said he. "The charming Countess, you
      remember, ran away with a countryman of mine, young Glencore, of the 8th
      Hussars; I used to know his father intimately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind his father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That 's exactly what Glencore did. He came over here and fell in love
      with the girl, and they ran off together; but they forgot to get married,
      Princess. Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!" And he laughed with a cackle a demon
      could not have rivalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe a word of it,&mdash;I'll never believe it," cried the
      Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's exactly what I was recommending to the Mar-quesa Guesteni. I said,
      you need n't believe it. Why, how do we go anywhere, nowadays, except by
      'not believing' the evil stories that are told of our entertainers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes; but I repeat that this is an infamous calumny. She, a Countess,
      of a family second to none in all Italy; her father a Grand d'Espagne. I
      'll go to her this moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She'll not see you. She has just refused to see La Genori," said the
      Major, tartly. "Though, if a cracked reputation might have afforded any
      sympathy, she might have admitted <i>her</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is to be done?" exclaimed the Princess, sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just what you suggested a few moments ago,&mdash;don't believe it. Hang
      me, but good houses and good cooks are growing too scarce to make one
      credulous of the ills that can be said of their owners."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I knew what course to take," muttered the Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you, then. Get half a dozen of your own set together to-morrow
      morning, vote the whole story an atrocious falsehood, and go in a body and
      tell the Countess your mind. You know as well as I, Princess, that social
      credit is as great a bubble as commercial; we should all of us be
      bankrupts if our books were seen. Ay, by Jove! and the similitude goes
      farther too; for when one old established house breaks, there is generally
      a crash in the whole community around it."
    </p>
    <p>
      While they thus talked, a knot had gathered around the carriage, all eager
      to hear what opinion the Princess had formed on the catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Various were the sentiments expressed by the different speakers,&mdash;some
      sorrowfully deploring the disaster; others more eagerly inveighing against
      the infamy of the man who had proclaimed it. Many declared that they had
      come to the determination to discredit the story. Not one, however,
      sincerely professed that he disbelieved it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can it be, as the French moralist asserts, that we have a latent sense of
      satisfaction in the misfortunes of even our best friends; or is it, as we
      rather suspect, that true friendship is a rarer thing than is commonly
      believed, and has little to do with those conventional intimacies which so
      often bear its name?
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuredly of all this well-bred, well-dressed, and wellborn company, now
      thronging the courtyard of the palace and the street in front of it, the
      tone was as much sarcasm as sorrow, and many a witty epigram and smart
      speech were launched over a disaster which might have been spared such
      levity. At length the space slowly began to thin. Slowly carriage after
      carriage drove off,&mdash;the heaviest grief of their occupants often
      being over a lost <i>soirée</i>, an unprofited occasion to display
      toilette and jewels; while a few, more reflective, discussed what course
      was to be followed in future, and what recognition extended to the victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Florence sat in committee over the lost Countess. Witnesses
      were heard and evidence taken as to her case. They all agreed it was a
      great hardship,&mdash;a terrible calamity; but still, if true, what could
      be done?
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was there a society less ungenerously prudish, and yet there were
      cases&mdash;this, one of them&mdash;which transgressed all conventional
      rule. Like a crime which no statute had ever contemplated, it stood out
      self-accused and self-condemned. A few might, perhaps, have been merciful,
      but they were overborne by numbers. Lady Glencore's beauty and her vast
      fortune were now counts in the indictment against her, and many a jealous
      rival was not sorry at this hour of humiliation. The despotism of beauty
      is not a very mild sway, after all; and perhaps the Countess had exercised
      her rule right royally. At all events, it was the young and the
      good-looking who voted her exclusion, and only those who could not enter
      into competition with her charms who took the charitable side. They
      discussed and debated the question all day; but while they hesitated over
      the reprieve, the prisoner was beyond the law. The gate of the palace,
      locked and barred all day, refused entrance to every one; at night, it
      opened to admit the exit of a travelling-carriage. The next morning large
      bills of sale, posted over the walls, declared that all the furniture and
      decorations-were to be sold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Countess had left Florence, none knew whither.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must really have those large Sèvres jars," said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I, the small park phaeton," cried another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope she has not taken Horace with her; he was the best cook in Italy.
      Splendid hock she had,&mdash;I wonder is there much of it left?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish we were certain of another bad reputation to replace her," grunted
      out Scaresby; "they are the only kind of people who give good dinners, and
      never ask for returns."
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus these dear friends&mdash;guests of a hundred brilliant fêtes&mdash;discussed
      the fall of her they once had worshipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may seem small-minded and narrow to stigmatize such conduct as this.
      Some may say that for the ordinary courtesies of society no pledges of
      friendship are required, no real gratitude incurred. Be it so. Still, the
      revulsion, from habits of deference and respect, to disparagement, and
      even sarcasm, is a sorry evidence of human kindness; and the threshold,
      over which for years we had only passed as guests, might well suggest
      sadder thoughts as we tread it to behold desolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair Countess had been the celebrity of that city for many a day. The
      stranger of distinction sought her, as much as a matter of course as he
      sought presentation to the sovereign. Her <i>salons</i> had the double
      eminence of brilliancy in rank and brilliancy in wit; her entertainments
      were cited as models of elegance and refinement; and now she was gone! The
      extreme of regret that followed her was the sorrow of those who were to
      dine there no more; the grief of him who thought he should never have a
      house like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The respectable vagabonds of society are a large family, much larger than
      is usually supposed. They are often well born, almost always well
      mannered, invariably well dressed. They do not, at first blush, appear to
      discharge any very great or necessary function in life; but we must by no
      means, from that, infer their inutility. Naturalists tell us that several
      varieties of insect existence we rashly set down as mere annoyances, have
      their peculiar spheres of usefulness and good; and, doubtless, these same
      loungers contribute in some mysterious manner to the welfare of that state
      which they only seem to burden. We are told that but for flies, for
      instance, we should be infested with myriads of winged tormentors,
      insinuating themselves into our meat and drink, and rendering life
      miserable. Is there not something very similar performed by the
      respectable class I allude to? Are they not invariably devouring and
      destroying some vermin a little smaller than themselves, and making thus a
      healthier atmosphere for their betters? If good society only knew the debt
      it owes to these defenders of its privileges, a "Vagabonds' Home and Aged
      Asylum" would speedily figure amongst bur national charities.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have been led to these thoughts by observing how distinctly different
      was Major Scaresby's tone in talking of the Countess when he addressed his
      betters or spoke in his own class. To the former he gave vent to all his
      sarcasm and bitterness; they liked it just because they would n't
      condescend to it themselves. To his own he put on the bullying air of one
      who said, "How should <i>you</i> possibly know what vices such great
      people have, any more than you know what they have for dinner? <i>I</i>
      live amongst them,&mdash;<i>I</i> understand them,&mdash;<i>I</i> am aware
      that what would be very shocking in <i>you</i> is quite permissible to <i>them</i>.
      <i>They</i> know how to be wicked; <i>you</i> only know how to be gross."
      And thus Scaresby talked, and sneered, and scoffed, making such a hash of
      good and evil, such a Maelstrom of right and wrong, that it were a subtle
      moralist who could have extracted one solitary scrap of uncontaminated
      meaning from all his muddy lucubrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, however, effected this much: he kept the memory of her who had gone,
      alive by daily calumnies. He embalmed her in poisons, each morning
      appearing with some new trait of her extravagance, till the world, grown
      sick of himself and his theme, vowed they would hear no more of either;
      and so she was forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ay, good reader, utterly forgotten! The gay world, for so it likes to be
      called, has no greater element of enjoyment amongst all its high gifts
      than its precious power of forgetting. It forgets not only all it owes to
      others,&mdash;gratitude, honor, and esteem,&mdash;but even the closer
      obligations it has contracted with itself. The Palazzo della Torre was for
      a fortnight the resort of the curious and the idle. At the sale crowds
      appeared to secure some object of especial value to each; and then the
      gates were locked, the shutters closed, and a large, ill-written notice on
      the door announced that any letters for the proprietor were to be
      addressed to "Pietro Arretini, Via del Sole."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. AN UPTONIAN DESPATCH
    </h2>
    <p>
      British Legation, Naples. My dear Harcourt,&mdash;It would seem that a
      letter of mine to you must have miscarried,&mdash;a not unfrequent
      occurrence when entrusted to our Foreign Office for transmission. Should
      it ever reach you, you will perceive how unjustly you have charged me with
      neglecting your wishes. I have ordered the Sicilian wine for your friend;
      I have obtained the Royal leave for you to shoot in Calabria; and I assure
      you it is rather a rare incident in my life to have forgotten nothing
      required of me! Perhaps you, who know me well, will do me this justice,
      and be the more grateful for my present promptitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite a mistake sending me here; for anything there is to be done,
      Spencer or Lonsdale would perfectly suffice. <i>I</i> ought to have gone
      to Vienna,&mdash;and so they know at home; but it's the old game played
      over again. Important questions! why, my dear friend, there is not a
      matter between this country and our own that rises above the capacity of a
      Colonel of Dragoons. Meanwhile really great events are preparing in the
      East of Europe,&mdash;not that I am going to inflict them upon you, nor
      ask you to listen to speculations which even those in authority turn a
      deaf ear to.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very kind of you to think of my health. I am still a sufferer; the
      old pains rather aggravated than relieved by this climate. You are aware
      that, though warm, the weather here has some exciting property, some
      excess or other of a peculiar gas in the atmosphere, prejudicial to
      certain temperaments. I feel it greatly; and though the season is
      midsummer, I am obliged to dress entirely in a light costume of buckskin,
      and take Marsalla baths, which refresh me, at least for the while. I have
      also taken to smoke the leaves of the nux vomica, steeped in arrack, and
      think it agrees with me. The King has most kindly placed a little villa at
      Ischia at my disposal; but I do not mean to avail myself of the
      politeness. The Duke of San Giustino has also offered me his palace at
      Baia; but I don't fancy leaving this just now, where there is a doctor, a
      certain Luigi Buffeloni, who really seems to have hit off my case. He
      calls it arterial arthriticis,&mdash;a kind of inflammatory action of one
      coat of the arterial system; his notion is highly ingenious, and
      wonderfully borne out by the symptoms. I wish you would ask Brodie, or any
      of our best men, whether they have met with this affection; what class it
      affects, and what course it usually takes? My Italian doctor implies that
      it is the passing malady of men highly excitable, and largely endowed with
      mental gifts. He may, or may not, be correct in this. It is only nature
      makes the blunder of giving the sharpest swords the weakest scabbards.
      What a pity the weapon cannot be worn naked!
    </p>
    <p>
      You ask me if I like this place. I do, perhaps, as well as I should like
      anywhere. There is a wonderful sameness over the world just now,
      preluding, I have very little doubt, some great outburst of nationality
      from all the countries of Europe,&mdash;just as periods of Puritanism
      succeed intervals of gross licentiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Society here is, therefore, what you see it in London or Paris; well-bred
      people, like Gold, are current everywhere. There is really little peculiar
      to observe. I don't perceive that there is more levity than elsewhere. The
      difference is, perhaps, that there is less shame about it, since it is
      under the protection of the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      I go out very little; my notion is, that the Diplomatist, like the ancient
      Augur, must not suffer himself to be vulgarized by contact. He can only
      lose, not gain, by that mixed intercourse with the world. I have a few who
      come when I want them, and go in like manner. They tell me "what is going
      on," far better and more truthfully than paid employees, and they cannot
      trace my intentions through my inquiries, and hasten off to retail them at
      the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Of my colleagues I see as little as
      possible, though, when we do meet, I feel an unbounded affection for them.
      So much for my life, dear Harcourt; on the whole, a very tolerable kind of
      existence, which if few would envy, still fewer would care to part with.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now come to the chief portion of your letter. This boy of Glencore's, I
      rather like the account you give of him, better than you do yourself.
      Imaginative and dreamy he may be, but remember what he was, and where we
      have placed him. A moonstruck, romantic youth at a German University. Is
      it not painting the lily?
    </p>
    <p>
      I merely intended he should go to Göttingen to learn the language,&mdash;always
      a difficulty, if not abstracted from other and more dulcet sounds. I never
      meant to have him domesticated with some rusty Hochgelehrter, eating
      sauer-kraut in company with a green-eyed Fraulein, and imbibing love and
      metaphysics together. Let him "moon away," as you call it, my dear
      Harcourt. It is wonderfully little consequence what any one does with his
      intellect till he be three or four and twenty. Indeed, I half suspect that
      the soil might be left quietly to rear weeds till that time; and as to
      dreaminess, it signifies nothing if there be a strong "physique." With a
      weak frame, imagination will play the tyrant, and never cease till it
      dominates over all the other faculties; but where there is strength and
      activity, there is no fear of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      You amuse me with your account of the doctor; and so the Germans have
      actually taken him for a savant, and given him a degree "honoris causa."
      May they never make a worse blunder. The man is eminently remarkable,&mdash;with
      his opportunities, miraculous. I am certain, Harcourt, you never felt half
      the pleasure on arriving at a region well stocked with game, that he did
      on finding himself in a land of Libraries, Museums, and Collections. Fancy
      the poor fellow's ecstasy at being allowed to range at will through all
      ancient literature, of which hitherto a stray volume alone had reached
      him. Imagine his delight as each day opened new stores of knowledge to
      him, surrounded as he was by all that could encourage zeal and reward
      research. The boy's treatment of him pleases me much; it smacks of the
      gentle blood in his veins. Poor lad, there is something very sad in his
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      You need not have taken such trouble about accounts and expenditure; of
      course, whatever you have done I perfectly approve of. You say that the
      boy has no idea of money or its value. There is both good and evil in
      this. And now as to his future. I should have no objection whatever to
      having him attached to my Legation here, and perhaps no great difficulty
      in effecting his appointment; but there is a serious obstacle in his
      position. The young men who figure at embassies and missions are all
      "cognate numbers." They each of them know who and what the other is,
      whence he came, and so on. Now, our poor boy could not stand this ordeal,
      nor would it be fair he should be exposed to it. Besides this, it was
      never Glencore's wish, but the very opposite to it, that he should be
      brought prominently forward in life. He even suggested one of the Colonies
      as the means of withdrawing him at once, and forever, from public gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have interested me much by what you say of the boy's progress. His
      tastes, I infer, lie in the direction which, in a worldly sense, are least
      profitable; but, after all, Harcourt, every one has brains enough, and to
      spare, for any career. Let us only decide upon that one most fitted for
      him, and, depend upon it, his faculties will day by day conform to his
      duties, and his tastes be merely dissipations, just as play or wine is to
      coarser natures.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you really press the question of his coming to me, I will not refuse,
      seeing that I can take my own time to consider what steps subsequently
      should be adopted. How is it that you know nothing of Glencore,&mdash;can
      he not be traced?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Selby, whom you may remember in the Blues formerly, dined here
      yesterday, and mentioned a communication he had received from his lawyer
      with regard to some property entail, which, if Glencore should leave no
      heir male, devolved upon him. I tried to find out the whereabouts and the
      amount of this heritage; but, with the admirable indifference that
      characterizes him, he did not know or care.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to my Lady, I can give you no information whatever. Her house at
      Florence is uninhabited, the furniture is sold off; but no one seems even
      to guess whither she has betaken herself. The fast and loose of that
      pleasant city are, as I hear, actually houseless since her departure. No
      asylum opens there with fire and cigars. A number of the destitute have
      come down here in half despair, amongst the rest Scaresby,&mdash;Major
      Scaresby, an insupportable nuisance of flat stories and stale gossip; one
      of those fellows who cannot make even malevolence amusing, and who speak
      ill of their neighbors without a single spark of wit. He has left three
      cards upon me, each duly returned; but I am resolved that our inter-change
      of courtesies shall proceed no farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      I trust I have omitted nothing in reply to your last despatch, except it
      be to say that I look for you here about September, or earlier, if as
      convenient to you; you will, of course, write to me, however, meanwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not mention having heard from me, at the clubs or in society. I am, as
      I have the right to be, on the sick list, and it is as well my rest should
      remain undisturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish you had any means of making it known that the article in the
      "Quarterly," on our Foreign relations, is not mine. The newspapers have
      coolly assumed me to be the author, and of course I am not going to give
      them the <i>éclat</i> of a personal denial. The fellow who wrote it must
      be an ass; since had he known what he pretends, he had never revealed it.
      He who wants to bag his bird, Colonel, never bangs away at nothing. I have
      now completed a longer despatch to you than I intend to address to the
      Noble Secretary at F. O., and am yours, very faithfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace Upton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whose Magnesia is it that contains essence of Bark? Tripley's or
      Chipley's, I think. Find it out for me, and send me a packet through the
      office; put up Fauchard's pamphlet with it, on Spain, and a small box of
      those new blisters,&mdash;Mouches they are called; they are to be had at
      Atkinson's. I have got so accustomed to their stimulating power that I
      never write without one or two on my forehead. They tell me the cautery,
      if dexterously applied, is better; but I have not tried it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. THE TUTOR AND HIS PUPIL
    </h2>
    <p>
      We are not about to follow up the correspondence of Sir Horace by
      detailing the reply which Harcourt sent, and all that thereupon ensued
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We pass over, then, some months of time, and arrive at the late autumn.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a calm, still morning; the sea, streaked with tinted shadows, is
      without a ripple; the ships of many nations that float on it are
      motionless, their white sails hung out to bleach, their ensigns drooping
      beside the masts. Over the summit of Vesuvius&mdash;for we are at Naples&mdash;a
      light blue cloud hangs, the solitary one in all the sky. A mild, plaintive
      song, the chant of some fishermen on the rocks, is the only sound, save
      the continuous hum of that vast city, which swells and falls at intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close beside the sea, seated on a rock, are two figures. One is that of a
      youth of some eighteen or nineteen years; his features, eminently
      handsome, wear an expression of gloomy pride as in deep preoccupation he
      gazes out over the bay; to all seeming, indifferent to the fair scene
      before him, and wrapped in his own sad thoughts. The other is a short,
      square-built, almost uncouth figure, overshadowed by a wide straw hat,
      which seems even to diminish his stature; a suit of black, wide and ample
      enough for one twice his size, gives his appearance a grotesqueness to
      which his features contribute their share.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, indeed, a strange physiognomy, to which Celt and Calmuc seem
      equally to contribute. The low, overhanging forehead, the intensely keen
      eye, sparkling with an almost imp-like drollery, are contrasted by a
      firmly compressed mouth and a far-projecting under-jaw that imply
      sternness even to cruelty; a mass of waving black hair, that covers neck
      and shoulders, adds a species of savagery to a head which assuredly has no
      need of such aid. Bent down over a large quarto volume, he never lifts his
      eyes; but, intently occupied, his lips are rapidly repeating the words as
      he reads them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to pass the morning here?" asks the youth, at length, "or
      where shall I find you later on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll do whatever you like best," said the other, in a rich brogue; "I 'm
      agreeable to go or stay,&mdash;<i>ad utrumque pa-ratus</i>." And Billy
      Traynor, for it was he, shut up his venerable volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't wish to disturb you," said the boy, mildly, "you can read. I
      cannot; I have a fretful, impatient feeling over me that perhaps will go
      off with exercise. I'll set out, then, for a walk, and come back here
      towards evening, then go and dine at the Rocca, and afterwards whatever
      you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you say that, then," said Billy, in a voice of evident delight, "we'll
      finish the day at the Professor Tadeucci's, and get him to go over that
      analysis again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no taste for chemistry. It always seems to me to end where it
      began," said the boy, impatiently. "Where do all researches tend to? how
      are you elevated in intellect? how are your thoughts higher, wider,
      nobler, by all these mixings and manipulations?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it nothing to know how thunder and lightning is made; to understand
      electricity; to dive into the secrets of that old crater there, and see
      the ingredients in the crucible that was bilin' three thousand years ago?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "These things appeal more grandly to my imagination when the mystery of
      their forces is unrevealed. I like to think of them as dread
      manifestations of a mighty will, rather than gaseous combinations or
      metallic affinities."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what prevents you?" said Billy, eagerly. "Is the grandeur of the
      phenomenon impaired because it is in part intelligible? Ain't you elevated
      as a reasoning being when you get what I may call a peep into God's
      workshop, rather than by implicitly accepting results just as any old
      woman accepts a superstition?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is something ignoble in mechanism," said the boy, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't say that, while your heart is beatin' and your arteries is
      contractin; never say it as long as your lungs dilate or collapse. It's
      mechanism makes water burst out of the ground, and, swelling into streams,
      flow as mighty rivers through the earth. It's mechanism raises the sap to
      the topmost bough of the cedar-tree that waves over Lebanon. 'T is the
      same power moves planets above, just to show us that as there is nothing
      without a cause, there is one great and final 'Cause' behind all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And will you tell me," said the boy, sneeringly, "that a sunbeam pours
      more gladness into your heart because a prism has explained to you the
      composition of light?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God's blessings never seemed the less to me because he taught me the
      beautiful laws that guide them," said Billy, reverently; "every little
      step that I take out of darkness is on the road, at least, to Him."
    </p>
    <p>
      In part abashed by the words, in part admonished by the tone of the
      speaker, the boy was silent for some minutes. "You know, Billy," said he,
      at length, "that I spoke in no irreverence; that I would no more insult
      your convictions than I would outrage my own. It is simply that it suits
      my dreamy indolence to like the wonderful better than the intelligible;
      and you must acknowledge that there never was so palatable a theory for
      ignorance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, but I don't want you to be ignorant," said Billy, earnestly; "and
      there's no greater mistake than supposing that knowledge is an impediment
      to the play of fancy. Take my word for it, Master Charles, imagination, no
      more than any one else, does not work best in the dark."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly am no adept under such circumstances," said the boy. "I have
      n't told you what happened me in the studio last night. I went in without
      a candle, and, trying to grope my way to the table, I overturned the large
      olive jar, full of clay, against my Niobe, and smashed her to atoms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Smashed Niobe!" cried Billy, in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In pieces. I stood over her sadder than ever she felt herself, and I have
      not had the courage to enter the studio since."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, let us see if she couldn't be restored," said Billy, rising.
      "Let us go down there together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may, if you have any fancy,&mdash;there's the key," said the boy. "I
      'll return there no more till the rubbish be cleared away." And so saying,
      he moved off, and was soon out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deeply grieving over this disaster, Billy Traynor hastened from the spot,
      but he had only reached the garden of the Chiaja when he heard a faint,
      weak voice calling him by his name; he turned, and saw Sir Horace Upton,
      who, seated in a sort of portable arm-chair, was enjoying the fresh air
      from the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite a piece of good fortune to meet you, Doctor," said he, smiling;
      "neither you nor your pupil have been near me for ten days or more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis our own loss then, your Excellency," said Billy, bowing; "even a
      chance few minutes in your company is like whetting the intellectual
      razor,&mdash;I feel myself sharper for the whole day after."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why not come oftener, man? Are you afraid of wearing the steel all
      away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'T is more afraid I am of gapping the fine edge of your Excellency by
      contact with my own ruggedness," said Billy, obsequiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were intended for a courtier, Doctor," said Sir Horace, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there was such a thing as a court fool nowadays, I'd look for the
      place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The age is too dull for such a functionary. They'll not find ten men in
      any country of Europe equal to the office," said Sir Horace. "One has only
      to see how lamentably dull are the journals dedicated to wit and drollery,
      to admit this fact; though written by many hands, how rare it is to chance
      upon what provokes a laugh. You 'll have fifty metaphysicians anywhere
      before you 'll hit on one Molière. Will you kindly open that umbrella for
      me? This autumnal sun, they say, gives sunstroke. And now what do you
      think of this boy? He'll not make a diplomatist, that's clear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He 'll not make anything,&mdash;just for one simple reason, because he
      could be whatever he pleased."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An intellectual spendthrift," sighed Sir Horace "What a hopeless
      bankruptcy it leads to!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My notion is 'twould be spoiling him entirely to teach him a trade or a
      profession. Let his great faculties shoot up without being trimmed or
      trained; don't want to twist or twine or turn them at all, but just see
      whether he won't, out of his uncurbed nature, do better than all our
      discipline could effect. There's no better colt than the one that was
      never backed till he was a five-year-old."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He ought to have a career," said Sir Horace, thoughtfully. "Every man
      ought to have a calling, if only that he may be able to abandon it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as a sailor has a point of departure," said Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely," said Sir Horace, pleased at being so well appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are aware, Doctor," resumed he, after a pause, "that the lad will
      have little or no private fortune. There are family circumstances that I
      cannot enter into, nor would your own delicacy require it, that will leave
      him almost dependent on his own efforts. Now, as time is rolling over, we
      should bethink us what direction it were wisest to give his talents; for
      he has talents."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has genius and talents both," said Billy; "he has the raw material,
      and the workshop to manufacture it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am rejoiced to hear such an account from one so well able to
      pronounce," said Sir Horace, blandly; and Billy bowed, and blushed with a
      sense of happiness that none but humble men, so praised, could ever feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like much to hear what you would advise for him," said Upton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's so full of promise," said Billy, "that whatever he takes to he 'll
      be sure to fancy he 'd be better at something else. See, now,&mdash;it isn
      't a bull I 'm sayin', but I 'll make a blunder of it if I try to
      explain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on; I think I apprehend you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By coorse you do. Well, it's that same feelin' makes me cautious of
      sayin' what he ought to do. For, after all, a variety of capacity implies
      discursiveness, and discursiveness is the mother of failure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You speak like an oracle, Doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I do, it's because the priest is beside me," said Billy, howmg. "My
      notion is this: I'd let him cultivate his fine gifts for a year or two in
      any way he liked,&mdash;in work or idleness; for they 'll grow in the
      fallow as well as in the tilled land. I 'd let him be whatever he liked,&mdash;striving
      always, as he's sure to be striving, after something higher, and greater,
      and better than he'll ever reach; and then, when he has felt both his
      strength and his weakness, I 'd try and attach him to some great man in
      public life; set a grand ambition before him, and say, 'Go on.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's scarcely the stuff for public life," muttered Sir Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is," said Billy, boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He 'd be easily abashed,&mdash;easily deterred by failure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorra bit. Success might cloy, but failure would never damp him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't fancy him a speaker."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rouse him by a strong theme and a flat contradiction, and you 'll see
      what he can do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then his lounging, idle habits&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll do more in two hours than any one else in two days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a warm admirer, my dear Doctor," said Sir Horace, smiling
      blandly. "I should almost rather have such a friend than the qualities
      that win the friendship.&mdash;Have you a message for me, Antoine?" said
      he to a servant who stood at a little distance, waiting the order to
      approach. The man came forward, and whispered a few words. Sir Horace's
      cheek gave a faint, the very faintest possible, sign of flush as he
      listened, and uttering a brief "Very well," dismissed the messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you give me your arm, Doctor?" said he, languidly; and the elegant
      Sir Horace Upton passed down the crowded promenade, leaning on his uncouth
      companion, without the slightest consciousness of the surprise and sarcasm
      around him. No man more thoroughly could appreciate conventionalities; he
      would weigh the effect of appearances to the veriest nicety; but in
      practice he seemed either to forget his knowledge or despise it. So that,
      as leaning on the little dwarf's arm he moved along, his very air of
      fashionable languor seemed to heighten the absurdity of the contrast. Nay,
      he actually seemed to bestow an almost deferential attention to what the
      other said, bowing blandly his acquiescence, and smiling with an urbanity
      all his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the crowd that passed, nearly all knew the English Minister. Uncovered
      heads were bent obsequiously; graceful salutations met him as he went;
      while a hundred conjectures ran as to who and what might be his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a Mesmeric Professor, a Writer in Cipher, a Rabbi, an Egyptian
      Explorer, an Alchemist, an African Traveller, and, at last, Monsieur
      Thiers!&mdash;and so the fine world of Naples discussed the humble
      individual whom you and I, dear reader, are acquainted with as Billy
      Traynor.

      CHAPTER XXIV. HOW A "RECEPTION" COMES TO ITS CLOSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the evening of that day the handsome saloons of the great Hôtel
      "Universo" were filled with a brilliant assemblage to compliment the
      Princess Sabloukoff on her arrival. We have already introduced this lady
      to the reader, and have no need to explain the homage and attention of
      which she was the object. There is nothing which so perfectly illustrates
      the maxim of <i>ignotum pro magnifico</i> as the career of politics;
      certain individuals obtaining, as they do, a pre-eminence and authority
      from a species of mysterious prestige about them, and a reputation of
      having access at any moment to the highest personage in the world of state
      affairs. Doubtless great ministers are occasionally not sorry to see the
      public full cry on a false scent, and encourage to a certain extent this
      mystification; but still it would be an error to deny to such persons as
      we speak of a knowledge, if not actually an influence, in great affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Swedish Chancellor uttered his celebrated sarcasm on the
      governing capacities of Europe, the political <i>salon</i>, as a state
      engine, was not yet in existence. What additional energy might it have
      given to his remark, had he known that the tea-table was the chapel of
      ease to the council-room, and gossip a new power in the state. Despotic
      governments are always curious about public opinion; they dread while
      affecting to despise it. They, however, make a far greater mistake than
      this, for they imagine its true exponent to be the society of the highest
      in rank and station.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not necessary to insist upon an error so palpable, and yet it is one
      of which nearly every capital of Europe affords example; and the same
      council-chamber that would treat a popular movement with disdain would
      tremble at the epigram launched by some "elegant" of society. The theory
      is, "that the masses <i>act</i>, but never <i>think</i>; the higher ranks
      <i>think</i>, and set the rest in motion." Whether well or ill founded,
      one consequence of the system is to inundate the world with a number of
      persons who, no matter what their station or pretensions, are no other
      than spies. If it be observed that, generally speaking, there is nothing
      worth recording; that society, too much engaged with its own vicissitudes,
      troubles itself little with those of the state,&mdash;let it be remembered
      that the governments which employ these agencies are in a position to
      judge of the value of what they receive; and as they persevere in
      maintaining them, they are, doubtless, in some degree, remunerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      To hold this high detective employ, a variety of conditions are essential.
      The individual must have birth and breeding to gain access to the highest
      circles; conciliating manners and ample means. If a lady, she is usually
      young and a beauty, or has the fame of having once been such. The
      strangest part of all is, that her position is thoroughly appreciated. She
      is recognized everywhere for what she is; and yet her presence never seems
      to impose a restraint or suggest a caution. She becomes, in reality, less
      a discoverer than a depositary of secrets. Many have something to
      communicate, and are only at a loss as to the channel. They have found out
      a political puzzle, hit a state blot, or unravelled a cabinet mystery.
      Others are in possession of some personal knowledge of royalty. They have
      marked the displeasure of the Queen Dowager, or seen the anger of the
      Crown Prince. Profitable as such facts are, they are nothing without a
      market. Thus it is that these characters exercise a wider sphere of
      influence than might be naturally ascribed to them, and possess besides a
      terrorizing power over society, the chief members of which are at their
      mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, doubtless, not a little humiliating that such should be the
      instruments of a government, and that royalty should avail itself of such
      agencies; but the fact is so, and perhaps an inquiry into the secret
      working of democratic institutions might not make one a whit more proud of
      Popular Sovereignty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the proficients in the great science we speak of, the Princess
      held the first place. Mysterious stories ran of her acquaintance with
      affairs the most momentous; there were narratives of her complicity in
      even darker events. Her name was quoted by Savary in his secret report of
      the Emperor Paul's death; an allusion to her was made by one of the
      assassins of Murat; and a gloomy record of a celebrated incident in Louis
      Philippe's life ascribed to her a share in a terrible tragedy. Whether
      believed or not, they added to the prestige that attended her, and she was
      virtually a "puissance" in European politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      To all the intriguists in state affairs her arrival was actually a boon.
      She could and would give them, out of her vast capital, enough to
      establish them successfully in trade. To the minister of police she
      brought accurate descriptions of suspected characters,&mdash;the <i>signalements</i>
      of Carbonari that were threatening half the thrones of Europe. To the
      foreign secretary she brought tidings of the favor in which a great
      Emperor held him, and a shadowy vision of the grand cross he was one day
      to have. She had forbidden books for the cardinal confessor, and a case of
      smuggled cigars for the minister of finance. The picturesque language of a
      "Journal de Modes" could alone convey the rare and curious details of
      dress which she imported for the benefit of the court ladies. In a word,
      she had something to secure her a welcome in every quarter,&mdash;and all
      done with a tact and a delicacy that the most susceptible could not have
      resisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the tone and manner of good society present little suitable to
      description, they are yet subjects of great interest to him who would
      study men in their moods of highest subtlety and astuteness. To mere
      passing careless observation, the reception of the Princess was a crowded
      gathering of a number of well-dressed people, in which the men were in far
      larger proportion than the other sex. There was abundance of courtesy; not
      a little of that half-flattering compliment which is the small change of
      intercourse; some&mdash;not much&mdash;scandal, and a fair share of
      small-talk. It was late when Sir Horace Upton entered, and, advancing to
      where the Princess stood, kissed her gloved hand with all the submissive
      deference of a courtier. The most lynx-eyed observer could not have
      detected either in his manner or in hers that any intimacy existed between
      them, much less friendship; least of all, anything still closer. His
      bearing was a most studied and respectful homage,&mdash;hers a haughty,
      but condescending, acceptance of it; and yet, with all this, there was
      that in those around that seemed to say, "This man is more master here
      than any of us." He did not speak long with the Princess, but,
      respectfully yielding his place to a later arrival, fell back into the
      crowd, and soon after took a seat beside one of the very few ladies who
      graced the reception. In all, they were very few, we are bound to
      acknowledge; for although La Sabloukoff was received at court and all the
      embassies, they who felt, or affected to feel, any strictness on the score
      of morals avoided rather than sought her intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She covered over what might have seemed this disparagement of her conduct,
      by always seeking the society of men, as though their hardy and vigorous
      intellects were more in unison with her own than the graceful attributes
      of the softer sex; and in this tone did the few lady friends she possessed
      appear also to concur. It was their pride to discuss matters of state and
      politics; and whenever they condescended to more trifling themes, they
      treated them with a degree of candor and in a spirit that allowed men to
      speak as unreservedly as though no ladies were present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us be forgiven for prolixity, since we are speaking less of
      individuals than of a school,&mdash;a school, too, on the increase, and
      one whose results will be more widely felt than many are disposed to
      believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the evening wore on, the guests bartered the news and <i>bons mots</i>;
      scraps of letters from royal hands were read; epigrams from illustrious
      characters repeated; racy bits of courtly scandal were related; and shrewd
      explanations hazarded as to how this was to turn out, and that was to end.
      It was a very strange language they talked,&mdash;so much seemed left for
      inference, so much seemed left to surmise. There was a shadowy
      indistinctness, as it were, over all; and yet their manner showed a
      perfect and thorough appreciation of whatever went forward. Through all
      this treatment of great questions, one striking feature pre-eminently
      displayed itself,&mdash;a keen appreciation of how much the individual
      characters, the passions, the prejudices, the very caprices of men in
      power modified the acts of their governments; and thus you constantly
      heard such remarks as, "If the Duke of Wellington disliked the Emperor
      less; or, so long as Metternich has such an attachment to the Queen
      Dowager; when we get over Carini's dread of the Archduchess; or, if we
      could only reconcile the Prince to a visit from Nesselrode,"&mdash;showing
      that private personal feelings were swaying the minds of those whose
      contemplation might have seemed raised to a far loftier level. And then
      what a mass of very small gossip abounded,&mdash;incidents so slight and
      insignificant that they only were lifted into importance by the actors in
      them being Kings and Kaisers! By what accidents great events were
      determined; on what mere trifles vast interests depended,&mdash;it were,
      doubtless, no novelty to record; still, it would startle many to be told
      that a casual pique, a passing word launched at hazard, some petty
      observance omitted or forgotten, have changed the destinies of whole
      nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in such circles as these that incidents of this kind are recounted.
      Each has some anecdote, trivial and unimportant it may be, but still
      illustrating the life of those who live under the shadow of Royalty. The
      Princess herself was inexhaustible in these stores of secret biography;
      there was not a dynastic ambition to be consolidated by a marriage, not a
      Coburg alliance to patch up a family compact, that she was not well versed
      in. She detected in the vaguest movements plans and intentions, and could
      read the signs of a policy in indications that others would have passed
      without remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one the company retired, and at length Sir Horace found himself the
      last guest of the evening. Scarcely had the door closed on the last
      departure, when, drawing his arm-chair to the side of the fire opposite to
      that where the Princess sat, he took out his cigar-case, and, selecting a
      cheroot, deliberately lighted and commenced to smoke it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought they 'd never go," said she, with a sigh; "but I know why they
      remained,&mdash;they all thought the Prince of Istria was coming. They saw
      his carriage stop here this evening, and heard he had sent up to know if I
      received. I wrote on a card, 'To-morrow at dinner, at eight;' so be sure
      you are here to meet him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Horace bowed, and smiled his acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your journey, dear Princess," said he, between the puffs of his
      smoke, "was it pleasant?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might have been well enough, but I was obliged to make a great <i>détour</i>.
      The Duchess detained me at Parma for some letters, and then sent me across
      the mountains of Pontremoli&mdash;a frightful road&mdash;on a secret
      mission to Massa."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Massa! of all earthly places."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even so. They had sent down there, some eight or nine months ago, the
      young Count Wahnsdorf, the Archduchess Sophia's son, who, having got into
      all manner of dissipation at Vienna, and lost largely at play, it was
      judged expedient to exile him for a season; and as the Duke of Modena
      offered his aid to their plans, he was named to a troop in a dragoon
      regiment, and appointed aide-de-camp to his Royal Highness. Are you
      attending; or has your Excellency lost the clew of my story?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am all ears; only waiting anxiously to hear: who is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, then, you suspect a woman in the case?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure of it, dear Princess. The very accents of your voice prepared
      me for a bit of romance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you are right; he has fallen in love,&mdash;so desperately in love
      that he is incessant in his appeals to the Duchess to intercede with his
      family and grant him leave to marry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To marry whom?" asked Sir Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the very question which he cannot answer himself; and when pressed
      for information, can only reply that 'she is an angel.' Now, angels are
      not always of good family; they have sometimes very humble parents, and
      very small fortunes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Hélas!</i>" sighed the diplomatist, pitifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This angel, it would seem, is untraceable. She arrived with her mother,
      or what is supposed to be her mother, from Corsica; they landed at
      Spezzia, with an English passport, calling them Madame and Mademoiselle
      Harley. On arriving at Massa they took a villa close to the town, and
      established themselves with all the circumstance of people well-off as to
      means. They, however, neither received visits nor made acquaintance with
      any one. They even so far withdrew themselves from public view that they
      rarely left their own grounds, and usually took their carriage-airing at
      night. You are not attending, I see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, I am an eager listener; only, it is a story one has
      heard so often. I never heard of any one preserving the incognito except
      where disclosure would have revealed a shame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Excellency mistakes," replied she; "the incognito is sometimes, like
      a feigned despatch in diplomacy, a means of awakening curiosity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Ces ruses ne se font plus</i>, Princess,&mdash;they were the fashion
      in Talleyrand's time; now we are satisfied to mystify by no meaning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the weapons of the old school are not employed, there is another
      reason, perhaps," said she, with a dubious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That modern arms are too feeble to wield them, you mean," said he, bowing
      courteously. "Ah! it is but too true, Princess;" and he sighed what might
      mean regret over the fact, or devotion to herself,&mdash;perhaps both. At
      all events, his submission served as a treaty of peace, and she resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, <i>revenons à nos moutons</i>," said she, "or at least to our
      lambs. This Wahnsdorf is quite capable of contracting a marriage without
      any permission, if they appear inclined to thwart him; and the question
      is, What can be done? The Duke would send these people away out of his
      territory, only that, if they be English, as their passports imply, he
      knows that there will be no end of trouble with your amiable Government,
      which is never paternal till some one corrects one of her children. If
      Wahnsdorf be sent away, where are they to send him? Besides, in all these
      cases the creature carries his malady with him, and is sure to marry the
      first who sympathizes with him. In a word, there were difficulties on all
      sides, and the Duchess sent me over, in observation, as they say, rather
      than with any direct plan of extrication."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you went?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I passed twenty-four hours. I couldn't stay longer, for I promised
      the Cardinal Caraffa to be in Rome on the 18th, about those Polish
      nunneries. As to Massa, I gathered little more than I had heard
      beforehand. I saw their villa; I even penetrated as far as the orangery in
      my capacity of traveller,&mdash;the whole a perfect Paradise. I 'm not
      sure I did not get a peep at Eve herself,&mdash;at a distance, however. I
      made great efforts to obtain an interview, but all unsuccessfully. The
      police authorities managed to summon two of the servants to the Podestà,
      on pretence of some irregularity in their papers, but we obtained nothing
      out of them; and, what is more, I saw clearly that nothing could be
      effected by a <i>coup de main</i>. The place requires a long siege, and I
      had not time for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you see Wahnsdorf?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I had him to dinner with me alone at the hotel, for, to avoid all
      observation, I only went to the Palace after nightfall. He confessed all
      his sins to me, and, like every other scapegrace, thought marriage was a
      grand absolution for past wickedness. He told me, too, how he made the
      acquaintance of these strangers. They were crossing the Magra with their
      carriage on a raft, when the cable snapped, and they were all carried down
      the torrent. He happened to be a passenger at the time, and did something
      very heroic, I 've no doubt, but I cannot exactly remember what; but it
      amounted to either being, or being supposed to be, their deliverer. He
      thus obtained leave to pay his respects at the villa. But even this
      gratitude was very measured; they only admitted him at rare intervals, and
      for a very brief visit. In fact, it was plain he had to deal with
      consummate tacticians, who turned the mystery of their seclusion and the
      honor vouchsafed him to an ample profit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He told them his name and his rank?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; and he owned that they did not seem at all impressed by the
      revelation. He describes them as very naughty, very condescending in
      manner, <i>très grandes dames</i>, in fact, but unquestionably born to the
      class they represent. They never dropped a hint of whence they had come,
      or any circumstance of their past lives, but seemed entirely engrossed by
      the present, which they spent principally in cultivating the arts; they
      both drew admirably, and the young lady had become a most skilful
      modellist in clay, her whole day being passed in a studio which they had
      just built. I urged him strongly to try and obtain permission for me to
      see it, but he assured me it was hopeless,&mdash;the request might even
      endanger his own position with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could perceive that, though very much in love, Wahns-dorf was equally
      taken with the romance of this adventure. He had never been a hero to
      himself before, and he was perfectly enchanted by the novelty of the
      sensation. He never affected to say that he had made the least impression
      on the young lady's heart; but he gave me to understand that the nephew of
      an Emperor need not trouble his head much on that score. He is a very
      good-looking, well-mannered, weak boy, who, if he only reach the age of
      thirty without some great blunder, will pass for a very dignified Prince
      for the rest of his life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you give him any hopes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, if he only promised to follow my counsels; and as these same
      counsels are yet in the oven, he must needs wait for them. In a word, he
      is to write to me everything, and I to him; and so we parted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to see these people," said Upton, languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure of it," rejoined she; "but it is perhaps unnecessary;" and there
      was that in the tone which made the words very significant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chelmsford&mdash;he 's now Secretary at Turin&mdash;might perhaps trace
      them," said he; "he always knows everything of those people who are
      secrets to the rest of the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the present, I am disposed to think it were better not to direct
      attention towards them," replied she. "What we do here must be done
      adroitly, and in such a way as that it can be disavowed if necessary, or
      abandoned if unsuccessful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Said with all your own tact, Princess," said Sir Horace, smiling. "I can
      perceive, however, that you have a plan in your head already. Is it not
      so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said she, with a faint sigh; "I took wonderfully little interest in
      the affair. It was one of those games where the combinations are so few
      you don't condescend to learn it. Are you aware of the hour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Actually three o'clock," said he, standing up. "Really, Princess, I am
      quite shocked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so am I," said she, smiling; "<i>on se compromet si facilement dans
      ce bas monde</i>. Good night." And she courtesied and withdrew before he
      had time to take his hat and retire.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. A DUKE AND HIS MINISTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      In this age of the world, when everybody has been everywhere, seen
      everything, and talked with everybody, it may savor of an impertinence if
      we ask of our reader if he has ever been at Massa. It may so chance that
      he has not, and, if so, as assuredly has he yet an untasted pleasure
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, to be sure, Massa is not as it once was. The little Duchy, whose
      capital it formed, has been united to a larger state. The distinctive
      features of a metropolis, and the residence of a sovereign prince, are
      gone. The life and stir and animation which surround a court have
      subsided; grass-grown streets and deserted squares replace the busy
      movement of former days; a dreamy weariness seems to have fallen over
      every one, as though life offered no more prizes for exertion, and that
      the day of ambition was set forever. Yet are there features about the spot
      which all the chances and changes of political fortune cannot touch.
      Dynasties may fall, and thrones crumble, but the eternal Apennines will
      still rear their snow-clad summits towards the sky. Along the vast plain
      of ancient olives the perfumed wind will still steal at evening, and the
      blue waters of the Mediterranean plash lazily among the rocks, over which
      the myrtle and the arbutus are hanging. There, amidst them all, half hid
      in clustering vines, bathed in soft odors from orange-groves, with
      plashing fountains glittering in the sun, and foaming streams gushing from
      the sides of marble mountains,&mdash;there stands Massa, ruined, decayed,
      and deserted, but beautiful in all its desolation, and fairer to gaze on
      than many a scene where the tide of human fortune is at the flood.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you wander there now, passing the deep arch over which, hundreds of
      feet above you, the ancient fortress frowns, and enter the silent streets,
      you would find it somewhat difficult to believe how, a very few years
      back, this was the brilliant residence of a court,&mdash;the gay resort of
      strangers from every land of Europe,&mdash;that showy equipages traversed
      these weed-grown squares, and highborn dames swept proudly beneath these
      leafy alleys. Hard, indeed, to fancy the glittering throng of courtiers,
      the merry laughter of light-hearted beauty, beneath these trellised
      shades, where, moodily and slow, some solitary figure now steals along,
      "pondering sad thoughts over the bygone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But a few, a very few years ago, and Massa was in the plenitude of its
      prosperity. The revenues of the state were large,&mdash;more than
      sufficient to have maintained all that such a city could require, and
      nearly enough to gratify every caprice of a prince whose costly tastes
      ranged over every theme, and found in each a pretext for reckless
      expenditure. He was one of those men whom Nature, having gifted largely,
      "takes out" the compensation by a disposition of instability and
      fickleness that renders every acquirement valueless. He could have been
      anything,&mdash;orator, poet, artist, soldier, statesman; and yet, in the
      very diversity of his abilities there was that want of fixity of purpose
      that left him ever short of success, till he himself, wearied by repeated
      failures, distrusted his own powers, and ceased to exert them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a man, under the hard pressure of a necessity, might have done great
      things; as it was, born to a princely station, and with a vast fortune, he
      became a reckless spendthrift,&mdash;a dreamy visionary at one time, an
      enthusiastic dilettante at another. There was not a scheme of government
      he had not eagerly embraced and abandoned in turn. He had attracted to his
      little capital all that Europe could boast of artistic excellence, and as
      suddenly he had thrown himself into the most intolerant zeal of Papal
      persecution,&mdash;denouncing every species of pleasure, and ordaining a
      more than monastic self-denial and strictness. There was only one mode of
      calculating what he might be, which was, by imagining the very opposite to
      what he then was. Extremes were his delight, and he undulated between
      Austrian tyranny and democratic licentiousness in politics, just as he
      vacillated between the darkest bigotry of his church and open infidelity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time when we desire to present him to our readers (the exact year
      is not material), he was fast beginning to weary of an interregnum of
      asceticism and severity. He had closed theatres, and suppressed all public
      rejoicings; and for an entire winter he had sentenced his faithful
      subjects to the unbroken sway of the Priest and the Friar,&mdash;a species
      of rule which had banished all strangers from the Duchy, and threatened,
      by the injury to trade, the direst consequences to his capital. To have
      brought the question formally before him in all its details would have
      ensured the downfall of any minister rash enough for such daring. There
      was, indeed, but one man about the court who had courage for the
      enterprise; and to him we would devote a few lines as we pass. He was an
      Englishman, named Stubber. He had originally come out to Italy with horses
      for his Highness, and been induced, by good offers of employment, to
      remain. He was not exactly stable-groom, nor trainer, nor was he of the
      dignity of master of the stables; but he was something whose attributes
      included a little of all, and something more. One thing he assuredly was,&mdash;a
      consummately clever fellow, who could apply all his native Yorkshire
      shrewdness to a new sphere, and make of his homespun faculties the keen
      intelligence by which he could guide himself in novel and difficult
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain freedom of speech, with a bold hardihood of character, based, it
      is true, upon a conscious sense of honor, had brought him more than once
      under the notice of the Prince. His Highness felt such pleasure in the
      outspoken frankness of the man that he frequently took opportunities of
      conversing with him, and even asking his advice. Never deterred by the
      subject, whatever it was, Stubber spoke out his mind; and by the very
      force of strong native sense, and an unswerving power of determination,
      soon impressed his master that his best counsels were to be had from the
      Yorkshire jockey, and not from the decorated and gilded throng who filled
      the antechambers.
    </p>
    <p>
      To elevate the groom to the rank of personal attendant, to create him a
      Chevalier, and then a Count, were all easy steps to such a Prince. At the
      time we speak of, Stubber was chief of the Cabinet,&mdash;the trusted
      adviser of his master in knottiest questions of foreign politics, the
      arbiter of the most difficult points with other states, the highest
      authority in home affairs, and the absolute ruler over the Duke's
      household and all who belonged to it. He was one of those men of action
      who speedily distinguish themselves wherever the game of life is being
      played. Smart to discern the character of those around him, prompt to
      avail himself of their knowledge, little hampered by the scruples which
      conventionalities impose on men bred in a higher station, he generally
      attained his object before others had arranged their plans to oppose him.
      To these qualities he added a rugged, unflinching honesty, and a loyal
      attachment to the person of his Prince. Strong in his own conscious
      rectitude, and in the confiding regard of his sovereign, Stubber stood
      alone against all the wiles and machinations of his formidable rivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were we giving a history of this curious court and its intrigues, we could
      relate some strange stories of the mechanism by which states are ruled. We
      have, however, no other business with the subject than as it enters into
      the domain of our own story, and to this we return.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a calm evening of the early autumn, as the Prince, accompanied by
      Stubber alone, and unattended by even a groom, rode along one of the
      alleys of the olive wood which skirts the sea-shore beneath Massa. His
      Highness was unusually moody and thoughtful, and as he sauntered
      carelessly along, seemed scarcely to notice the objects about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What month are we in, Stubber?" asked he, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      "September, Altezza," was the short reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Per Bacco!</i> so it is; and in this very month we were to have been
      in Bohemia with the Archduke Stephen,&mdash;the best shooting in all
      Europe, and the largest stock of pheasants in the whole world, perhaps;
      and I, that love field-sports as no man ever loved them! Eh, Stubber?" and
      he turned abruptly round to seek a confirmation of what he asserted.
      Either Stubber did not fully agree in the judgment, or did not deem it
      necessary to record his concurrence; but the Prince was obliged to
      reiterate his statement, adding, "I might say, indeed, it is the one
      solitary dissipation I have ever permitted myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, this was a stereotyped phrase of his Highness, and employed by him
      respecting music, literature, field-sports, picture-buying, equipage,
      play, and a number of other pursuits not quite so pardonable, in each of
      which, for the time, his zeal would seem to be exclusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      A scarcely audible ejaculation&mdash;a something like a grunt&mdash;from
      Stubber, was the only assent to this proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And here I am," added the Prince, testily, "the only man of my rank in
      Europe, perhaps, without society, amusement, or pleasure, condemned to the
      wearisome details of a petty administration, and actually a slave,&mdash;yes,
      sir, I say, a slave&mdash;What the deuce is this? My horse is sinking
      above his pasterns. Where are we, Stubber?" and with a vigorous dash of
      the spurs he extricated himself from the deep ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I often told your Highness that these lands were ruined for want of
      drainage. You may remark how poor the trees are along here; the fruit,
      too, is all deteriorated,&mdash;all for want of a little skill and
      industry. And, if your Highness remarked the appearance of the people in
      that village, every second man has the ague on him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They did look very wretched. And why is it not drained? Why isn't
      everything done as it ought, Stubber, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why is n't your Highness in Bohemia?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Want of means, my good Stubber; no money. My man, Landelli, tells me the
      coffer is empty; and until this new tax on the Colza comes in, we shall
      have to live on our credit or our wits,&mdash;I forget which, but I
      conclude they are about equally productive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Landelli is a <i>ladro</i>," said Stubber. "He has money enough to build
      a new wing to his château in Serravezza, and to give fifty thousand scudi
      of fortune to his daughter, though he can't afford your Highness the
      common necessaries of your station."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Per Bacco!</i> Billy, you are right; you must look into these accounts
      yourself. They always confuse me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>have</i> looked into them, and your Highness shall have two hundred
      thousand francs to-morrow on your dressing-table, and as much more within
      the week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well done, Billy! you are the only fellow who can unmask these rogueries.
      If I had only had you with me long ago! Well! well! well! it is too late
      to think of it. What shall we do with this money? Bohemia is out of the
      question now. Shall we rebuild the San Felice? It is really too small; the
      stage is crowded with twenty people on it. There's that gate towards
      Carrara, when is it to be completed? There's a figure wanted for the
      centre pedestal. As for the fountain, it must be done by the municipality.
      It is essentially the interest of the townspeople. You 'd advise me to
      spend the money in draining these low lands, or in a grant to that new
      company for a pier at Marina; but I 'll not; I have other thoughts in my
      head. Why should not this be the centre of art to the whole Peninsula?
      Carrara is a city of sculptors. Why not concentrate their efforts here&mdash;by
      a gallery? I have myself some glorious things,&mdash;the best group Canova
      ever modelled; the original Ariadne too,&mdash;far finer than the thing
      people go to see at Frankfort. Then there's Tanderini's Shepherd with the
      Goats.&mdash;Who lives yonder, Stubber? What a beautiful garden it is!"
      And he drew up short in front of a villa whose grounds were terraced in a
      succession of gardens down to the very margin of the sea. Plants and
      shrubs of other climates were mingled with those familiar to Italy, making
      up a picture of singular beauty, by diversity of color and foliage. "Isn't
      this the 'Ombretta,' Stubber?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Altezza; but the Morelli have left it. It is let now to a stranger,&mdash;a
      French lady. Some call her English, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure; I remember. There was a demand about a formal permission to
      reside here. Landelli advised me not to sign it,&mdash;that she might turn
      out English, or have some claim upon England, which was quite equivalent
      to placing the Duchy, and all within it, under that blessed thing they
      call British protection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are worse things than even that," muttered Stubber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "British occupation, perhaps you mean; well, you may be right. At all
      events, I did not take Landelli's advice, for I gave the permission, and I
      have never heard more of her. She must be rich, I take it. See what order
      this place is kept in; that conservatory is very large indeed, and the
      orange-trees are finer than ours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They seem very fine indeed," said Stubber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, sir, that we have none such at the Palace. I'll wager a zecchino
      they have come from Naples. And look at that magnolia: I tell you,
      Stubber, this garden is very far superior to ours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Highness has not been in the Palace gardens lately, perhaps. I was
      there this morning, and they are really in admirable order."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll have a peep inside of these grounds, Stubber," said the Duke, who,
      no longer attentive to the other, only followed out his own train of
      thought. At the same instant he dismounted, and, without giving himself
      any trouble about his horse, made straight for a small wicket which lay
      invitingly open in front of him. The narrow skirting of copse passed, the
      Duke at once found himself in the midst of a lovely garden, laid out with
      consummate skill and taste, and offering at intervals the most beautiful
      views of the surrounding scenery. Although much of what he beheld around
      him was the work of many years, there were abundant traces of innovation
      and improvement. Some of the statues were recently placed, and a small
      temple of Grecian architecture seemed to have been just restored. A heavy
      curtain hung across the doorway; drawing back which, the Duke entered what
      he at once perceived to be a sculptor's studio. Casts and models lay
      carelessly about, and a newly begun group stood enshrouded in the wetted
      drapery with which artists clothe their unfinished labors. No mean artist
      himself, the Duke examined critically the figures before him; nor was he
      long in perceiving that the artist had committed more than one fault in
      drawing and proportion. "This is amateur work," said he to himself; "and
      yet not without cleverness, and a touch of genius too. Your dilettante
      scorns anatomy, and will not submit to drudgery; hence, here are muscles
      incorrectly developed, and their action ill expressed." So saying, he sat
      down before the model, and taking up one of the tools at his side, began
      to correct some of the errors in the work. It was exactly the kind of task
      for which his skill adapted him. Too impatient and too discursive to
      accomplish anything of his own, he was admirably fitted to correct the
      faults of another, and so he worked away vigorously,&mdash;totally
      forgetting where he was, how he had come there, and as utterly oblivious
      of Stubber, whom he had left without. Growing more and more interested as
      he proceeded, he arose at length to take a better view of what he had
      done, and, standing some distance off, exclaimed aloud, "<i>Per Bacco!</i>
      I have made a good thing of it&mdash;there 's life in it now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So indeed is there," cried a gentle voice behind him; and, turning, he
      beheld a young and very beautiful girl, whose dress was covered by the
      loose blouse of a sculptor. "How I thank you for this!" said she, blushing
      deeply, as she courtesied before him. "I have had no teaching, and never
      till this moment knew how much I needed it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this is your work, then?" said the Duke, who turned again towards the
      model. "Well, there is promise in it. There is even more. Still, you have
      hard labor before you, if you would be really an artist. There is a
      grammar in these things, and he who would speak the tongue must get over
      the declensions. I know but little myself&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, do not say so!" cried she, eagerly; "I feel that I am in a master's
      presence."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke started, partly struck by the energy of her manner, in part by
      the words themselves. It is often difficult for men in his station to
      believe that they are not known and recognized; and so he stood wondering
      at her, and thinking who she could be that did not know him to be the
      Prince. "You mistake me," said he, gently, and with that dignity which is
      the birthright of those born to command. "I am but a very indifferent
      artist. I have studied a little, it is true; but other pursuits and
      idleness have swept away the small knowledge I once possessed, and left
      me, as to art, pretty much as I am in morals,&mdash;that is, I know what
      is right, but very often I can't accomplish it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are from Carrara, I conclude?" said the young girl, timidly, still
      curious to hear more about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me," said he, smiling; "I am a native of Massa, and live here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And are you not a sculptor by profession?" asked she, still more eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said he, laughing pleasantly; "I follow a more precarious trade, nor
      can I mould the clay I work in so deftly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At least you love art," said she, with an enthusiasm heightened by the
      changes he had effected in her group.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now it is my turn to question, Signorina," said he, gayly. "Why, with a
      talent like yours, have you not given yourself to regular study? You live
      in a land where instruction should not be difficult to obtain. Carrara is
      one vast studio; there must be many there who would not alone be willing,
      but even proud, to have such a pupil. Have you never thought of this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have thought of it," said she, pensively, "but my aunt, with whom I
      live, desires to see no one, to know no one;&mdash;even now," added she,
      blushing deeply, "I find myself conversing with an utter stranger, in a
      way&mdash;" She stopped, overwhelmed with confusion, and he finished her
      sentence for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a way which shows how naturally a love of art establishes a confidence
      between those who profess it." As he spoke, the curtain was drawn back,
      and a lady entered, who, though several years older, bore such a likeness
      to the young girl that she might readily have been taken for her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is at length time I should make my excuses for this intrusion,
      madame," said he, turning towards her; and then in a few words explained
      how the accidental passing by the spot, and the temptation of the open
      wicket, had led him to a trespass, "which," added he, smiling, "I can only
      say I shall be charmed if you will condescend to retaliate. I, too, have
      some objects of art, and gardens which are thought worthy of a visit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We live here, sir, apart from the world. It is for that reason we have
      selected this residence," replied she, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall respect your seclusion, madame," answered he, with a deep bow,
      "and only beg once more to tender my sincere apologies for the past." He
      moved towards the door as he spoke, the ladies courtesied deeply, and,
      with a still lowlier reverence, he passed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke lingered in the garden, as though unwilling to leave the spot.
      For a while some doubt as to whether he had been recognized passed through
      his mind, but he soon satisfied himself that such was not the case, and
      the singularity of the situation amused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am culling a souvenir, madame," said he, plucking a moss-ross as the
      lady passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will give you a better one, sir," said she, detaching one from her
      bouquet, and handing it to him. And so they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Per Bacco!</i> Stubber, I have seen two very charming women. They are
      evidently persons of condition; find out all about them, and let me hear
      it to-morrow." And so say-ing, his Highness rode away, thinking pleasantly
      over his adventure, and fancying a hundred ways in which it might be
      amusingly carried out. The life of princes is rarely fertile in surprises;
      perhaps, therefore, the uncommon and unusual are the pleasantest of all
      their sensations.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. ITALIAN TROUBLES
    </h2>
    <p>
      Stubber knew his master well. There was no need for any "perquisitions" on
      his part; the ladies, the studio, and the garden were totally forgotten
      ere nightfall. Some rather alarming intelligence had arrived from Carrara,
      which had quite obliterated every memory of his late adventure. That
      little town of artists had long been the resort of an excited class of
      politicians, and it was more than rumored that the "Carbonari" had
      established there a lodge of their order. Inflammatory placards had been
      posted through the town&mdash;violent denunciations of the Government&mdash;vengeance,
      even on the head of the sovereign, openly proclaimed, and a speedy day
      promised when the wrongs of an enslaved people should be avenged in blood.
      The messenger who brought the alarming tidings to Massa carried with him
      many of the inflammatory documents, as well as several knives and
      poniards, discovered by the activity of the police in a ruined building at
      the sea-shore. No arrests had as yet been made, but the authorities were
      in possession of information with regard to various suspicious characters,
      and the police prepared to act at a moment's notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an hour after midnight when the Council met; and the Duke sat,
      pale, agitated, and terrified, at the table, with Landelli, the Prime
      Minister, Caprini, the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and General
      Ferrucio, the War Minister; a venerable ecclesiastic, Monsignore Abbati,
      occupying the lowest place, in virtue of his humble station as confessor
      of his Highness. He who of all others enjoyed his master's confidence, and
      whose ready intelligence was most needed in the emergency, was not
      present; his title of Minister of the Household not qualifying him for a
      place at the Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the result, the deliberation was a long one. Even while it
      continued, there was time to despatch a courier to Carrara, and receive
      the answer he brought back; and when the Duke returned to his room, it was
      already far advanced in the morning. Fatigued and harassed, he dismissed
      his valet at once, and desired that Stubber might attend him. When he
      arrived, however, his Highness had fallen off asleep, and lay, dressed as
      he was, on his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stubber sat noiselessly beside his master, his mind deeply pondering over
      the events which, although he had not been present at the Council, had all
      been related to him. It was not the first time he had heard of that
      formidable conspiracy, which, under the title of the Carbonari, had
      established themselves in every corner of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days of his humbler fortune he had known several of them
      intimately; he had been often solicited to join their band; but while
      steadily refusing this, he had detected much which to his keen
      intelligence savored of treachery to the cause amongst them. This cause
      was necessarily recruited from those whose lives rejected all honest and
      patient labor. They were the disappointed men of every station, from the
      highest to the lowest. The ruined gentleman, the beggared noble, the
      bankrupt trader, the houseless artisan, the homeless vagabond, were all
      there; bold, daring, and energetic, fearless as to the present, reckless
      as to the future. They sought for any change, no matter what, seeing that
      in the convulsion their own condition must be bettered. Few troubled their
      heads how these changes were to be accomplished; they cared little for the
      real grievances they assumed to redress: their work was demolition. It was
      to the hour of pillage alone they looked for the recompense of their
      hardihood. Some, unquestionably, took a different view of the agencies and
      the objects; dreamy, speculative men, with high aspirations, hoped that
      the cruel wrongs which tyranny inflicted on many a European state might be
      effectually curbed by a glorious freedom, when each man's actions should
      be made comformable to the benefit of the community, and the will of all
      be typified in the conduct of each. There was, however, another class, and
      to these Stubber had given deep attention. It was a party whose singular
      activity and energy were always in the ascendant,&mdash;ever suggesting
      bold measures whose results could scarcely be more than menaces, and
      advocating actions whose greatest effect could not rise above acts of
      terror and dismay. And thus while the leaders plotted great political
      convulsions, and the masses dreamed of sack and pillage, these latter
      dealt in acts of assassination,&mdash;the vengeance of the poniard and the
      poison-cup. These were the men Stubber had studied with no common
      attention. He fancied he saw in them neither the dupes of their own
      excited imaginations, nor the reckless followers of rapine, but an order
      of men equal to the former by intelligence, but far transcending the last
      in crime and infamy. In his own early experiences he had perceived that
      more than one of these had expatriated themselves suddenly, carrying away
      to foreign shores considerable wealth, and, that, too, under circumstances
      where the acquisition of property seemed scarcely possible. Others he had
      seen as suddenly, throwing off their political associates, rise into
      stations of rank and power; and one memorable case he knew where the
      individual had become the chief adviser of the very state whose
      destruction he had sworn to accomplish. Such a one he now fancied he had
      detected among the advisers of his Prince; and deeply ruminating on this
      theme, he sat at the bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it a dream, Stubber, or have we really heard bad news from Carrara?
      Has Fraschetti been stabbed, or not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, your Highness, he has been stabbed exactly two inches below where he
      was wounded in September last,&mdash;then, it was his pocket-book saved
      him; now, it was your Highness's picture, which, like a faithful follower,
      he always carried about him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which means, that you disbelieve the whole story."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every word of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the poniards found at the Bocca di Magra?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Found by those who placed them there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the proclamations?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blundering devices. See, here is one of them, printed on the very paper
      supplied to the Government offices. There 's he water-mark, with the crown
      and your own cipher on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Per Bacco!</i>so it is. Let me show this to Landelli."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait awhile, your Highness; let us trace this a little farther. No
      arrests have been made?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor will any. The object in view is already gained; they have terrified
      you, and secured the next move."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simply, that they have persuaded you that this state is the hotbed of
      revolutionists; that your own means of security and repression are unequal
      to the emergency; that disaffection exists in the army; and that, whether
      for the maintenance of the Government or your safety, you have only one
      course remaining."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which is&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To call in the Austrians."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Per Bacco!</i> it is exactly what they have advised. How did you come
      to know it? Who is the traitor at the Council-board?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I could tell you the name of one who was not such. Why, your
      Highness, these fellows are not <i>your</i> Ministers, except in so far as
      they are paid by you. They are Metternich's people; they receive their
      appointments from Vienna, and are only accountable to the cabinet held at
      Schönbrunn. If wise and moderate counsels prevailed here, if our financial
      measures prospered, if the people were happy and contented, how long,
      think you, would Lombardy submit to be ruled by the rod and the bayonet?
      Do you imagine that <i>you</i> will be suffered to give an example to the
      Peninsula of a good administration?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But so it is," broke in the Prince; "I defy any man to assert the
      opposite. The country <i>is</i> prosperous, the people <i>are</i>
      contented, the laws justly administered, and, I hesitate not to say,
      myself as popular as any sovereign of Europe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I tell your Highness, just as distinctly, that the country is ground
      down with taxation, even to export duties on the few things we have to
      export; that the people are poor to the very verge of starvation; that if
      they do not take to the highways as brigands, it is because some
      traditions as honest men yet survive amongst them; that the laws only
      exist as an agent of tyranny, arrest and imprisonment being at the mere
      caprice of the authorities. Nor is there a means by which an innocent man
      can demand his trial, and insist on being confronted with his accuser.
      Your jails are full, crowded to a state of pestilence with supposed
      political offenders, men that, in a free country, would be at large,
      toiling industriously for their families, and whose opinions could never
      be dangerous, if not festering in the foul air of a dungeon. And as to <i>your
      own</i> popularity, all I say is, don't walk in the Piazza at Carrara
      after dusk. No, nor even at noonday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you dare to speak thus to <i>me</i>, Stubber!" said the Prince, his
      face covered with a deadly pallor as he spoke, and his white lips
      trembling, but less in passion than in fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why not, sir? Of what value could such a man as I am be to your
      service, if I were not to tell you what you 'll never hear from others,&mdash;the
      plain, simple truth? Is it not clear enough that if I only thought of my
      own benefit, I 'd say whatever you'd like best to hear?&mdash;I'd tell
      you, like Landelli, that the taxes were well paid, or say, as Cerreccio
      did t'other day, that your army would do credit to any state in Europe,
      when he well knew at the time that the artillery was in mutiny from
      arrears of pay, and the cavalry horses dying from short rations!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am well weary of all this," said the Duke, with a sigh. "If the half of
      what I hear of my kingdom every day be but true, my lot in life is worse
      than a galley-slave's. One assures me that I am bankrupt; another calls me
      a vassal of Austria; a third makes me out a Papal spy; and <i>you</i> aver
      that if I venture into the streets of my own town, in the midst of my own
      people, I am almost sure to be assassinated!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take no man's word, sir, for what, while you can see for yourself, it is
      your own duty to ascertain," said Stubber, resolutely. "If you really only
      desire a life of ease and indolence, forgetting what you owe to yourself
      and those you rule over, send for the Austrians. Ask for a brigade and a
      general. You 'll have them for the asking. They 'd come at a word, and try
      your people at the drum-head, and flog and shoot them with as little
      disturbance to you as need be. You may pension off the judges; for a
      court-martial is a far speedier tribunal, and a corporal's guard is quite
      an economy in criminal justice. Trade will not, perhaps, prosper with
      martial law, nor is a state of siege thought favorable to commerce. No
      matter. You 'll sleep safe so long as you keep within doors, and the band
      under your window will rouse the spirit of nationality in your heart, as
      it plays, 'God preserve the Emperor!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget yourself, sir, and you forget <i>me!</i>" said the Duke,
      sternly, as he drew himself up, and threw a look of insolent pride at the
      speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mayhap I do, your Highness," was the ready answer; "and out of that very
      forgetfulness let your Highness take a warning. I say, once more, I
      distrust the people about you; and as to this conspiracy at Carrara, I'll
      wager a round sum on it that it was hatched on t 'other side of the Alps,
      and paid for in good florins of the Holy Roman Empire. At all events, give
      me time to investigate the matter. Let me have till the end of the week to
      examine into it, and, if I find nothing to confirm my views, I 'll say not
      one word against all the measures of precaution that your Council are bent
      on importing from Austria."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take your own way; I promise nothing," said the Duke, haughtily; and,
      with a motion of his hand, dismissed his adviser.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. CARRARA
    </h2>
    <p>
      To all the luxuriant vegetation and cultivated beauty of Massa, glowing in
      the "golden glories" of its orange-groves,&mdash;steeped in the perfume of
      its thousand gardens,&mdash;Carrara offers the very strongest contrast.
      Built in a little cleft of the Apennines, it is begirt with great
      mountains,&mdash;wild, barren, and desolate. Some, dark and precipitous,
      have no traces in their sides but those of the torrents which are formed
      by the melting snows; others show the white caves, as they are called, of
      that pure marble which has made the name of the spot famous throughout
      Europe. High in the mountain sides, escarped amidst rocks, and zig-zagging
      over many a dangerous gorge and deep abyss, are the rough roads trodden by
      the weary oxen,&mdash;trailing along their massive loads and straining
      their stout chests to drag the great white blocks of glittering stone. Far
      down below, crossed and recrossed by splashing torrents, sprinkled with
      the spray of a hundred cataracts, stands Carrara itself,&mdash;a little
      marble city of art, every house a studio, every citizen a sculptor. Hither
      are sent all the marvellous conceptions of genius,&mdash;the models which
      mighty imaginations have begotten,&mdash;to be converted into imperishable
      stone. Here are the grand conceptions gathered for every land and clime,
      treasures destined to adorn the great galleries of nations, or the
      splendid palaces of kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of these studios are of imposing size and vast proportions, and not
      devoid of a certain architectural pretension,&mdash;a group, a figure, or
      a bas-relief usually adorning the space over the door, and by its subject
      giving some indication of the tastes of the proprietor. Thus, Madonnas and
      saints are of frequent occurrence; and the majority of the artists display
      their faith by an image of the saint whose patronage they claim. Others
      exhibit some ideal conception; and a few denote their nationality by the
      bust of their sovereign, or some prince of his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these buildings, a short distance from the town, and so small as to
      be little more than a mere crypt, was distinguished by the chaste and
      simple elegance of its design, and the tasteful ornament with which its
      owner had decorated the most minute details of the building. He was a
      young artist who had arrived in Carrara friendless and unknown, but whose
      abilities had soon obtained for him consideration and employment. At
      first, the tasks intrusted to him were the humbler ones of friezes and
      decorative art; but at length, his skill becoming acknowledged, to his
      hands were confided the choicest conceptions of Danneker, the most rare
      creations of Canova. Little or nothing was known of him; his habits were
      of the strictest seclusion,&mdash;he went into no society, he formed no
      friendships. His solitary life, after a while, ceased to attract any
      notice; and men saw him pass, and come and go, without question,&mdash;almost
      without greeting; and, save when some completed work was about to be
      packed off to its destination, the name of Sebastian Greppi was rarely
      heard in Carrara.
    </p>
    <p>
      His strict retirement had not, however, exempted him from the jealous
      suspicions of the authorities; on the contrary, the seeming mystery of his
      life had sharpened their curiosity and aroused their zeal; and more than
      once was he summoned to the Prefecture to answer some frivolous questions
      about his passport or his means of subsistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on one of these errands that he stood one morning in the
      antechamber of the Podestà's court, awaiting his turn to be called and
      interrogated. The heat of a crowded chamber, the wearisome delay,&mdash;perhaps,
      too, some vexation at the frequency of these irritating calls,&mdash;had
      partially excited him; and when he was at length introduced, his manner
      was confused, and his replies vague and almost wandering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two strangers, whose formal permission to reside were then being filled up
      by a clerk, were accommodated with seats in the room, and listened with no
      slight interest to a course of inquiry so strange and novel to their ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Greppi!" cried the harsh voice of the President, "come forward;" and a
      youth stood up, dressed in the blue blouse of a common workman, and
      wearing the coarse shoes of the very humblest laborer; but yet, in the
      calm dignity of his mien and the mild character of his sad but handsome
      features, already proclaiming that he came of a class whose instincts
      denote good blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Greppi, you have a servant, it would seem, whose name is not in your
      passport. How is this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is an humble friend who shares my fortunes, sir," said the artist.
      "They asked no passport from him when we crossed the Tuscan frontier; and
      he has been here some months without any demand for one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does he assist you in your work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He does, sir, by advice and counsel; but he is not a sculptor. Poor
      fellow! he never dreamed that his presence here could have attracted any
      remark."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His tongue and accent betray a foreign origin, Greppi?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so,&mdash;so do mine, perhaps. Are we the less submissive to the
      laws?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The laws can make themselves respected," said the Podestà, sternly.
      "Where is this man,&mdash;how is he called?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is known as Guglielmo, sir. At this moment he is ill; he has caught
      the fever of the Campagna, and is confined to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall send to ascertain the fact," was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then my word is doubted!" said the youth haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Podestà started, but more in amazement than anger. There was, indeed,
      enough to astonish him in the haughty ejaculation of the poorly clad boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am given to believe that you are not&mdash;as your passport would imply&mdash;a
      native of Capri, nor a Neapolitan born," said the Podestà.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If my passport be regular and my conduct blameless, what have you or any
      one to do with my birthplace? Is there any charge alleged against me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are forgetting where you are, boy; but I may take measures to remind
      you of it," said the Podestà, whispering to a sergeant of the gendarmes at
      his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope I have said nothing that could offend you," said the boy, eagerly;
      "I scarcely know what I have said. My wish is to submit myself in all
      obedience to the laws; to live quietly and follow my trade. If my presence
      here give displeasure to the authorities, I will, however sorry, take my
      departure, though I cannot say whither to." The last words were uttered
      falteringly, and in a kind of soliloquy, and only overheard by the two
      strangers, who now, having received their papers, arose to withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you call at our inn and speak with us? That's my card," said one, as
      he passed out, and gave a visiting-card into the youth's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it without a word; indeed, he was too deeply engaged in his own
      thoughts to pay much attention to the request.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sergeant will accompany you, my good youth, to your lodgings, and
      verify what you have stated as to your companion. To-morrow you will
      appear here again, to answer certain questions we shall put to you as to
      your subsistence, and the means by which you live."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it a crime to have wherewithal to subsist upon?" asked the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He whose means of living are disproportionate to his evident station may
      well be an object of suspicion," said the other, with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who is to say what is my station, or what becomes it? Will <i>you</i>
      take upon you to pronounce upon the question?" cried the boy, boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mayhap it is what I shall do very soon!" was the calm answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then let me have done with this. I'll leave the place as soon as my
      friend be able to bear removal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even that I 'll not promise for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you 'll not detain me here by force?" exclaimed the youth. \
    </p>
    <p>
      A cold, ambiguous smile was the only reply he received to this speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let us see when this restraint is to begin," cried the boy,
      passionately, as he moved towards the door; but no impediment was offered
      to his departure. On the contrary, the servant, at a signal from the
      Prefect, threw wide the two sides of the folding-doors, and the youth
      passed out, down the stairs, and into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind obscured by passion, his heart bursting with indignation, he
      threaded his way through many a narrow lane and alley, till he reached a
      small rustic bridge, crossing over which he ascended a narrow flight of
      steps cut in the solid rock, and gained a little terrace, on which stood a
      small cottage of the humblest kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual in Italy, during the summer-time, the glass sashes of the windows
      had been removed, and the shutters closed. Opening one of these gently
      with his hand, he peeped in, and as suddenly a voice cried out, "Are you
      come back? Oh, how my heart was aching to see you here again! Come in
      quickly, and let me touch your hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment the boy was seated by the bed, where lay a man greatly
      emaciated by sickness, and bearing in his worn features the traces of a
      severe tertian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's going off now," said he, "but the fit was a long one. This morning
      it began at eight o'clock; but I 'm throwing it off now, and I 'll soon be
      better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My poor fellow," said the boy, caressing the cold fingers within his own
      hands, "it was in these midnight rambles of mine you caught the terrible
      malady. As it ever has been, your fidelity is fatal to you. I told you a
      thousand times that I was born to hard luck, and carried more than enough
      to swamp all who might try to succor me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And don't I say, as the ould heathen philosopher did of fortune, 'Nullum
      numen habes, si sit prudentia'?" Is it necessary to say that the speaker
      was Billy Traynor, and the boy his pupil?
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Prudentia</i>," said the youth, scoffingly, "may mean anything, from
      trickery to downright meanness; since, by such acts as these, men grow
      great in life. <i>Prudentia</i> is thrift and self-denial; but it is more
      too,&mdash;it is a compromise between a man's dignity and his worldly
      success&mdash;it is the compact that says, Bear <i>this</i> that <i>that</i>
      may happen; and so I 'll none of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me how you fared with the Prefect," asked Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall hear, and judge for yourself," said the other; and related, as
      well as his memory would serve him, the circumstances of his late
      interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well!" said Billy, "it might be worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew you 'd say so, poor fellow!" said the youth, affectionately; "you
      accept the rubs of life as cheerfully as I take them with impatience. But,
      after all, this is matter of temperament too. <i>You</i> can forgive,&mdash;I
      love better to resist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine is the better philosophy, though," said Billy, "since it will last
      one's lifetime. Forgiveness must dignify old age, when your virtue of
      resistance be no longer possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never wish to reach the time when I may be too old for it," said the
      boy, passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! don't say that. It's not for you to determine how long you are to
      live, nor in what frame of mind years are to find you." He paused, and
      there was a long unbroken silence between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been at the post," said the youth, at last, "and found that
      letter, which, by the Neapolitan postmark, must have been despatched many
      weeks since."
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy Traynor took up the letter, whose seal was yet unbroken, and having
      examined it carefully, returned it to him, saying, "You did n't answer his
      last, I think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; and I half hoped he might have felt offended, and given up the
      correspondence. What have we to do with ambassadors or great ministers,
      Billy? Ours is not the grand highway in life, but the humble path on the
      mountain side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm content if it only lead upwards," said the sick man; and the words
      were uttered firmly, but with the solemn fervor of prayer.

      CHAPTER XXVIII. A NIGHT SCENE
    </h2>
    <p>
      As young Massy&mdash;for so we like best to call him&mdash;sat with the
      letter in his hand, a card fell to the ground from between his fingers,
      and, taking it up, he read the name "Lord Selby."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does this mean, Billy?" asked he; "whom can it belong to? Oh, I
      remember now. There were some strangers at the Podestà's office this
      morning when I was there; and one of them asked me to call at this inn,
      and speak with them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has seen the 'Alcibiades,'" exclaimed Billy, eagerly. "He has been at
      the studio?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How should he?" rejoined the youth. "I have not been there myself for two
      days: here is the key!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has heard of it then,&mdash;of that I'm certain; since he could not be
      in town here an hour without some one telling him of it." Massy smiled
      half sadly, and shook his head. "Go and see him, at all events," said
      Billy; "and be sure to put on your coat and a hat; for one would n't know
      what ye were at all, in that cap and dirty blouse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go as I am, or not at all," said the other, rising. "I am Sebastian
      Greppi, a young sculptor. At least," added he, bitterly, "I have about the
      same right to that name that I have to any other." He turned abruptly away
      as he spoke, and gained the open air. There for a few moments he stood
      seemingly irresolute, and then, wiping away a heavy tear that had fallen
      on his cheek, he slowly descended the steps towards the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the inn, the strangers had just dined, but left word that
      when he called he should be introduced at once, and Massy followed the
      waiter into a small garden, where, in a species of summer-house, they were
      seated at their wine. One of them arose courteously as the youth came
      forward, and placing a chair for him, and filling out a glass of wine,
      invited him to join them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give him one of your cigars, Baynton," said the other; "they are better
      than mine." And Massy accepted, and began smoking without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That fellow at the police-office gave you no further trouble, I hope,"
      said my lord, in a half-languid tone, and with that amount of difficulty
      that showed he was no master of Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Massy; "for the present, he has done nothing more. I 'm not
      so certain, however, that to-morrow or next day I shall not be ordered
      away from this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On what grounds?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suspicion,&mdash;Heavens knows of what!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's infamous, I say. Eh, Baynton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Detestable," muttered the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And whereto can you go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I scarcely know as yet, since the police are in communication throughout
      the whole Peninsula, and they transmit your character from state to
      state."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They 'd not credit this in England, Baynton!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not a word of it!" rejoined the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 're a Neapolitan, I think I heard him say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So my passport states."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, he won't say that he is one, though," interposed his Lordship, in
      English. "Do you mind that, Baynton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I remarked it," was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how came you here originally?" asked Selby, turning towards the
      youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came here to study and to work. There is always enough to be had to do
      in this place, copying the works of great masters; and at one's spare
      moments there is time to try something of one's own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And have you done anything of that kind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I have begun. I have attempted two or three."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We should like to see them,&mdash;eh, Baynton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, when we 've finished our wine. It's not far off, is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A few minutes' walk; but not worth even that, when the place is full of
      things really worth seeing. There's Danneker's 'Bathing Nymph,' and
      Canova's 'Dead Cupid,' and Rauch's 'Antigone,' all within reach."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mind that, Baynton; we must see all these to-morrow. Could you come about
      with us, and show us what we ought to see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who knows if I shall not be on the road to-morrow?" said the youth,
      smiling faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I think not, if there's really nothing against you; if it's only mere
      suspicion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so!" said the other, and drank off his wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are able to make a good thing of it here,&mdash;by copying, I
      mean?" asked his Lordship, languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can live," said the youth; "and as I labor very little and idle a great
      deal, that is saying enough, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm not sure the police are not right about him, after all, Baynton,"
      said his Lordship; "he doesn't seem to care much about his trade;" and
      Massy was unable to repress a smile at the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't understand English, do you?" asked Selby, with a degree of
      eagerness very unusual to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I am English by birth," was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "English! and how came you to call yourself a Neapolitan? What was the
      object of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wished to excite less notice and less observation here, and, if
      possible, to escape the jealousy with which Englishmen are regarded by the
      authorities; for this I obtained a passport at Naples."
    </p>
    <p>
      Baynton eyed him suspiciously as he spoke, and as he sipped his wine
      continued to regard him with a keen glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how did you manage to get a Neapolitan passport?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our Minister, Sir Horace Upton, managed that for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you are known to Sir Horace, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      A quick interchange of looks between my lord and his friend showed that
      they were by no means satisfied that the young sculptor was simply a
      worker in marble and a fashioner in modelling-clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you heard from Sir Horace lately?" asked Lord Selby.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I received this letter to-day, but I have not read it;" and he showed the
      unopened letter as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The police may, then, have some reasonable suspicions about your
      residence here," said his Lordship, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord," said Massy, rising, "I have had enough of this kind of
      examination from the Podestà himself this morning, not to care to pass my
      evening in a repetition of it. Who I am, what I am, and with what object
      here, are scarcely matters in which you have any interest, and assuredly
      were not the subjects on which I expected you should address me. I beg now
      to take my leave." He moved towards the garden as he spoke, bowing
      respectfully to each.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a moment; pray don't go,&mdash;sit down again,&mdash;I never meant,&mdash;of
      course I could n't mean so,&mdash;eh, Baynton?" said his Lordship,
      stammering in great confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not," broke in Baynton; "his Lordship's inquiries were really
      prompted by a sincere desire to serve you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so,&mdash;a sincere desire to serve you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In fact, seeing you, as I may say, in the toils."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly so,&mdash;in the toils."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He thought very naturally that his influence and his position might,&mdash;you
      understand,&mdash;for these fellows know perfectly well what an English
      peer is,&mdash;they take a proper estimate of the power of Great Britain."
    </p>
    <p>
      His Lordship nodded assentingly, as though any stronger corroboration
      might not be exactly graceful on his part, and Baynton went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you perfectly comprehend why,&mdash;you see at once the whole thing;
      and I 'm sure, instead of feeling any soreness or irritation at my lord's
      interference, that in point of fact&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so," broke in his Lordship, pressing Massy into a seat at his side,&mdash;"just
      so; that's it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It requires no ordinary tact for any man to reseat himself at a table from
      which he has risen in anger or irritation, and Massy had far too little
      knowledge of life to overcome this difficulty gracefully. He tried,
      indeed, to seem at ease, he endeavored even to be cheerful; but the
      efforts were all unsuccessful. My lord was no very acute observer at any
      time; he was, besides, so constitutionally indolent that the company which
      exacted least was ever the most palatable to him. As for Baynton, he was
      only too happy whenever least reference was made to his opinion, and so
      they sat and sipped their wine with wonderfully little converse between
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have a statue, or a group, or something or other, have n't you?" said
      my lord, after a very long interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a half-finished model," said the youth, not without a certain
      irritation at the indifference of his questioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scarcely light enough to look at it to-night,&mdash;eh, Baynton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scarcely!" was the dry answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can go in the morning though, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other nodded a cool assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      My lord now filled his glass, drank it off, and refilled, with the air of
      a man nerving himself for a great undertaking,&mdash;and such was indeed
      the case. He was about to deliver himself of a sentiment, and the occasion
      was one to which Baynton could not lend his assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been thinking," said he, "that if that same estate we spoke of,
      Baynton,&mdash;that Welsh property, you know, and that thing in Ireland,&mdash;should
      fall in, I 'd buy some statues and have a gallery!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Devilish costly work you'd find it," muttered Baynton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I suppose it is,&mdash;not more so than a racing stable, after
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides, I look upon that property&mdash;if it does ever come to me&mdash;as
      a kind of windfall; it was one of those pieces of fortune one could n't
      have expected, you know." Then, turning towards the youth, as if to
      apologize for a discussion in which he could take no part, he said, "We
      were talking of a property which, by the eccentricity of its owner, may
      one day become mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And which doubtless some other had calculated on inheriting," said the
      youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that may be very true; I never thought about that,&mdash;eh,
      Baynton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should you?" was the short response.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gain and loss, loss and gain," muttered the youth, moodily, "are the laws
      of life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, Baynton, what a jolly moonlight there is out there in the garden!
      Would n't it be a capital time this to see your model, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you are disposed to take the trouble," said the youth, rising, and
      blushing modestly; and the others stood up at the same moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing passed between them as they followed the young sculptor through
      many an intricate by-way and narrow lane, and at last reached the little
      stream on whose bank stood his studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have we here!" exclaimed Baynton as he saw it; "is this a little
      temple?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is my workshop," said the boy, proudly, and produced the key to open
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had he crossed the threshold, however, than his foot struck a
      roll of papers, and, stooping down, he caught up a large placard, headed,
      "Morte al Tiranno," in large capitals. Holding the sheet up to the
      moonlight, he saw that it contained a violent and sanguinary appeal to the
      wildest passions of the Carbonari,&mdash;one of those savage exhortations
      to bloodshedding which were taken from the terrible annals of the French
      Revolution. Some of these bore the picture of the guillotine at top,
      others were headed with cross poniards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are all these about?" asked Baynton, as he took up three or four of
      them in his hand; but the youth, overcome with terror, could make no
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These are all <i>sans-culotte</i> literature, I take it," said his
      Lordship; but the youth was stupefied and silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has there been any treachery at work here?" asked Baynton. "Is there a
      scheme to entrap you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth nodded a melancholy and slow assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should you be obnoxious to these people? Have you any enemies
      amongst them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot tell," gloomily muttered the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this is your statue?" said Baynton, as, opening a large shutter, he
      suffered a flood of moonlight to fall on the figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0002" id="linkimage-0002">
      <!-- IMG --></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/glen0242.jpg" alt="242 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      "Fine!&mdash;a work of great merit, Baynton," broke in his Lordship, whose
      apathy was at last overcome by admiration. But the youth stood regardless
      of their comments, his eyes bent upon the ground; nor did he heed them as
      they moved from side to side, examining the statue in all its details, and
      in words of high praise speaking their approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll buy this," muttered his Lordship. "I'll give him an order, too, for
      another work,&mdash;leaving the subject to himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A clever fellow, certainly," replied the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom does he mean the figure to represent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is Alcibiades as he meets his death," broke in the youth; "he is
      summoned to the door as though to welcome a friend, and he falls pierced
      by a poisoned arrow,&mdash;there is but legend to warrant the fact. I
      cared little for the incident,&mdash;I was full of the man, as he
      contended with seven chariots in the Olympic games, and proudly rode the
      course with his glittering shield of ivory and gold, and his waving locks
      all perfumed. I thought of him in his gorgeous panoply, and his
      voluptuousness; lion-hearted and danger-seeking, pampering the very flesh
      he offered to the spears of the enemy. I pictured him to my mind,
      embellishing life with every charm, and daring death in every shape,&mdash;beautiful
      as Apollo, graceful as the bounding Mercury, bold as Achilles, the lion's
      whelp, as Æschylus calls him. This," added he, in a tone of depression,&mdash;"this
      is but a sorry version of what my mind had conceived."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I arrest you, Sebastiano Greppi," said a voice from behind; and suddenly
      three gendarmes surrounded the youth, who stood still and speechless with
      terror, while a mean-looking man in shabby black gathered up the printed
      proclamations that lay about, and commenced a search for others throughout
      the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask them will they take our bail for his appearance, Baynton," said my
      lord, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No use,&mdash;they 'd only laugh at us," was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can we be of any service to you? Is there anything we can do?" asked his
      Lordship of the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not communicate with the prisoner, signore," cried the
      brigadier, "if you don't wish to share his arrest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this, doubtless," said the man in black, standing, and holding up the
      lantern to view the statue,&mdash;"this is the figure of Liberty we have
      heard of, pierced by the deadly arrow of Tyranny!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hear them!" cried the boy, in wild indignation, addressing the
      Englishmen; "you hear how these wretches draw their infamous allegations!
      But this shall not serve them as a witness." And with a spring he seized a
      large wooden mallet from the floor, and dashed the model in pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cry of horror and rage burst from the bystanders, and as the Englishmen
      stooped in sorrow over the broken statue, the gendarmes secured the boy's
      wrists with a stout cord, and led him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go after them, Baynton; tell them he is an Englishman, and that if he
      comes to harm they 'll hear of it!" cried my lord, eagerly; while he
      muttered in a lower tone, "I think we might knock these fellows over and
      liberate him at once, eh, Baynton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No use if we did," replied the other; "they'd overpower us afterwards.
      Come along to the inn; we'll see about it in the morning."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX. A COUNCIL OF STATE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a fine mellow evening of the late autumn as two men sat in a large
      and handsomely furnished chamber opening upon a vast garden. There was
      something in the dim half-light, the heavily perfumed air, rich with the
      odor of the orange and the lime, and the stillness, that imparted a sense
      of solemnity to the scene, where, indeed, few words were interchanged, and
      each seemed to ponder long after every syllable of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have no mysteries with our reader, and we hasten to say that one of
      these personages was the Chevalier Stubber,&mdash;confidential minister of
      the Duke of Massa; the other was our old acquaintance Billy Traynor. If
      there was some faint resemblance in the fortunes of these two men, who,
      sprung from the humblest walks of life, had elevated themselves by their
      talents to a more exalted station, there all likeness between them ended.
      Each represented, in some of the very strongest characteristics, a
      nationality totally unlike that of the other: the Saxon, blunt, imperious,
      and decided; the Celt, subtle, quick-sighted, and suspicious, distrustful
      of all, save his own skill in a moment of difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you have not told me his real name yet," said the Chevalier, as he
      slowly smoked his cigar, and spoke with the half-listlessness of a
      careless inquirer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that, sir," said Billy, cautiously; "I don't see any need of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor your own, either," remarked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor even that, sir," responded Billy, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It comes to this, then, my good friend," rejoined Stubber, "that, having
      got yourself into trouble, and having discovered, by the aid of a
      countryman, that a little frankness would serve you greatly, you prefer to
      preserve a mystery that I could easily penetrate if I cared for it, to
      speaking openly and freely, as a man might with one of his own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have no mysteries, sir. We have family secrets that don't regard any
      one but ourselves. My young ward, or pupil, whichever I ought to call him,
      has, maybe, his own reasons for leading a life of unobtrusive obscurity,
      and what one may term an umbrageous existence. It's enough for me to know
      that, to respect it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, all this is very well if you were at liberty, or if you stood
      on the soil of your own country; but remember where you are now, and what
      accusations are hanging over you. I have here beside me very grave charges
      indeed,&mdash;constant and familiar intercourse with leaders of the
      Carbonari&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We don't know one of them," broke in Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Correspondence with others beyond the frontier," continued the Chevalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor that either," interrupted Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Treasonable placards found by the police in the very hands of the
      accused; insolent conduct to the authorities when arrested; attempted
      escape: all these duly certified on oath."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Devil may care for that; oaths are as plenty with these blaguards as
      clasp-knives, and for the same purpose too. Here's what it is, now," said
      he, crossing his arms on the table, and staring steadfastly at the other:
      "we came here to study and work, to perfect ourselves in the art of
      modellin', with good studies around us; and, more than all, a quiet,
      secluded little spot, with nothing to distract our attention, or take us
      out of a mind for daily labor. That we made a mistake, is clear enough.
      Like everywhere else in this fine country, there's nothing but tyrants on
      one side, and assassins on the other; and meek and humble as we lived, we
      could n't escape the thievin' blaguards of spies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know the handwriting of this address?" said the Chevalier, showing
      a sealed letter directed to Sebastiano Greppi, Sculptore, Carrara.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe I do, maybe I don't," was the gruff reply. "Won't you let me finish
      what I was savin'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This letter was found in the possession of the young prisoner, and is of
      some consequence," continued the other, totally inattentive to the
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose a letter is always of consequence to him it's meant for," was
      the half-sulky reply. "Sure you 're not goin' to break the seal&mdash;sure
      you don't mean to read it!" exclaimed he, almost springing from his seat
      as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think I'd ask your permission for anything I think fit to do, my
      worthy fellow," said the other, sternly; and then, passing across the
      room, he summoned a gendarme, who waited at the door, to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take this man back to the Fortezza," said he, calmly; and while Billy
      Traynor slowly followed the guard, the other seated himself leisurely at
      the table, lighted his candles, and perused the letter. Whether
      disappointed by the contents, or puzzled by the meaning, he sat long
      pondering with the document before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in the night when a messenger came to say that his Highness
      desired to see him; and Stubber arose at once, and hastened to the Duke's
      chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a room studiously plain and simple in all its furniture, and on a low,
      uncurtained bed, lay the Prince, half dressed, a variety of books and
      papers littering the table, and even the floor at his side. Maps, prints,
      colored drawings,&mdash;some representing views of Swiss scenery, others
      being portraits of opera celebrities,&mdash;were mingled with illuminated
      missals and richly-embossed rosaries; while police reports, petitions,
      rose-colored billets and bon-bons, made up a mass of confusion wonderfully
      typical of the illustrious individual himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stubber had scarcely crossed the threshold of the room when he appeared to
      appreciate the exact frame of his master's mind. It was the very essence
      of his tact to catch in a moment the ruling impulse which swayed for a
      time that strange and vacillating nature, and he had but to glance at him
      to divine what was passing within.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So then," broke out the Prince, "here we are actually in the very midst
      of revolution. Marocchi has been stabbed in the Piazza of Carrara. Is it a
      thing to laugh at, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The wound has only been fatal to the breast of his surtout, your
      Highness; and so adroitly given, besides, that it does not correspond with
      the incision in his waistcoat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You distrust everyone and everything, Stubber; and, of course, you
      attribute all that is going forward to the police."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I do, your Highness. They predict events with too much accuracy
      not to have a hand in their fulfilment. I knew three weeks ago when this
      outbreak was to occur, who was to be assassinated,&mdash;since that is the
      phrase for Marocchi's mock wound,&mdash;who was to be arrested, and the
      exact nature of the demand the Council would make of your Royal Highness
      to suppress the troubles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what was that?" asked the Duke, grasping a paper in his hand as he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An Austrian division, with a half-battery of field-artillery, a
      judge-advocate to try the prisoners, and a provost-marshal to shoot them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you 'd have me believe that all these disturbances are deliberate
      plots of a party who desire Austrian influence in the Duchy?" cried the
      Duke, eagerly. "There may be really something in what you suspect. Here's
      a letter I have just received from La Sabloukoff,&mdash;she 's always
      keen-sighted; and <i>she</i> thinks that the Court at Vienna is playing
      out here the game that they have not courage to attempt in Lombardy. What
      if this Wahnsdorf was a secret agent in the scheme, eh, Stubber?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stubber started with well-affected astonishment, and appeared as if
      astounded at the keen acuteness of the Duke's suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh!" cried his Highness, in evident delight. "That never occurred to <i>you</i>,
      Stubber? I'd wager there's not a man in the Duchy could have hit that plot
      but myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stubber nodded sententiously, without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never liked that fellow," resumed the Duke. "I always had my suspicion
      about that half-reckless, wasteful manner he had. I know that I was alone
      in this opinion, eh, Stubber? It never struck <i>you?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never! your Highness, never!" replied Stubber, frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't show you the Sabloukoff's letter, Stubber, there are certain
      private details for my own eye alone; but she speaks of a young sculptor
      at Carrara, a certain&mdash;Let me find his name. Ah! here it is,
      Sebastian Greppi, a young artist of promise, for whom she bespeaks our
      protection. Can you make him out, and let us see him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stubber bowed in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will give him an order for something. There's a pedestal in the
      flower-garden where the Psyche stood. You remember, I smashed the Psyche,
      because it reminded me of Camilla Monti. He shall design a figure for that
      place. I 'd like a youthful Bacchus. I have a clever sketch of one
      somewhere; and it shall be tinted,&mdash;slightly tinted. The Greeks
      always colored their statues. Strange enough, too; for, do you remark,
      Stubber, they never represented the iris of the eye, which the Romans
      invariably did. And yet, if you observe closely, you'll see that the
      eyelid implies the direction of the eye more accurately than in the Roman
      heads. I 'm certain you never detected what I 'm speaking of, eh,
      Stubber?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stubber candidly confessed that he had not, and listened patiently while
      his master descanted critically on the different styles of art, and his
      own especial tact and skill in discriminating between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll look after these police returns, then, Stubber," said he, at last.
      "You'll let these people understand that we can suffice for the
      administration of our own duchy. We neither want advice from Metternich,
      nor battalions from Radetzky. The laws here are open to every man; and if
      we have any claim to the gratitude of our people, it rests on our
      character for justice."
    </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke with a degree of earnestness that indicated sincerity,
      there was something in the expression of his eye&mdash;a half-malicious
      drollery in its twinkle&mdash;that made it exceedingly difficult to say
      whether his words were uttered in honesty of purpose, or in mere mockery
      and derision. Whether Stubber rightly understood their import is more than
      we are able to say; but it is very probable that he was, with all his
      shrewdness, mystified by one whose nature was a puzzle to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let Marocchi return to Carrara. Say we have taken the matter into our own
      hands. Change the brigadier in command of the gendarmerie there. Tell the
      <i>canonico</i> Baldetti that we look to <i>him</i> and his deacons for
      true reports of any movement that is plotting in the town. I take no steps
      with regard to Wahnsdorf for the present, but let him be closely watched.
      And then, Stubber, send off an <i>estafetta</i> to Pietra Santa for the
      ortolans, for I think we have earned our breakfast by all this attention
      to state affairs." And then, with a laugh whose accents gave not the very
      faintest clew to its meaning, he lay back on his pillow again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And these two prisoners, your Highness, what is to be done with them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever you please, Stubber. Give them the third-class cross of Massa,
      or a month's imprisonment, at your own good pleasure. Only, no more
      business,&mdash;no papers to sign, no schemes to unravel; and so good
      night." And the Chevalier retired at once from a presence which he well
      knew resented no injury so unmercifully as any invasion of his personal
      comfort.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. THE LIFE THEY LED AT MASSA
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was with no small astonishment young Massy heard that he and his
      faithful follower were not alone restored to liberty, but that an order of
      his Highness had assigned them a residence in a portion of the palace, and
      a promise of future employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This smacks of Turkish rather than of European rule," said the youth. "In
      prison yesterday,&mdash;in a palace to-day. My own fortunes are wayward
      enough, Heaven knows, not to require any additional ingredient of
      uncertainty. What think you, Traynor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm thinkin'," said Billy, gravely, "that as the bastes of the field are
      guided by their instincts to objects that suit their natures, so man
      ought, by his reason, to be able to pilot himself in difficulties,&mdash;choosin'
      this, avoidin' that; seein' by the eye of prophecy where a road would lead
      him, and makin' of what seem the accidents of life, steppin'-stones to
      fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way does your theory apply here?" cried the other. "How am I to
      guess whither this current may carry me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events, there's no use wastin' your strength by swimmin' against
      it," rejoined Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be the slave of some despot's whim,&mdash;the tool of a caprice that
      may elevate me to-day, and to-morrow sentence me to the gallows. The
      object I have set before myself in life is to be independent. Is this,
      then, the road to it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 're tryin' to be what no man ever was, or will be, to the world's
      end, then," said Billy. "Sure it's the very nature and essence of our life
      here below that we are dependent one on the other for kindness, for
      affection, for material help in time of difficulty, for counsel in time of
      doubt. The rich man and the poor one have their mutual dependencies; and
      if it was n't so, cowld-hearted and selfish as the world is, it would be
      five hundred times worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mistake my meaning," said Massy, sternly, "as you often do, to read
      me a lesson on a text of your own. When I spoke of independence, I meant
      freedom from the serfdom of another's charity. I would that my life here,
      at least, should be of my own procuring."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>I</i> get mine from <i>you</i>," said Traynor, calmly, "and never felt
      myself a slave on that account."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me, my dear, kind friend. I could hate myself if I gave you a
      moment's pain. This temper of mine does not improve by time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's one way to conquer it. Don't be broodin' on what's within. Don't
      be magnifyin' your evil fortunes to your own heart till you come to think
      the world all little, and yourself all great. Go out to your daily labor,
      whatever it be, with a stout spirit to do your best, and a thankful,
      grateful heart that you are able to do it. Never let it out of your mind
      that if there's many a one your inferior, winnin' his way up to fame and
      fortune before you, there's just as many better than you toilin' away
      unseen and unnoticed, wearin' out genius in a garret, and carryin' off a
      Godlike intellect to an obscure grave!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You talk to me as though my crying sin were an overweening vanity," said
      the youth, half angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's one of them," said Billy; and the blunt frankness of the
      avowal threw the boy into a fit of laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You certainly do not intend to spoil me, Billy," said he, still laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why would I do what so many is ready to do for nothing? What does the
      crowd that praise the work of a young man of genius care where they 're
      leading him to? It's like people callin' out to a strong swimmer, 'Go out
      farther and farther,&mdash;out to the open say, where the waves is rollin'
      big, and the billows is roughest; that's worthy of you, in your strong
      might and your stout limbs. Lave the still water and the shallows to the
      weak and the puny. <i>Your</i> course is on the mountain wave, over the
      bottomless ocean.' It's little they think if he's ever to get back again.
      'T is their boast and their pride that they said, 'Go on;' and when his
      cold corpse comes washed to shore, all they have is a word of derision and
      scorn for one who ventured beyond his powers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How you cool down one's ardor; with what pleasure you check every impulse
      that nerves one's heart for high daring!" said the youth, bitterly. "These
      eternal warnings&mdash;these never-ending forebodings of failure&mdash;are
      sorry stimulants to energy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is n't it better for you to have all your reverses at the hands of a
      crayture as humble as me?" said Billy, while the tears glistened in his
      eyes. "What good am I, except for this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the boy's arms were around him, while he cried out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, forgive me once more, and let me try if I cannot amend a temper
      that any but yourself had grown weary of correcting. I'll work&mdash;I'll
      labor&mdash;I'll submit&mdash;I'll accept the daily rubs of life, as
      others take them, and you shall be satisfied with me. We shall go back to
      all our old pursuits, my dear Billy. I'll join all your ecstasies over
      Æschylus, and believe as much as I can of Herodotus, to please you. You
      shall lead me to all the wonders of the stars, and dazzle me with the
      brightness of visions that my intellect is lost in; and in revenge I only
      ask that you should sit with me in the studio, and read to me some of
      those songs of Horace that move the heart like old wine. Shall I own to
      you what it is which sways me thus uncertainly,&mdash;jarring every chord
      of my existence, making life a sea of stormy conflict? Shall I tell you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He grasped the other's hand with both his own as he spoke, and, while his
      lips quivered in strong emotion, went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is this, then. I cannot forget, do all that I will, I cannot root out
      of my heart what I once believed myself to be. You know what I mean. Well,
      there it is still, like the sense of a wrong or foul injustice, as though
      I had been robbed and cheated of what never was mine! This contrast
      between the life my earliest hopes had pictured, and that which I am
      destined to, never leaves me. All your teachings&mdash;and I have seen how
      devotedly you have addressed yourself to this lesson&mdash;have not
      eradicated from my nature the proud instincts that guided my childhood.
      Often and often have you warmed my blood by thoughts of a triumph to be
      achieved by me hereafter,&mdash;how men should recognize me as a genius,
      and elevate me to honors and rewards; and yet would I barter such success,
      ten thousand times told, for an hour of that high station that comes by
      birth alone, independent of all effort,&mdash;the heirloom of deeds
      chronicled centuries back, whose actors have been dust for ages. That is
      real pride," cried he, enthusiastically, "and has no alloy of the petty
      vanity that mingles with the sense of a personal triumph."
    </p>
    <p>
      Traynor hung his head heavily as the youth spoke, and a gloomy melancholy
      settled on his features; the sad conviction came home to him of all his
      counsels being fruitless, all his teachings in vain; and as the boy sat
      wrapped in a wild, dreamy revery of ancestral greatness, the humble
      peasant brooded darkly over the troubles such a temperament might evoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is agreed, then," cried Massy, suddenly, "that we are to accept of
      this great man's bounty, live under his roof, and eat his bread. Well, I
      accede,&mdash;as well his as another's. Have you seen the home they
      destine for us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's a real paradise, and in a garden that would beat Adam's now,"
      exclaimed Traynor; "for there's marble fountains, and statues, and
      temples, and grottos in it; and it's as big as a prairie, and as wild as a
      wilderness. And, better than all, there's a little pathway leads to a
      private stair that goes up into the library of the palace,&mdash;a spot
      nobody ever enters, and where you may study the whole day long without
      hearin' a footstep. All the books is there that ever was written, and
      manuscripts without end besides; and the Minister says I'm to have my own
      kay, and go in and out whenever I plaze. 'And if there's anything
      wantin',' says be, 'just order it on a slip of paper and send it to me,
      and you 'll have it at once.' When I asked if I ought to spake to the
      librarian himself, he only laughed, and said, 'That's me; but I'm never
      there. Take my word for it, Doctor, you 'll have the place to yourself.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke truly. Billy Traynor had it, indeed, to himself. There, the gray
      dawn of morning, and the last shadows of evening, ever found him, seated
      in one of those deep, cell-like recesses of the windows; the table, the
      seats, the very floor littered with volumes which, revelling in the luxury
      of wealth, he had accumulated around him. His greedy avidity for knowledge
      knew no bounds. The miser's thirst for gold was weak in comparison with
      that intense craving that seized upon him. Historians, critics, satirists,
      poets, dramatists, metaphysicians, never came amiss to a mind bent on
      acquiring. The life he led was like the realization of a glorious dream,&mdash;the
      calm repose, the perfect stillness of the spot, the boundless stores that
      lay about him; the growing sense of power, as day by day his intellect
      expanded; new vistas opened themselves before him, and new and unproved
      sources of pleasure sprang up in his nature. The never-ending variety gave
      a zest, too, to his labors that averted all weariness; and at last he
      divided his time ingeniously, alternating grave and difficult subjects
      with lighter topics,&mdash;making, as he said himself, "Aristophanes
      digest Plato."
    </p>
    <p>
      And what of young Massy all this while? His life was a dream, too, but of
      another and very different kind. Visions of a glorious future alternated
      with sad and depressing thoughts; high darings, and hopeless views of what
      lay before him, came and went, and went and came again. The Duke, who had
      just taken his departure for some watering-place in Germany, gave him an
      order for certain statues, the models for which were to be ready by his
      return,&mdash;at least, in that sketchy state of which clay is even more
      susceptible than canvas. The young artist chafed and fretted under the
      restraint of an assigned task. It was gall to his haughty nature to be
      told that his genius should accept dictation, and his fancy be fettered by
      the suggestions of another. If he tried to combat this rebellious spirit,
      and addressed himself steadily to labor, he found that his imagination
      grew sluggish, and his mind uncreative. The sense of servitude oppressed
      him; and though he essayed to subdue himself to the condition of an humble
      artist, the old pride still rankled in his heart, and spirited him to a
      haughty resistance. His days thus passed over in vain attempts to work, or
      still more unprofitable lethargy. He lounged through the deserted garden,
      or lay, half-dreamily, in the long, deep grass, listening to the cicala,
      or watching the emerald-backed lizards as they lay basking in the sun. He
      drank in all the soft voluptuous influences of a climate which steeps the
      senses in a luxurious stupor, making the commonest existence a toil, but
      giving to mere indolence all the zest of a rich enjoyment. Sometimes he
      wandered into the library, and noiselessly drew nigh the spot where Billy
      sat deeply busied in his books. He would gaze silently, half curiously, at
      the poor fellow, and then steal noiselessly away, pondering on the
      blessings of that poor peasant's nature, and wondering what in his own
      organization had denied him the calm happiness of this humble man's life.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. AT MASSA
    </h2>
    <p>
      Billy Traynor sat, deeply sunk in study, in the old recess of the palace
      library. A passage in the "Antigone" had puzzled him, and the table was
      littered with critics and commentators, while manuscript notes, scrawled
      in the most rude hand, lay on every side. He did not perceive, in his
      intense preoccupation, that Massy had entered and taken the place directly
      in front of him. There the youth sat gazing steadfastly at the patient and
      studious features before him. It was only when Traynor, mastering the
      difficulty that had so long opposed him, broke out into an enthusiastic
      declamation of the text that Massy, unable to control the impulse, laughed
      aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long are you there? I never noticed you comin' in," said Billy,
      half-shamed at his detected ardor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But a short time; I was wondering at&mdash;ay, Billy, and was envying,
      too&mdash;the concentrated power in which you address yourself to your
      task. It is the real secret of all success, and somehow it is a frame of
      mind I cannot achieve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is the boy Bacchus goin' on?" asked Billy, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I broke him up yesterday, and it is like a weight off my heart that his
      curly bullet head and sensual lips are not waiting for me as I enter the
      studio."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the Cleopatra?" asked Traynor, still more anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Smashed,&mdash;destroyed. Shall I own to you, Billy, I see at last myself
      what you have so often hinted to me,&mdash;I have no genius for the work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never said,&mdash;I never thought so," cried the other; "I only
      insisted that nothing was to be done without labor,&mdash;hard,
      unflinching labor; that easy successes were poor triumphs, and bore no
      results."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There,&mdash;there, I'll hear that sermon no more. I'd not barter the
      freedom of my own unfettered thoughts, as they come and go, in hours of
      listless idleness, for all the success you ever promised me. There are men
      toil elevates,&mdash;me it wearies to depression, and brings no
      compensation in the shape of increased power. Mine is an unrewarding clay,&mdash;that's
      the whole of it. Cultivation only develops the rank weeds which are deep
      sown in the soil. I'd like to travel,&mdash;to visit some new land, some
      scene where all association with the past shall be broken. What say you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm ready, and at your orders," said Traynor, closing his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "East or west, then, which shall it be? If sometimes my heart yearns for
      the glorious scenes of Palestine, full of memories that alone satisfy the
      soul's longings, there are days when I pant for the solitude of the vast
      savannas of the New World. I feel as if to know one's self thoroughly,
      one's nature should be tested by the perils and exigencies of a life
      hourly making some demand on courage and ingenuity. The hunter's life does
      this. What say you,&mdash;shall we try it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm ready," was the calm reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have means for such an enterprise, have we not? You told me, some
      short time past, that nearly the whole of our last year's allowance was
      untouched."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's all there to the good," said Billy; "a good round sum too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us get rid of all needless equipment, then," cried Massy, "and only
      retain what beseems a prairie life. Sell everything, or give it away at
      once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave all that to me,&mdash;I'll manage everything; only say when you
      make up your mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it is made up. I have resolved on the step. Few can decide so
      readily; for I leave neither home nor country behind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't say that," burst in Billy; "here's myself, the poorest crayture
      that walks the earth, that never knew where he was born or who nursed him,
      yet even to me there's the tie of a native land,&mdash;there's the soil
      that reared warriors and poets and orators that I heard of when a child,
      and gloried in as a man; and, better than that, there's the green meadows
      and the leafy valleys where kind-hearted men and women live and labor,
      spakin' our own tongue and feelin' our own feelin's, and that, if we saw
      to-morrow, we 'd know were our own,&mdash;heart and hand our own. The
      smell of the yellow furze, under a griddle of oaten bread, would be
      sweeter to me than all the gales of Araby the Blest; for it would remind
      me of the hearth I had my share of, and the roof that covered me when I
      was alone in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy buried his face in his hands and made no answer. At last, raising
      up his head, he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us try this life; let us see if action be not better than mere
      thought. The efforts of intellect seem to inspire a thirst there is no
      slaking. Sleep brings no rest after them. I long for the sense of some
      strong peril which, over, gives the proud feeling of a goal reached,&mdash;a
      feat accomplished."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go wherever you like; I'll be whatever you want me," said Billy,
      affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us lose no time, then. I would not that my present ardor should cool
      ere we have begun our plan. What day is this? The seventh. Well, on the
      eighteenth there is a ship sails from Genoa for Porto Rico. It was the
      announcement set my heart a-thinking of the project. I dreamed of it two
      entire nights. I fancied myself walking the deck on a starlit night, and
      framing all my projects for the future. The first thing I saw next morning
      was the same placard, 'The "Colombo" will sail for Porto Rico on Friday,
      the eighteenth.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An unlucky day," muttered Billy, interrupting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have fallen upon few that were otherwise," said Massy, gloomily;
      "besides," he added, after a pause, "I have no faith in omens, or any care
      for superstitions. Come, let us set about our preparations. Do <i>you</i>
      bethink you how to rid ourselves of all useless encumbrances here. Be it
      <i>my</i> care to jot down the list of all we shall need for the voyage
      and the life to follow it. Let us see which displays most zeal for the new
      enterprise."
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy Traynor addressed himself with a will to the duty allotted him. He
      rummaged through drawers and desks, destroyed papers and letters, laid
      aside all the articles which he judged suitable for preservation, and then
      hastened off to the studio to arrange for the disposal of the few
      "studies," for they were scarcely more, which remained of Massy's labors.
    </p>
    <p>
      A nearly finished Faun, the head of a Niobe, the arm and hand of a Jove
      launching a thunderbolt, the torso of a dead sailor after shipwreck, lay
      amid fragments of shattered figures, grotesque images, some caricatures of
      his own works, and crude models of anatomy. The walls were scrawled with
      charcoal drawings of groups,&mdash;one day to be fashioned in sculpture,&mdash;with
      verses from Dante, or lines from Tasso, inscribed beneath; proud resolves
      to a life of labor figured beside stanzas in praise of indolence and
      dreamy abandonment. There were passages of Scripture, too, glorious bursts
      of the poetic rapture of the Psalms, intermingled with quaint remarks on
      life from Jean Paul or Herder. All that a discordant, incoherent nature
      consisted of was there in some shape or other depicted; and as Billy ran
      his eye over this curious journal,&mdash;for such it was,&mdash;he grieved
      over the spirit which had dictated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole object of all his teaching had been to give a purpose to this
      uncertain and wavering nature, and yet everything showed him now that he
      had failed. The blight which had destroyed the boy's early fortunes still
      worked its evil influences, poisoning every healthful effort, and dashing
      with a sense of shame every successful step towards fame and honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe he's right after all," muttered Billy to himself. "The New World is
      the only place for those who have not the roots of an ancient stock to
      hold them in the Old. Men can be there whatever is in them, and they can
      be judged without the prejudices of a class."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having summed up, as it were, his own doubts in this remark, he proceeded
      with his task. While he was thus occupied, Massy entered, and threw
      himself into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, you may give it up, Traynor. Fate is ever against us, do and
      decide on what we will. Your confounded omen of a Friday was right this
      time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean? Have you altered your mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expected you to say so," said the other, bitterly. "I knew that I
      should meet with this mockery of my resolution, but it is uncalled for. It
      is not I that have changed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, then, has happened,&mdash;do they refuse your passport?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that either; I never got so far as to ask for it. The misfortune is
      in this wise: on going to the bank to learn the sum that lay to my credit
      and draw for it, I was met by the reply that I had nothing there,&mdash;not
      a shilling. Before I could demand how this could be the case, the whole
      truth suddenly flashed across my memory, and I recalled to mind how one
      night, as I lay awake, the thought occurred to me that it was base and
      dishonorable in me, now that I was come to manhood, to accept of the means
      of life from one who felt shame in my connection with him. 'Why,' thought
      I, 'is there to be the bond of dependence where there is no tie of
      affection to soften its severity?' And so I arose from my bed, and wrote
      to Sir Horace, saying that by the same post I should remit to his banker
      at Naples whatever remained of my last year's allowance, and declined in
      future to accept of any further assistance. This I did the same day, and
      never told you of it,&mdash;partly, lest you should try to oppose me in my
      resolve; partly," and here his voice faltered, "to spare myself the pain
      of revealing my motives. And now that I have buoyed my heart up with this
      project, I find myself without means to attempt it. Not that I regret my
      act, or would recall it," cried he, proudly, "but that the sudden
      disappointment is hard to bear. I was feeding my hopes with such projects
      for the future when this stunning news met me, and the thought that I am
      now chained here by necessity has become a torture."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What answer did Sir Horace give to your letter?" asked Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I forget; I believe he never replied to it, or if he did, I have no
      memory of what he said. Stay,&mdash;there was a letter of his taken from
      me when I was arrested at Carrara. The seal was unbroken at the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember the letter was given to the Minister, who has it still in his
      keeping."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What care I," cried Massy, angrily, "in whose hands it may be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Minister is not here now," said Billy, half speaking to himself, "he
      is travelling with the Duke; but when he comes back&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When he comes back!" burst in Massy, impatiently; "with what calm
      philosophy you look forward to a remote future. I tell you that this
      scheme is now a part and parcel of my very existence. I can turn to no
      other project, or journey no other road in life, till at least I shall
      have tried it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is going to work in a more humble fashion," said Billy, calmly.
      "Leave me to dispose of all these odds and ends here&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This trash!" cried the youth, fiercely. "Who would accept it as a gift?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't disparage it; there are signs of genius even in these things; but,
      above all, don't meddle with me, but just leave me free to follow my own
      way. There now, go back and employ yourself preparing for the road; trust
      the rest to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Massy obeyed without speaking. It was not, indeed, that he ventured to
      believe in Traynor's resources, but he was indisposed to further
      discussion, and longed to be in solitude once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late at night when they met again. Charles Massy was seated at a
      window of his room, looking out into the starry blue of a cloudless sky,
      when Traynor sat down beside him. "Well," said he, gently, "it's all done
      and finished. I have sold off everything, and if you will only repair the
      hand of the Faun, which I broke in removing, there's nothing more
      wanting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That much can be done by any one," said Massy, haughtily. "I hope never
      to set eyes on the trumpery things again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I have promised you would do it," said Traynor, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how&mdash;by what right could you pledge yourself for my labor? Nay,"
      cried he, suddenly changing the tone in which he spoke, "knowing my wilful
      nature, how could you answer for what I might or might not do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew," said Billy, slowly, "that you had a great project in your head,
      and that to enable you to attempt it, you would scorn to throw all the
      toil upon another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never said I was ashamed of labor," said the youth, reddening with
      shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you had, I would despair of you altogether," rejoined the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what is it that I have to do?" said Massy, bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is to remodel the arm, for I don't think you can mend it; but you 'll
      see it yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is the figure,&mdash;in the studio?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; it is in a small pavilion of a villa just outside the gates. It was
      while I was conveying it there it met this misfortune. There's the name of
      the villa on that card. You 'll find the garden gate open, and by taking
      the path through the olive wood you 'll be there in a few minutes; for I
      must go over to-morrow to Carrara with the Niobe; the Academy has bought
      it for a model."
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight start of surprise and a faint flush bespoke the proud
      astonishment with which he heard of this triumph; but he never spoke a
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you had any pride in your works, you'd be delighted to see where the
      Faun is to be placed. It is in a garden, handsomer even than this here,
      with terraces rising one over the other, and looking out on the blue sea,
      from the golden strand of Via Reggio down to the headlands above Spezia.
      The great olive wood in the vast plain lies at your feet, and the white
      cliffs of Serravezza behind you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What care I for all this?" said Massy, gloomily. "Benvenuto could afford
      to be in love with his own works,&mdash;<i>I</i> cannot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Traynor saw at once the mood of mind he was in, and stole noiselessly away
      to his room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. THE PAVILION IN THE GARDEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Charles Massy, dressed in the blouse of his daily labor, and with the
      tools of his craft in his hand, set out early in search of the garden
      indicated by Billy Traynor. A sense of hope that it was for the last time
      he was to exercise his art, that a new and more stirring existence was now
      about to open before him, made his step lighter and his spirits higher as
      he went. "Once amid the deep woods, and on the wide plains of the New
      World, I shall dream no more of what judgment men may pass upon my
      efforts. There, if I suffice to myself, I have no other ordeal to meet.
      Perils may try me, but not the whims and tastes of other men."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, fancying an existence of unbounded freedom and unfettered action, he
      speedily traversed the olive wood, and almost ere he knew it found himself
      within the garden. The gorgeous profusion of beautiful flowers, the
      graceful grouping of shrubs, the richly perfumed air, laden with a
      thousand odors, first awoke him from his day dream, and he stood amazed in
      the midst of a scene surpassing all that he had ever conceived of
      loveliness. From the terrace, where under a vine trellis he was standing,
      he could perceive others above him rising on the mountain side, while some
      beneath descended towards the sea, which, blue as a turquoise, lay basking
      and glittering below. A stray white sail or so was to be seen, but there
      was barely wind to shake the olive leaves, and waft the odors of the
      orange and the oleander. It was yet too early for the hum of insect life,
      and the tricklings of the tiny fountains that sprinkled the flower-beds
      were the only sounds in the stillness. It was in color, outline, effect,
      and shadow, a scene such as only Italy can present, and Massy drank in all
      its influences with an eager delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were I a rich man," said he, "I would buy this paradise. What in all the
      splendor of man's invention can compare with the gorgeous glory of this
      flowery carpet? What frescoed ceiling could vie with these wide-leaved
      palms, interlaced with these twining acacias, glimpses of the blue sky
      breaking through? And for a mirror, there lies Nature's own,&mdash;the
      great blue ocean! What a life were it, to linger days and hours here, amid
      such objects of beauty, having one's thoughts ever upwards, and making in
      imagination a world of which these should be the types. The faintest
      fancies that could float across the mind in such an existence would be
      pleasures more real, more tangible, than ever were felt in the tamer life
      of the actual world."
    </p>
    <p>
      Loitering along, he at length came upon the little temple which served as
      a studio, on entering which, he found his own statue enshrined in the
      place of honor. Whether it was the frame of mind in which he chanced to
      be, or that place and light had some share in the result, for the first
      time the figure struck him as good, and he stood long gazing at his own
      work with the calm eye of a critic. At length, detecting, as he deemed,
      some defects in design, he drew nigh, and began to correct them. There are
      moments in which the mind attains the highest and clearest perception,&mdash;seasons
      in which, whatever the nature of the mental operation, the faculties
      address themselves readily to the task, and labor becomes less a toil than
      an actual pleasure. This was such. Massy worked on for hours; his
      conceptions grew rapidly under his hand into bold realities, and he saw
      that he was succeeding. It was not alone that he had imparted a more
      graceful and lighter beauty to his statue, but he felt within himself the
      promptings of a spirit that grew with each new suggestion of its own.
      Efforts that before had seemed above him he now essayed boldly;
      difficulties that once had appeared insurmountable he now encountered with
      courageous daring. Thus striving, he lost all sense of fatigue. Hunger and
      exhaustion were alike unremembered, and it was already late in the
      afternoon, as, overcome by continued toil, he threw himself heavily down,
      and sank off into a deep sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nigh sunset as he awoke. The distant bell of a monastery was
      ringing the hour of evening prayer, the solemn chime of the "Venti
      quattro," as he leaned on his arm and gazed in astonishment around him.
      The whole seemed like a dream. On every side were objects new and strange
      to, his eyes,&mdash;casts and models he had never seen before busts and
      statues and studies all unknown to him. At last his eyes rested on the
      Faun, and he remembered at once where he was. The languor of excessive
      fatigue, however, still oppressed him, and he was about to lie back again
      in sleep, when, bending gently over him, a young girl, with a low, soft
      accent, asked if he felt ill, or only tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massy gazed, without speaking, at features regular as the most classic
      model, and whose paleness almost gave them the calm beauty of the marble.
      His steady stare slightly colored her cheek, and made her voice falter a
      little as she repeated her question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I scarcely know," said he, sighing heavily. "I feel as though this were a
      dream, and I am afraid to awaken from it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me give you some wine," said she, bending down to hand him the glass;
      "you have over-fatigued yourself. The Faun is by your hand, is it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded a slow assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whence did you derive that knowledge of ancient art?" said she, eagerly.
      "Your figure has the light elasticity of the classic models, and yet
      nothing strained or exaggerated in attitude. Have you studied at Rome?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could do better now," said the youth, as, rising on his elbow, he
      strained his eyes to examine her. "I could achieve a real success."
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep flush covered her face at these words, so palpably alluding to
      herself, and she tried to repeat her question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said he, "I cannot say I have ever studied: all that I have done is
      full of faults; but I feel the spring of better things within me. Tell me,
      is this <i>your</i> home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said she, smiling faintly. "I live in the villa here with my aunt.
      She has purchased your statue, and wishes you to repair it, and then to
      engage in some other work for her. Let me assist you to rise; you seem
      very weak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>am</i> weak, and weary too," said he, staggering to a seat. "I have
      overworked myself, perhaps,&mdash;I scarcely know. Do not take away your
      hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are, then, the Sebastian Greppi of whom Carrara is so proud?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They call me Sebastian Greppi; but I never heard that my name was spoken
      of with any honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are unjust to your own fame. We have often heard of you. See, here
      are two models taken from your works. They have been my studies for many a
      day. I have often wished to see you, and ask if my attempt were rightly
      begun. Then here is a hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me model yours," said the youth, gazing steadfastly at the
      beautifully shaped one which rested on the chair beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come with me to the villa, and I will present you to my aunt; she will be
      pleased to know you. There, lean on my arm, for I see you are very weak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are you so kind, so good to me?" said he, faintly, while a tear rose
      slowly to his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      He arose totteringly, and, taking her arm, walked slowly along at her
      side. As they went, she spoke kindly and encouragingly to him, praised
      what she had seen of his works, and said how frequently she had wished to
      know him, and enjoy the benefit of his counsels in art. "For I, too," said
      she, laughing, "would be a sculptor."
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth stopped to gaze at her with a rapture he could not control. That
      one of such a station, surrounded by all the appliances of a luxurious
      existence, could devote herself to the toil and labor of art, implied an
      amount of devotion and energy that at once elevated her in his esteem. She
      blushed deeply at his continued stare, and turned at last away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, do not feel offended with me," cried he, passionately. "If you but
      knew how your words have relighted within me the dying-out embers of an
      almost exhausted ambition,&mdash;if you but knew how my heart has gained
      courage and hope,&mdash;how light and brightness have shone in upon me
      after hours and days of gloom! It was but yesterday I had resolved to
      abandon this career forever. I was bent on a new life, in a new world
      beyond the seas. These few things that a faithful companion of mine had
      charged himself to dispose of, were to supply the means of the journey;
      and now I think of it no more. I shall remain here to work hard and study,
      and try to achieve what may one day be called good. You will sometimes
      deign to see what I am doing, to tell me if my efforts are on the road to
      success, to give me hope when I am weak-hearted, and courage when I am
      faint. I know and feel," said he, proudly, "that I am not devoid of what
      accomplishes success, for I can toil and toil, and throw my whole soul
      into my work; but for this I need, at least, one who shall watch me with
      an eye of interest, glorying when I win, sorrowing when I am defeated.&mdash;Where
      are we? What palace is this?" cried he, as they crossed a spacious hall
      paved with porphyry and Sienna marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is my home," said the girl, "and this is its mistress."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as she spoke, she presented the youth to a lady, who, reclining on a
      sofa beside a window, gazed out towards the sea. She turned suddenly, and
      fixed her eyes on the stranger. With a wild start, she sprang up, and,
      staring eagerly at him, cried, "Who is this? Where does he come from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0003" id="linkimage-0003">
      <!-- IMG --></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/frontispiece.jpg" alt="Frontispiece " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      The young girl told his name and what he was; but the words did not fall
      on listening ears, and the lady sat like one spell-bound, with eyes
      riveted on the youth's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I like any one you have known, signora?" asked he, as he read the
      effect his presence had produced on her. "Do I recall some other
      features?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do," said she, reddening painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the memory is not of pleasure?" added the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Far, far from it; it is the saddest and cruelest of all my life,"
      muttered she, half to herself. "What part of Italy are you from? Your
      accent is Southern."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the accent of Naples, signora," said he, evading her question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your mother, was she Neapolitan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know little of my birth, signora. It is a theme I would not be
      questioned on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are a sculptor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The artist of the Faun, dearest aunt," broke in the girl, who watched
      with intense anxiety the changing expressions of the youth's features.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your voice even more than your features brings up the past," said the
      lady, as a deadly pallor spread over her own face, and her lips trembled
      as she spoke. "Will you not tell me something of your history?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you have told me the reason for which you ask it, perhaps I may,"
      said the youth, half sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there!" cried she, wildly, "in every tone, in every gesture, I
      trace this resemblance. Come nearer to me; let me see your hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are seamed and hardened with toil, lady," said the youth, as he
      showed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet they look as if there was a time when they did not know labor,"
      said she, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      An impatient gesture, as if he would not endure a continuance of this
      questioning, stopped her, and she said in a faint tone,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ask your pardon for all this. My excuse and my apology are that your
      features have recalled a time of sorrow more vividly than any words could.
      Your voice, too, strengthens the illusion. It may be a mere passing
      impression; I hope and pray it is. Come, Ida, come with me. Do not leave
      this, sir, till we speak with you again." So saying, she took her niece's
      arm and left the room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. NIGHT THOUGHTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was with a proud consciousness of having well fulfilled his mission
      that Billy Traynor once more bent his steps towards Massa. Besides
      providing himself with books of travel and maps of the regions they were
      about to visit, he had ransacked Genoa for weapons, and accoutrements, and
      horse-gear. Well knowing the youth's taste for the costly and the
      splendid, he had suffered himself to be seduced into the purchase of a
      gorgeously embroidered saddle mounting, and a rich bridle, in Mexican
      taste; a pair of splendidly mounted pistols, chased in gold and studded
      with large turquoises, with a Damascus sabre, the hilt of which was a
      miracle of fine workmanship, were also amongst his acquisitions; and poor
      Billy fed his imagination with the thought of all the delight these
      objects were certain to produce. In this way he never wearied admiring
      them; and a dozen times a day would he unpack them, just to gratify his
      mind by picturing the enjoyment they were to afford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How well you are lookin', my dear boy!" cried he, as he burst into the
      youth's room, and threw his arms around him; "'tis like ten years off my
      life to see you so fresh and so hearty. Is it the prospect of the glorious
      time before us that has given this new spring to your existence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More likely it is the pleasure I feel in seeing you back again," said
      Massy; and his cheek grew crimson as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis too good you are to me,&mdash;too good," said Billy, and his eyes
      ran over in tears, while he turned away his head to hide his emotion; "but
      sure it is part of yourself I do be growing every day I live. At first I
      could n't bear the thought of going away to live in exile, in a
      wilderness, as one may say; but now that I see your heart set upon it, and
      that your vigor and strength comes back just by the mere anticipation of
      it, I'm downright delighted with the plan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" said the youth, dreamily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure I am," resumed Billy; "and I do be thinking there 's a kind of
      poethry in carrying away into the solitary pine forest minds stored with
      classic lore, to be able to read one's Horace beside the gushing stream
      that flows on nameless and unknown, and con over ould Herodotus amidst
      adventures stranger than ever he told himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might be a happy life," said the other, slowly, almost moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, and it will be," said Billy, confidently. "Think of yourself, mounted
      on that saddle on a wild prairie horse, galloping free as the wind itself
      over the wide savannas, with a drove of rushing buffaloes in career before
      you, and so eager in pursuit that you won't stop to bring down the
      scarlet-winged bustard that swings on the branch above you. There they go,
      plungin' and snortin', the mad devils, with a force that would sweep a
      fortress before them; and here are we after them, makin' the dark woods
      echo again with our wild yells. That's what will warm up our blood, till
      we 'll not be afeard to meet an army of dragoons themselves. Them pistols
      once belonged to Cariatoké, a chief from Scio; and that blade&mdash;a real
      Damascus&mdash;was worn by an Aga of the Janissaries. Isn't it a picture?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth poised the sword in his hand, and laid it down without a word;
      while Billy continued to stare at him with an expression of intensest
      amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it that you don't care for it all now, that your mind is changed, and
      that you don't wish for the life we were talkin' over these three weeks?
      Say so at once, my own darlin', and here I am, ready and willin' never to
      think more of it. Only tell me what's passin' in your heart; I ask no
      more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I scarcely know it myself," said the youth. "I feel as though in a dream,
      and know not what is real and what fiction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How have you passed your time? What were you doin' while I was away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dreaming, I believe," said the other, with a sigh. "Some embers of my old
      ambition warmed up into a flame once more, and I fancied that there was
      that in me that by toil and labor might yet win upwards; and that, if so,
      this mere life of action would but bring repining and regret, and that I
      should feel as one who chose the meaner casket of fate, when both were
      within my reach."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you were at work again in the studio?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been finishing the arm of the Faun in that pavilion outside the
      town." A flush of crimson covered his face as he spoke, which Billy as
      quickly noticed, but misinterpreted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, and they praised you, I 'll be bound. They said it was the work of
      one whose genius would place him with the great ones of art, and that he
      who could do this while scarcely more than a boy, might, in riper years,
      be the great name of his century. Did they not tell you so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; not that, not that," said the other, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then they bade you go on, and strive and labor hard to develop into life
      the seeds of that glorious gift that was in you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor that," sighed the youth, heavily, while a faint spot of crimson
      burned on one cheek, and a feverish lustre lit up his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They did n't dispraise what you done, did they?" broke in Billy. "They
      could not, if they wanted to do it; but sure there's nobody would have the
      cruel heart to blight the ripenin' bud of genius,&mdash;to throw gloom
      over a spirit that has to struggle against its own misgivin's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wrong them, my dear friend; their words were all kindness and
      affection. They gave me hope, and encouragement too. They fancy that I
      have in me what will one day grow into fame itself; and even you, Billy,
      in your most sanguine hopes, have never dreamed of greater success for me
      than they have predicted in the calm of a moonlit saunter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May the saints in heaven reward them for it!" said Billy, and in his
      clasped hands and uplifted eyes was all the fervor of a prayer. "They have
      my best blessin' for their goodness," muttered he to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so I am again a sculptor!" said Massy, rising and walking the room.
      "Upon this career my whole heart and soul are henceforth to be
      concentrated; my fame, my happiness are to be those of the artist. From
      this day and this hour let every thought of what&mdash;not what I once
      was, but what I had hoped to be, be banished from my heart. I am Sebastian
      Greppi. Never let another name escape your lips to me. I will not, even
      for a second, turn from the path in which my own exertions are to win the
      goal. Let the faraway land of my infancy, its traditions, its
      associations, be but dreams for evermore. Forwards! forwards!" cried he,
      passionately; "not a glance, not a look, towards the past."
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy stared with admiration at the youth, over whose features a glow of
      enthusiasm was now diffused, and in broken, unconnected words spoke
      encouragement and good cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know well," said the youth, "how this same stubborn pride must be
      rooted out, how these false, deceitful visions of a stand and a station
      that I am never to attain must give place to nobler and higher
      aspirations; and you, my dearest friend, must aid me in all this,&mdash;unceasingly,
      unwearyingly reminding me that to myself alone must I look for anything;
      and that if I would have a country, a name, or a home, it is by the toil
      of this head and these hands they are to be won. My plan is this," said
      he, eagerly seizing the other's arm, and speaking with immense rapidity:
      "A life not alone of labor, but of the simplest; not a luxury, not an
      indulgence; our daily meals the humblest, our dress the commonest, nothing
      that to provide shall demand a moment's forethought or care; no wants that
      shall turn our thoughts from this great object, no care for the
      requirements that others need. Thus mastering small ambitions and petty
      desires, we shall concentrate all our faculties on our art; and even the
      humblest may thus outstrip those whose higher gifts reject such
      discipline."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 'll not live longer under the Duke's patronage, then?" said Traynor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not an hour. I return to that garden no more. There's a cottage on the
      mountain road to Serravezza will suit us well: it stands alone and on an
      eminence, with a view over the plain and the sea beyond. You can see it
      from the door,&mdash;there, to the left of the olive wood, lower down than
      the old ruin. We 'll live there, Billy, and we 'll make of that mean spot
      a hallowed one, where young enthusiasts in art will come, years hence,
      when we have passed away, to see the humble home Sebastian lived in,&mdash;to
      sit upon the grassy seat where he once sat, when dreaming of the mighty
      triumphs that have made him glorious." A wild burst of mocking laughter
      rung from the boy's lips as he said this; but its accents were less in
      derision of the boast than a species of hysterical ecstasy at the vision
      he had conjured up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why would n't it be so?" exclaimed Billy, ardently,&mdash;"why would
      n't you be great and illustrious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment of excitement was now over, and the youth stood pale, silent,
      and almost sickly in appearance; great drops of perspiration, too, stood
      on his forehead, and his quivering lips were bloodless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These visions are like meteor streaks," said he, falteringly; "they leave
      the sky blacker than they found it! But come along, let us to work, and we
      'll soon forget mere speculation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the life they now led each day exactly resembled the other. Rising
      early, the youth was in his studio at dawn; the faithful Billy, seated
      near, read for him while he worked. Watching, with a tact that only
      affection ever bestows, each changeful mood of the youth's mind, Traynor
      varied the topics with the varying humors of the other, and thus little of
      actual conversation took place between them, though their minds journeyed
      along together. To eke out subsistence, even humble as theirs, the young
      sculptor was obliged to make small busts and figures for sale, and Billy
      disposed of them at Lucca and Pisa, making short excursions to these
      cities as need required.
    </p>
    <p>
      The toil of the day over, they wandered out towards the seashore, taking
      the path which led through the olive road by the garden of the villa. At
      times the youth would steal away a moment from his companion, and enter
      the little park, with every avenue of which he was familiar; and although
      Billy noticed his absence, he strictly abstained from the slightest
      allusion to it. As he delayed longer and longer to return, Traynor
      maintained the same reserve, and thus there grew up gradually a secret
      between them,&mdash;a mystery that neither ventured to approach. With a
      delicacy that seemed an instinct in his humble nature, Billy would now and
      then feign occupation or fatigue to excuse himself from the evening
      stroll, and thus leave the youth free to wander as he wished; till at
      length it became a settled habit between them to separate at nightfall, to
      meet only on the morrow. These nights were spent in walking the garden
      around the villa, lingering stealthily amid the trees to watch the room
      where she was sitting, to catch a momentary glimpse of her figure as it
      passed the window, to hear perchance a few faint accents of her voice.
      Hours long would he so watch in the silent night, his whole soul steeped
      in a delicious dream wherein her image moved, and came and went, with
      every passing fancy. In the calm moonlight he would try to trace her
      footsteps in the gravel walk that led to the studio, and, lingering near
      them, whisper to her words of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, as he loitered thus, he thought he was perceived, for as he
      suddenly emerged from a dark alley into a broad space where the moonlight
      fell strongly, he saw a figure on a terrace above him, but without being
      able to recognize to whom it belonged. Timidly and fearfully he retired
      within the shade, and crept noiselessly away, shocked at the very thought
      of discovery. The next day he found a small bouquet of fresh flowers on
      the rustic seat beneath the window. At first he scarcely dared to touch
      it; but with a sudden flash of hope that it had been destined for himself,
      he pressed the flowers to his lips, and hid them in his bosom. Each night
      now the same present attracted him to the same place, and thus at once
      within his heart was lighted a flame of hope that illuminated all his
      being, making his whole life a glorious episode, and filling all the long
      hours of the day with thoughts of her who thus could think of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life has its triumphant moments, its dream of entrancing, ecstatic
      delight, when suocess has crowned a hard-fought struggle, or when the meed
      of other men's praise comes showered on us. The triumphs of heroism, of
      intellect, of noble endurance; the trials of temptation met and conquered;
      the glorious victory over self-interest,&mdash;are all great and ennobling
      sensations; but what are they all compared with the first consciousness of
      being loved, of being to another the ideal we have made of her? To this,
      nothing the world can give is equal. From the moment we have felt it, life
      changes around us. Its crosses are but barriers opposed to our strong
      will, that to assail and storm is a duty. Then comes a heroism in meeting
      the every-day troubles of existence, as though we were soldiers in a good
      and holy cause. No longer unseen or unmarked in the great ocean of life,
      we feel that there is an eye ever turned towards us, a heart ever
      throbbing with our own; that our triumphs are its triumphs,&mdash;our
      sorrows its sorrows. Apart from all the intercourse with the world, with
      its changeful good and evil, we feel that we have a treasure that dangers
      cannot approach; we know that in our heart of hearts a blessed mystery is
      locked up,&mdash;a well of pure thoughts that can calm down the most
      fevered hour of life's anxieties. So the youth felt, and, feeling so, was
      happy.

      CHAPTER XXXIV. A MINISTER'S LETTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      British Legation, Naples,
    </p>
    <p>
      Nov&mdash;, 18&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Harcourt,&mdash;Not mine the fault that your letter has lain six
      weeks unanswered; but having given up penwork myself for the last eight
      months, and Crawley, my private sec., being ill, the delay was
      unavoidable. The present communication you owe to the fortunate arrival
      here of Captain Mellish, who has kindly volunteered to be my amanuensis. I
      am indeed sorely grieved at this delay. I shall be <i>désolé</i> if it
      occasion you anything beyond inconvenience. How a private sec. should
      permit himself the luxury of an attack of influenza I cannot conceive. We
      shall hear of one's hairdresser having the impertinence to catch cold,
      to-morrow or next day!
    </p>
    <p>
      If I don't mistake, it was you yourself recommended Crawley to me, and I
      am only half grateful for the service. He is a man of small prejudices;
      fancies that he ought to have a regular hour for dinner; thinks that he
      should have acquaintances; and will persist in imagining himself an
      existent something, appertaining to the Legation,&mdash;while, in reality,
      he is only a shadowy excrescence of my own indolent habits, the recipient
      of the trashy superfluities one commits to paper and calls despatches.
      Latterly, in my increasing laziness, I have used him for more intimate
      correspondence; and, as Doctor Allitore has now denied me all manual
      exertion whatever, I am actually wholly dependent on such aid. I'm sure I
      long for the discovery of some other mode of transmitting one's
      brain-efforts than by the slow process of manuscript,&mdash;some
      photographic process that, by a series of bright pictures, might display
      <i>en tableau</i> what one is now reduced to accomplish by narrative. As
      it ever did and ever will happen too, they have deluged me with work when
      I crave rest. Every session of Parliament must have its blue-book; and by
      the devil's luck they have decided that Italy is to furnish the present
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have always been a soldier, and whenever your inspecting general came
      his round, your whole care has been to make the troop horses look as fat,
      the men's whiskers as trim, their overalls as clean, and their curb-chains
      as bright, as possible. You never imagined or dreamed of a contingency
      when it would be desirable that the animals should be all sorebacked, the
      whole regiment under stoppages, and the trumpeter in a quinsy. Had you
      been a diplomatist instead of a dragoon, this view of things might,
      perhaps, have presented itself, and the chief object of your desire have
      been to show that the system under which you functionated worked as ill as
      need be; that the court to which you were accredited abhorred you; its
      Ministers snubbed, its small officials slighted you; that all your
      communications were ill received, your counsels ill taken; that what you
      reprobated was adopted, what you advised rejected; in fact, that the only
      result of your presence was the maintenance of a perpetual ill-will and
      bad feeling; and that without the aid of a line-of-battle ship, or at
      least a frigate, your position was no longer tenable. From the moment, my
      dear H&mdash;&mdash;, that you can establish this fact, you start into
      life as an able and active Minister, imbued with thoroughly British
      principles&mdash;an active asserter of what is due to his country's rights
      and dignity, not truckling to court favor, or tamely submitting to royal
      impertinences; not like the noble lord at this place, or the more
      subservient viscount at that, but, in plain words, an admirable public
      servant, whose reward, whatever courts and cabinets may do, will always be
      willingly accorded by a grateful nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am afraid this sketch of a special envoy's career will scarcely tempt
      you to exchange for a mission abroad! And you are quite right, my dear
      friend. It is a very unrewarding profession. I often wish myself that I
      had taken something in the colonies, or gone into the Church, or some
      other career which had given me time and opportunity to look after my
      health,&mdash;of which, by the way, I have but an indifferent account to
      render you. These people here can't hit it off at all, Harcourt; they keep
      muddling away about indigestion, deranged functions, and the rest of it.
      The mischief is in the blood,&mdash;I mean, in the undue distribution of
      the blood. So Treysenac, the man of Bagnères, proved to me. There is a
      flux and reflux in us, as in the tides, and when, from deficient energy or
      lax muscular power, that ceases, we are all driven by artificial means to
      remedy the defect. Treysenac's theory is position. By a number of
      ingeniously contrived positions he accomplishes an artificial congestion
      of any part he pleases; and in his establishment at Bagnères you may see
      some fifty people strung up by the arms and legs, by the waists or the
      ankles, in the most marvellous manner, and with truly fabulous success. I
      myself passed three mornings suspended by the middle, like the sheep in
      the decoration of the Golden Fleece, and was amazed at the strange
      sensations I experienced before I was cut down.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know the obstinacy with which the medical people reject every
      discovery in the art, and only sanction its employment when the world has
      decreed in its favor. You will, therefore, not be surprised to hear that
      Larrey and Cooper, to whom I wrote about Treysenac's theory, sent me very
      unsatisfactory, indeed very unseemly, replies. I have resolved, however,
      not to let the thing drop, and am determined to originate a Suspensorium
      in England, when I can chance upon a man of intelligence and scientific
      knowledge to conduct it. Like mesmerism, the system has its antipathies;
      and thus yesterday Crawley fainted twice after a few minutes' suspension
      by the arms. But he is a bigot about anything he hears for the first time,
      and I was not sorry at his punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish you would talk over this matter with any clever medical man in your
      neighborhood, and let me hear the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so you are surprised, you say, how little influence English
      representations exercise over the determinations of foreign cabinets. I go
      farther, and confess no astonishment at all at the no-influence! My dear
      dragoon, have you not, some hundred and fifty times in this life, endured
      a small martyrdom in seeing a very indifferent rider torment almost to
      madness the animal he bestrode, just by sheer ignorance and awkwardness,&mdash;now
      worrying the flank with incautious heel, now irritating the soft side of
      the mouth with incessant jerkings; always counteracting the good impulses,
      ever prompting the bad ones of his beast? And have you not, while heartily
      wishing yourself in the saddle, felt the utter inutility of administering
      any counsels to the rider? You saw, and rightly saw, that even if he
      attempted to follow your suggestions, he would do so awkwardly and
      inaptly, acting at wrong moments and without that continuity of purpose
      which must ever accompany an act of address; and that for his safety, and
      even for the welfare of the animal, it were as well they should jog on
      together as they had done, trusting that after a time they might establish
      a sort of compromise, endurable, if not beneficial, to both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, my dear friend, in brief, is the state of many of those foreign
      governments to whom we are so profuse of our wise counsels. It were
      doubtless much better if they ruled well; but let us see if the road to
      this knotty consummation be by the adoption of methods totally new to
      them, estranged from all their instincts and habits, and full of perils
      which their very fears will exaggerate. Constitutional governments, like
      underdone roast beef, suit our natures and our latitude; but they would
      seem lamentable experiments when tried south of the Alps. Liberty with us
      means the right to break heads at a county election, and to print
      impertinences in newspapers. With the Spaniard or the Italian it would be
      to carry a poniard more openly, and use it more frequently than at
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all events, if it be any satisfaction to you, you may be assured that
      the rulers in all these cases are not much better off than those they rule
      over. They lead lives of incessant terror, distrust, and anxiety. Their
      existence is poisoned by ceaseless fears of treachery,&mdash;they know not
      where. They change ministers as travellers change the direction of their
      journey, to disconcert the supposed plans of their enemies; and they
      vacillate between cruelty and mercy, really not knowing in which lies
      their safety. Don't fancy that they have any innate pleasure in harsh
      measures. The likelihood is, they hate them as much as you do yourself;
      but they know no other system; and, to come back to my cavalry
      illustration, the only time they tried a snaffle, they were run away with.
    </p>
    <p>
      I trust these prosings will be a warning to you how you touch upon
      politics again in a letter to me; but I really did not wish to-be a bore,
      and now here I am, ready to answer, as far as in me lies, all your
      interrogatories; first premising that I am not at liberty to enter upon
      the question of Glencore himself, and for the simple reason that he has
      made me his confidant. And now, as to the boy, I could make nothing of
      him, Harcourt; and for this reason,&mdash;he had not what sailors call
      "steerage way" on him. He went wherever you bade, but without an impulse.
      I tried to make him care for his career; for the gay world; for the
      butterfly life of young diplomacy; for certain dissipations,&mdash;excellent
      things occasionally to develop nascent faculties. I endeavored to interest
      him by literary society and savans, but unsuccessfully. For art indeed he
      showed some disposition, and modelled prettily; but it never rose above
      "amateurship." Now, enthusiasm, although a very excellent ingredient, will
      no more make an artist than a brisk kitchen fire will provide a dinner
      where all the materials are wanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to despair of him, Harcourt, when I saw that there were no
      features about him. He could do everything reasonably well, because there
      was no hope of his doing anything with real excellence. He wandered away
      from me to Carrara, with his quaint companion the Doctor; and after some
      months wrote me rather a sturdy letter, rejecting all moneyed advances,
      past and future, and saying something very haughty, and of course very
      stupid, about the "glorious sense of independence." I replied, but he
      never answered me; and here might have ended all my knowledge of his
      history, had not a letter, of which I send you an extract, resumed the
      narrative. The writer is the Princess Sabloukoff, a lady of whose
      attractions and fascinations you have often heard me speak. When you have
      read, and thought over the enclosed, let me have your opinion. I do not, I
      cannot, believe in the rumor you allude to. Glencore is not the man to
      marry at his time of life, and in his circumstances. Send me, however, all
      the particulars you are in possession of. I hope they don't mean to send
      you to India, because you seem to dislike it. For my own part, I suspect I
      should enjoy that country immensely. Heat is the first element of daily
      comfort, and all the appliances to moderate it are <i>ex-officio</i>
      luxuries; besides that in India there is a splendid and enlarged
      selfishness in the mode of life very different from the petty egotisms of
      our rude Northland.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do go, pray take Naples in the way. The route by Alexandria and
      Suez, they all tell me, is the best and most expeditious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mellish desires me to add his remembrances, hoping you have not forgotten
      him. He served in the "Fifth" with you in Canada,&mdash;that is, if you be
      the same George Harcourt who played Tony Lumpkin so execrably at Montreal.
      I have told him it is probable, and am yours ever,

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. HARCOURT'S LODGINGS
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Harcourt had finished the reading of that letter we have presented in
      our last chapter, he naturally turned for information on the subject which
      principally interested him to the enclosure. It was a somewhat bulky
      packet, and, from its size, at once promised very full and ample details.
      As he opened it, however, he discovered it was in various handwritings;
      but his surprise was further increased by the following heading, in large
      letters, in the top of a page: "Sulphur Question," and beginning, "My
      Lord, by a reference to my despatch, No. 478, you will perceive that the
      difficulties which the Neapolitan Government&mdash;" Harcourt turned over
      the page. It was all in the same strain. Tariffs, treaties, dues, and
      duties occurred in every line. Three other documents of like nature
      accompanied this; after which came a very ill-written scrawl on coarse
      paper, entitled, "Hints as to diet and daily exercise for his Excellency's
      use."
    </p>
    <p>
      The honest Colonel, who was not the quickest of men, was some time before
      he succeeded in unravelling to his satisfaction the mystery before him,
      and recognizing that the papers on his table had been destined for a
      different address, while the letter of the Princess had, in all
      probability, been despatched to the Foreign Office, and was now either
      confounding or amusing the authorities in Downing Street. While Harcourt
      laughed over the blunder, he derived no small gratification from thinking
      that nothing but great geniuses ever fell into these mistakes, and was
      about to write off in this very spirit to Upton, when he suddenly
      bethought him that, before an answer could arrive, he himself would be far
      away on his journey to India.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I asked nothing," said he, "that could be difficult to reply to. It was
      plain enough, too, that I only wanted such information as he could have
      given me off-hand. If I could but assure Glencore that the boy was worthy
      of him,&mdash;that there was stuff to give good promise of future
      excellence, that he was honorable and manly in all his dealings,&mdash;who
      knows what effect such assurance might have had? There are days when it
      strikes me Glencore would give half his fortune to have the youth beside
      him, and be able to call him his own. Why he cannot, does not do it, is a
      mystery which I am unable to fathom. He never gave me his confidence on
      this head; indeed, he gave me something like a rebuff one evening, when he
      erroneously fancied that I wanted to probe the mysterious secret. It shows
      how much he knows of my nature," added he, laughing. "Why, I'd rather
      carry a man's trunk or his portmanteau on my back than his family secrets
      in my heart. I could rest and lay down my burden in the one case,&mdash;in
      the other, there's never a moment of repose! And now Glencore is to be
      here this very day&mdash;the ninth&mdash;to learn my news. The poor fellow
      comes up from Wales, just to talk over these matters, and I have nothing
      to offer him but this blundering epistle. Ay, here 's the letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Harcourt,&mdash;Let me have a mutton-chop with you on the ninth, and
      give me, if you can, the evening after it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glencore."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man must be ill off for counsel and advice when he thinks of such aid
      as mine. Heaven knows, I never was such a brilliant manager of my own
      fortunes that any one should trust his destinies in my hands. Well, he
      shall have the mutton-chop, and a good glass of old port after it; and the
      evening, or, if he likes it, the night shall be at his disposal." And with
      this resolve, Harcourt, having given orders for dinner at six, issued
      forth to stroll down to his club, and drop in at the Horse Guards, and
      learn as much as he could of the passing events of the day,&mdash;meaning,
      thereby, the details of whatever regarded the army-list, and those who
      walk in scarlet attire.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about five o'clock of a dreary November afternoon that a
      hackney-coach drew op at Harcourt's lodgings in Dover Street, and a tall
      and very sickly looking man, carrying his carpet-bag in one hand and a
      dressing-case in the other, descended and entered the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Massy, sir?" said the Colonel's servant, as he ushered him in; for
      such was the name Glencore desired to be known by. And the stranger
      nodded, and throwing himself wearily down on a sofa, seemed overcome with
      fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is your master out?" asked he, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; but I expect him immediately. Dinner was ordered for six, and
      he 'll be back to dress half an hour before that time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dinner for two?" half impatiently asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, for two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And all visitors in the evening denied admittance? Did your master say
      so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; out for every one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore now covered his face with his hands, and relapsed into silence.
      At length he lifted his eyes till they fell upon a colored drawing over
      the chimney. It was an officer in hussar uniform, mounted on a splendid
      charger, and seated with all the graceful ease of a consummate horseman.
      This much alone he could perceive from where he lay, and indolently
      raising himself on one arm, he asked if it were "a portrait of his
      master"?
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir; of my master's colonel, Lord Glencore, when he commanded the
      Eighth, and was said to be the handsomest man in the service."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Show it to me!" cried he, eagerly, and almost snatched the drawing from
      the other's hands. He gazed at it intently and fixedly, and his sallow
      cheek once reddened slightly as he continued to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That never was a likeness!" said he, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My master thinks it a wonderful resemblance, sir,&mdash;not of what he is
      now, of course; but that was taken fifteen years ago or more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is he so changed since that?" asked the sick man, plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I hear, sir. He had a stroke of some kind, or fit of one sort or
      another, brought on by fretting. They took away his title, I'm told. They
      made out that he had no right to it, that he wasn't the real lord. But
      here's the Colonel, sir;" and almost as he spoke, Harcourt's step was on
      the stair. The next moment his hand was cordially clasped in that of his
      guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I scarcely expected you before six; and how have you borne the journey?"
      cried he, taking a seat beside the sofa. A gentle motion of the eyebrows
      gave the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, you'll be all right after the soup. Marcom, serve the dinner
      at once. I'll not dress. And mind, no admittance to any one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have heard from Upton?" asked Glencore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And satisfactorily?" asked he, more anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so; but you shall know all by and by. I have got mackerel for you.
      It was a favorite dish of yours long ago, and you shall taste such mutton
      as your Welsh mountains can't equal. I got the haunch from the Ardennes a
      week ago, and kept it for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I deserved such generous fare; but I have only an invalid's
      stomach," said Glencore, smiling faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall be reported well, and fit for duty to-day, or my name is not
      George Harcourt. The strongest and toughest fellow that ever lived could
      n't stand up against the united effects of low diet and low spirits. To
      act generously and think generously, you must live generously, take plenty
      of exercise, breathe fresh air, and know what it is to be downright weary
      when you go to bed,&mdash;not bored, mark you, for that's another thing.
      Now, here comes the soup, and you shall tell me whether turtle be not the
      best restorative a man ever took after twelve hours of the road."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether tempted by the fare, or anxious to gratify the hospitable wishes
      of his host, Glencore ate heartily, and drank what for his abstemious
      habit was freely, and, so far as a more genial air and a more ready smile
      went, fully justified Harcourt's anticipations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove! you 're more like yourself than I have seen you this many a
      day," said the Colonel, as they drew their chairs towards the fire, and
      sat with that now banished, but ever to be regretted, little spider-table,
      that once emblematized after-dinner blessedness, between them. "This
      reminds one of long ago, Glencore, and I don't see why we cannot bring to
      the hour some of the cheerfulness that we once boasted."
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint, very faint smile, with more of sorrow than joy in it, was the
      other's only reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at the thing this way, Glencore," said Harcourt, eagerly. "So long
      as a man has, either by his fortune or by his personal qualities, the
      means of benefiting others, there is a downright selfishness in shutting
      himself up in his sorrow, and saying to the world, 'My own griefs are
      enough for me; I 'll take no care or share in yours.' Now, there never was
      a fellow with less of this selfishness than you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not speak to me of what I was, my dear friend. There's not a plank of
      the old craft remaining. The name alone lingers, and even that will soon
      be extinct."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, then, you still hold to this stern resolution? Shall I tell you what
      I think of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you had better not do so," said Glencore, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove! then, I will, just for that menace," said Harcourt. "I said,
      'This is vengeance on Glencore's part.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To whom, sir, did you make this remark?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To myself, of course. I never alluded to the matter to any other; never."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So far, well," said Glencore, solemnly; "for had you done so, we had
      never exchanged words again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear fellow," said Harcourt, laying his hand affectionately on the
      other's, "I can well imagine the price a sensitive nature like yours must
      pay for the friendship of one so little gifted with tact as I am. But
      remember always that there's this advantage in the intercourse: you can
      afford to hear and bear things from a man of <i>my</i> stamp, that would
      be outrages from perhaps the lips of a brother. As Upton, in one of his
      bland moments, once said to me, 'Fellows like you, Harcourt, are the
      bitters of the human pharmacopoeia,&mdash;somewhat hard to take, but very
      wholesome when you're once swallowed.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are the best of the triad, and no great praise that, either,"
      muttered Glencore to himself. After a pause, he continued: "It has not
      been from any distrust in your friendship, Harcourt, that I have not
      spoken to you before on this gloomy subject. I know well that you bear me
      more affection than any one of all those who call themselves my friends;
      but when a man is about to do that which never can meet approval from
      those who love him, he seeks no counsel, he invites no confidence. Like
      the gambler, who risks all on a single throw, he makes his venture from
      the impulse of a secret mysterious prompting within, that whispers, 'With
      this you are rescued or ruined!' Advice, counsel!" cried he, in bitter
      mockery, "tell me, when have such ever alleviated the tortures of a
      painful malady? Have you ever heard that the writhings of the sick man
      were calmed by the honeyed words of his friends at the bedside? I"&mdash;here
      his voice became full and loud&mdash;"I was burdened with a load too great
      for me to bear. It had bowed me to the earth, and all but crushed me! The
      sense of an unaccomplished vengeance was like a debt which, unrequited ere
      I died, sent me to my grave dishonored. Which of you all could tell me how
      to endure this? What shape could your philosophy assume?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I guessed aright," broke in Harcourt. "This was done in vengeance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no reckoning to render you, sir," said Glencore, haughtily; "for
      any confidence of mine, you are more indebted to my passion than to my
      inclination. I came up here to speak and confer with you about this boy,
      whose guardianship you are unable to continue longer. Let us speak of
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Harcourt, in his habitual tone of easy good humor, "they are
      going to send me out to India again. I have had eighteen years of it
      already; but I have no Parliamentary influence, nor could I trace a
      fortieth cousinship with the House of Lords; but, after all, it might be
      worse. Now, as to this lad, what if I were to take him out with me? This
      artist life that he seems to have adopted scarcely promises much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me see Upton's letter," said Glencore, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There it is. But I must warn you that the really important part is
      wanting; for instead of sending us, as he promised, the communication of
      his Russian Princess, he has stuffed in a mass of papers intended for
      Downing Street, and a lot of doctor's prescriptions, for whose loss he is
      doubtless suffering martyrdom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this credible?" cried Glencore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There they are, very eloquent about sulphur, and certain refugees with
      long names, and with some curious hints about Spanish flies and the
      flesh-brush."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore flung down the papers in indignation, and walked up and down the
      room without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd wager a trifle," cried Harcourt, "that Madame&mdash;What
      's-her-name's letter has gone to the Foreign Office in lien of the
      despatches; and, if so, they have certainly gained most by the whole
      transaction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have scarcely considered, perhaps, what publicity may thus be given
      to my private affairs," said Glencore. "Who knows what this woman may have
      said; what allusions her letter may contain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true; I never did think of that," muttered Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who knows what circumstances of my private history are now bandied about
      from desk to desk by flippant fools, to be disseminated afterwards over
      Europe by every courier?" cried he, with increasing passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Harcourt could reply, the servant entered, and whispered a few
      words in his ear. "But you already denied me," said Harcourt. "You told
      him that I was from home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; but he said that his business was so important that he 'd wait
      for your return, if I could not say where he might find you. This is his
      card."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harcourt took it, and read, "Major Scaresby, from Naples." "What think
      you, Glencore? Ought we to admit this gentleman? It may be that this visit
      relates to what we have been speaking about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scaresby&mdash;Scaresby&mdash;I know the name," muttered Glencore. "To be
      sure! There was a fellow that hung about Florence and Rome long ago, and
      called himself Scaresby; an ill-tongued old scandal-monger people
      encouraged in a land where newspapers are not permitted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He affects to have something very pressing to communicate. Perhaps it
      were better to have him up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't make me known to him, then, or let me have to talk to him," said
      Glencore, throwing himself down on a sofa; "and let his visit be as brief
      as you can manage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harcourt made a significant sign to his servant, and the moment after the
      Major was heard ascending the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very persistent of me, you'll say, Colonel Harcourt. Devilish tenacious
      of my intentions, to force myself thus upon you!" said the Major, as he
      bustled into the room, with a white leather bag in his hand; "but I
      promised Upton I'd not lie down on a bed till I saw you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the apologies should come from my side, Major," said Harcourt, as he
      handed him to a chair; "but the fact was, that having an invalid friend
      with me, quite incapable of seeing company, and having matters of some
      importance to discuss with him&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so," broke in Scaresby; "and if it were not that I had given a very
      strong pledge to Upton, I 'd have given my message to your servant, and
      gone off to my hotel. But he laid great stress on my seeing you, and
      obtaining certain papers which, if I understand aright, have reached you
      in mistake, being meant for the Minister at Downing Street. Here's his own
      note, however, which will explain all."
    </p>
    <p>
      It ran thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,&mdash;So I find that some of the despatches
      have got into your enclosure instead of that "on his Majesty's service." I
      therefore send off the insupportable old bore who will deliver this, to
      rescue them, and convey them to their fitting destination. "The
      extraordinaries" will be burdened to some fifty or sixty pounds for it;
      but they very rarely are expended so profitably as in getting rid of an
      intolerable nuisance. Give him all the things, therefore, and pack him off
      to Downing Street. I'm far more uneasy, however, about some prescriptions
      which I suspect are along with them. One, a lotion for the cervical
      vertebrae, of invaluable activity, which you may take a copy of, but
      strictly, on honor, for your own use only. Scaresby will obtain the
      Princess's letter, and hand it to you. It is certain not to have been
      opened at F. O., as they never read anything not alluded to in the private
      correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This blunder has done me a deal of harm. My nerves are not in a state to
      stand such shocks; and though, in fact, you are not the culpable party, I
      cannot entirely acquit you for having in part occasioned it. [Harcourt
      laughed good-humoredly at this, and continued:] If you care for it, old S.
      will give you all the last gossip from these parts, and be the channel of
      yours to me. But don't dine him; he's not worth a dinner. He 'll only
      repay sherry and soda-water, and one of those execrable cheroots you used
      to be famed for. Amongst the recipes, let me recommend you an admirable
      tonic, the principal ingredient in which is the oil of the star-fish. It
      will probably produce nausea, vertigo, and even fainting for a week or
      two, but these symptoms decline at last, and, except violent hiccup, no
      other inconvenience remains. Try it, at all events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours ever, H. U.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Harcourt perused this short epistle, Scaresby, on the invitation of
      his host, had helped himself freely to the Madeira, and a plate of
      devilled biscuits beside it, giving, from time to time, oblique glances
      towards the dark corner of the room, where Glencore lay, apparently
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope Upton's letter justifies my insistence, Colonel. He certainly gave
      me to understand that the case was a pressing one," said Scaresby.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so, Major Scaresby; and I have only to reiterate my excuses for
      having denied myself to you. But you are aware of the reason;" and he
      glanced towards where Glen-Core was lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very excellent fellow, Upton," said the Major, sipping his wine, "but
      very&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;eccentric; very odd; not like any
      one else, you know, in the way he does things. I happened to be one of his
      guests t'other day. He had detained us above an hour waiting dinner, when
      he came in all flurried and excited, and, turning to me, said, 'Scaresby,
      have you any objection to a trip to England at his Majesty's expense?' and
      as I replied, 'None whatever; indeed, it would suit my book to perfection
      just now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, then,' said he, 'get your traps together, and be here within an
      hour. I 'll have all in readiness for you.' I did not much fancy starting
      off in this fashion, and without my dinner, too; but egad! he's one of
      those fellows that don't stand parleying, and so I just took him at his
      word, and here I am. I take it the matter must be a very emergent one,
      eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is clear Sir Horace Upton thought so," said Harcourt, rather amused
      than offended by the other's curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a woman in it, somehow, I 'll be bound, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harcourt laughed heartily at this sally, and pushed the decanter towards
      his guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that I'd give sixpence to know every syllable of the whole
      transaction," said Scaresby. "A man that has passed, as I have, the last
      twenty-five years of his life between Rome, Florence, and Naples, has
      devilish little to learn of what the world calls scandal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you must indeed possess a wide experience," said Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a man in Europe, sir, could tell you as many dark passages of good
      society! I kept a kind of book once,&mdash;a record of fashionable
      delinquencies; but I had to give it up. It took me half my day to
      chronicle even the passing events; and then my memory grew so retentive by
      practice, I did n't want the reference, but could give you date, and name,
      and place for every incident that has scandalized the world for the last
      quarter of the century."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you still possess this wonderful gift, Major?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty well; not, perhaps, to the same extent I once did. You see,
      Colonel Harcourt,"&mdash;here his voice became low and confidential,&mdash;"some
      twenty, or indeed fifteen years back, it was only persons of actual
      condition that permitted themselves the liberty to do these things; but,
      hang it, sir! now you have your middle-class folk as profligate as their
      betters. Jones, or Smith, or Thompson runs away with his neighbor's wife,
      cheats at cards, and forges his friend's name, just as if he had the best
      blood in his veins, and fourteen quarterings on his escutcheon. What
      memory, then, I ask you, could retain all the shortcomings of these
      people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I 'd really not trouble my head with such ignoble delinquents," said
      Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor do I, sir, save when, as will sometimes happen, they have a footing,
      with one leg at least, in good society. For, in the present state of the
      world, a woman with a pretty face, and a man with a knowledge of
      horseflesh, may move in any circle they please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a severe censor of the age we live in, I see," said Harcourt,
      smiling. "At the same time, the offences could scarcely give you much
      uneasiness, or you 'd not take up your residence where they most abound."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you want to destroy tigers, you must frequent the jungle," said
      Scaresby, with one of his heartiest laughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, rather, if you have the vulture's appetite, you must go where there
      is carrion!" cried Glencore, with a voice to which passion lent a savage
      vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh? ha! very good! devilish smart of your sick friend. Pray present me to
      him," said Scaresby, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, never mind him," whispered Harcourt, pressing him down into his
      seat. "At some other time, perhaps. He is nervous and irritable.
      Conversation fatigues him, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Egad! that was neatly said, though; I hope I shall not forget it. One
      envies these sick fellows, sometimes, the venom they get from bad health.
      But I am forgetting myself in the pleasure of your society," added he,
      rising from the table, as he finished off the last glass in the decanter.
      "I shall call at Downing Street to-morrow for that letter of Upton's, and,
      with your permission, will deposit it in your hands afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harcourt accompanied him to the door with thanks. Profuse, indeed, was he
      in his recognitions, desiring to get him clear off the ground before any
      further allusions on his part, or rejoinders from Glencore, might involve
      them all in new complications.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that fellow well," cried Glencore, almost ere the door closed on
      him. "He is just what I remember him some twenty years ago. Dressed up in
      the cast-off vices of his betters, he has passed for a man of fashion
      amongst his own set, while he is regarded as a wit by those who mistake
      malevolence for humor. I ask no other test of a society than that such a
      man is endured in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sometimes suspect," said Harcourt, "that the world never believes these
      fellows to be as ill-natured as then-tongues bespeak them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are wrong, George; the world knows them well. The estimation they are
      held in is, for the reflective flattery by which each listener to their
      sarcasms soothes his own conscience as he says, 'I could be just as
      bitter, if I consented to be as bad.'''
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot at all account for Upton's endurance of such a man," said
      Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As there are men who fancy that they strengthen their animal system by
      braving every extreme of climate, so Upton imagines that he invigorates
      his <i>morale</i> by associating with all kinds and descriptions of
      people; and there is no doubt that in doing so he extends the sphere of
      his knowledge of mankind. After all," muttered he, with a sigh, "it 's
      only learning the geography of a land too unhealthy to live in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore arose as he said this, and, with a nod of leave-taking, retired
      to his room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI. A FEVERED MIND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Harcourt passed the morning of the following day in watching the street
      for Scaresby's arrival. Glencore's impatience had grown into absolute
      fever to obtain the missing letter, and he kept asking every moment at
      what hour he had promised to be there, and wondering at his delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noon passed over,&mdash;one o'clock; it was now nearly half-past, as a
      carriage drove hastily to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At last," cried Glencore, with a deep sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Gilbert Bruce, sir, requests to know if you can receive him," said
      the servant to Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another disappointment!" muttered Glencore, as he left the room, when
      Harcourt motioned to the servant to introduce the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Colonel Harcourt," cried the other, entering, "excuse a very
      abrupt call; but I have a most pressing need of your assistance. I hear
      you can inform me of Lord Glencore's address."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is residing in North Wales at present. I can give you his post town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but can I be certain that he will admit me if I should go down
      there? He is living, I hear, in strict retirement, and I am anxious for a
      personal interview."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot insure you that," said Harcourt. "He does live, as you have
      heard, entirely estranged from all society. But if you write to him&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! there's the difficulty. A letter and its reply takes some days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is the matter, then, so very imminent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is so; at least it is thought to be so by an authority that neither
      you nor I will be likely to dispute. You know his Lordship intimately, I
      fancy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps. I may call myself as much his friend as any man living."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, I may confide to you my business with him. It happened that,
      a few days back, Lord Adderley was on a visit with the King at Brighton,
      when a foreign messenger arrived with despatches. They were, of course,
      forwarded to him there; and as the King has a passion for that species of
      literature, he opened them all himself. Now, I suspect that his Majesty
      cares more for the amusing incidents which occasionally diversify the life
      of foreign courts than for the great events of politics. At all events, he
      devours them with avidity, and seems conversant with the characters and
      private affairs of some hundreds of people he has never seen, nor in all
      likelihood will ever see! In turning over the loose pages of one of the
      despatches from Naples, I think, he came upon what appeared to be a
      fragment of a letter. Of what it was, or what it contained, I have not the
      slightest knowledge. Adderley himself has not seen it, nor any one but the
      King. All I know is that it concerns in some way Lord Glencore; for
      immediately on reading it he gave me instructions to find him out, and
      send him down to Brighton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid, were you to see Glencore, your mission would prove a
      failure. He has given up the world altogether, and even a royal command
      would scarcely withdraw him from his retirement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events, I must make the trial. You can let me have his address,
      and perhaps you would do more, and give me some sort of introduction to
      him,&mdash;something that might smooth down the difficulty of a first
      visit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harcourt was silent, and stood for some seconds in deep thought; which the
      other, mistaking for a sign of unwillingness to comply with his request,
      quickly added, "If my demand occasion you any inconvenience, or if there
      be the slightest difficulty&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, nay, I was not thinking of that," said Harcourt. "Pray excuse me for
      a moment. I will fetch you the address you spoke of;" and without waiting
      for more, he left the room. The next minute he was in Glencore's room,
      hurriedly narrating to him all that had passed, and asking him what course
      he should pursue. Glencore heard the story with a greater calm than
      Harcourt dared to hope for; and seemed pleased at the reiterated assurance
      that the King alone had seen the letter referred to; and when Harcourt
      abruptly asked what was to be done, he slowly replied, "I must obey his
      Majesty's commands. I must go to Brighton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But are you equal to all this? Have you strength for it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so; at all events, I am determined to make the effort. I was a
      favorite with his Majesty long ago. He will say nothing to hurt me
      needlessly; nor is it in his nature to do so. Tell Bruce that you will
      arrange everything, and that I shall present myself to-morrow at the
      palace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember, Glencore, that if you say so&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must be sure and keep my word. Well, so I mean, George. I was a
      courtier once upon a time, and have not outlived my deference to a
      sovereign. I 'll be there; you may answer for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment that Glencore had come to this resolve, a complete change
      seemed to pass over the nature of the man. It was as though a new spring
      had been given to his existence. The reformation that all the
      blandishments of friendship, all the soft influences of kindness, could
      never accomplish, was more than half effected by the mere thought of an
      interview with a king, and the possible chance of a little royal sympathy!
    </p>
    <p>
      If Harcourt was astonished, he was not the less pleased at all this. He
      encouraged Glencore's sense of gratification by every means in his power,
      and gladly lent himself to all the petty anxieties about dress and
      appearance in which he seemed now immersed. Nothing could exceed, indeed,
      the care he bestowed on these small details; ever insisting as he did
      that, his Majesty being the best-dressed gentleman in Europe, these
      matters assumed a greater importance in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must try to recover somewhat of my former self," said he. "There was a
      time when I came and went freely to Carlton House, when I was somewhat
      more than a mere frequenter of the Prince's society. They tell me that of
      late he is glad to see any of those who partook of his intimacy of those
      times; who can remember the genial spirits who made his table the most
      brilliant circle of the world; who can talk to him of Hanger, and Kelly,
      and Sheridan, and the rest of them. I spent my days and nights with them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Warming with the recollection of a period which, dissolute and dissipated
      as it was, yet redeemed by its brilliancy many of its least valuable
      features, Glencore poured forth story after story of a time when statesmen
      had the sportive-ness of schoolboys, and the greatest intellects loved to
      indulge in the wildest excesses of folly. A good jest upon Eldon, a smart
      epigram on Sidmouth, a quiz against Vansittart, was a fortune at Court;
      and there grew up thus around the Prince a class who cultivated ridicule
      so assiduously that nothing was too high or too venerable to escape their
      sarcasms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Glencore was only emerging out of boyhood,&mdash;a young subaltern
      in the Prince's own regiment,&mdash;when he first entered this society,
      the impression it had made upon his mind was not the less permanent.
      Independently of the charm of being thus admitted to the most choice
      circle of the land, there was the fascination of intimacy with names that
      even amongst contemporaries were illustrious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel in such spirits to-day, George," cried Glencore at length, "that I
      vote we go and pass the day at Richmond. We shall escape the possibility
      of being bored by your acquaintance. We shall have a glorious stroll
      through the fields, and a pleasant dinner afterwards at the Star and
      Garter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Only too well pleased at this sudden change in his friend's humor,
      Harcourt assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was a bright and clear one, with a sharp, frosty air and that
      elasticity of atmosphere that invigorates and stimulates. They both soon
      felt its influence, and as the hours wore on, pleasant memories of the
      past were related, and old friends remembered and talked over in a spirit
      that brought back to each much of the youthful sentiments they recorded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If one could only go over it all again, George," said Glencore, as they
      sat after dinner, "up to three-and-twenty, or even a year or two later, I
      'd not ask to change a day,&mdash;scarcely an hour. Whatever was deficient
      in fact, was supplied by hope. It was a joyous, brilliant time, when we
      all made partnership of our good spirits, and traded freely on the
      capital. Even Upton was frank and free-hearted then. There were some six
      or eight of us, with just fortune enough never to care about money, and
      none of us so rich as to be immersed in dreams of gold, as ever happens
      with your millionnaire. Why could we not have continued so to the end?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harcourt adroitly turned him from the theme which he saw impending,&mdash;his
      departure for the Continent, his residence there, and his marriage,&mdash;and
      once more occupied him in stories of his youthful life in London, when
      Glencore suddenly came to a stop, and said, "I might have married the
      greatest beauty of the time,&mdash;of a family, too, second to none in all
      England. You know to whom I allude. Well, she would have accepted me; her
      father was not averse to the match; a stupid altercation with her brother,
      Lord Hervey, at Brookes's one night&mdash;an absurd dispute about some
      etiquette of the play-table&mdash;estranged me from their house. I was
      offended at what I deemed their want of courtesy in not seeking me,&mdash;for
      I was in the right; every one said so. I determined not to call first.
      They gave a great entertainment, and omitted me; and rather than stay in
      town to publish this affront, I started for the Continent; and out of that
      petty incident, a discussion of the veriest trifle imaginable, there came
      the whole course of my destiny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure," said Harcourt, with assumed calm, "every man's fortune in
      life is at the sport of some petty incident or other, which at the time he
      undervalues."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then we scoff at those men who scrutinize each move, and hesitate
      over every step in life, as triflers and little-minded; while, if your
      remark be just, it is exactly they who are the wise and prudent," cried
      Glencore, with warmth. "Had I, for instance, seen this occurrence, trivial
      as it was, in its true light, what and where might I not have been
      to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Glencore, the luckiest fellow that ever lived, were he only to
      cast a look back on opportunities neglected, and conjunctures unprofited
      by, would be sure to be miserable. I am far from saying that some have not
      more than their share of the world's sorrows; but, take my word for it,
      every one has his load, be it greater or less; and, what is worse, we all
      of us carry our burdens with as much inconvenience to ourselves as we
      can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know what you would say, Harcourt. It is the old story about giving way
      to passion, and suffering temper to get the better of one; but let me tell
      you that there are trials where passion is an instinct, and reason works
      too slowly. I have experienced such as this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give yourself but fair play, Glencore, and you will surmount all your
      troubles. Come back into the world again,&mdash;I don't mean this world of
      balls and dinner-parties, of morning calls and afternoons in the Park; but
      a really active, stirring life. Come with me to India, and let us have a
      raid amongst the jaguars; mix with the pleasant, light-hearted fellows you
      'll meet at every mess, who ask for nothing better than their own good
      spirits and good health, to content them with the world; just look out
      upon life, and see what numbers are struggling and swimming for existence,
      while you, at least, have competence and wealth for all you wish; and bear
      in mind that round the table where wit is flashing and the merriest
      laughter rings, there is not a man&mdash;no, not one&mdash;who hasn't a
      something heavy in his heart, but yet who'd feel himself a coward if his
      face confessed it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why am I to put this mask upon me? For what and for whom have I to
      wear this disguise?" cried Glencore, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For yourself! It is in bearing up manfully before the world you'll gain
      the courage to sustain your own heart. Ay, Glencore, you 'll do it
      to-morrow. In the presence of royalty you 'll comport yourself with
      dignity and reserve, and you 'll come out from the interview higher and
      stronger in self-esteem."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You talk as if I were some country squire who would stand abashed and
      awe-struck before his King; but remember, my worthy Colonel, I have lived
      a good deal inside the tabernacle, and its mysteries are no secrets to <i>me</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reason the more for what I say!" broke in Harcourt; "your deference will
      not obliterate your judgment; your just respect will not alloy your
      reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll talk to the King, sir, as I talk to you," said Glencore,
      passionately; "nor is the visit of my seeking. I have long since done with
      courts and those who frequent them. What can royalty do for <i>me?</i>
      Upton and yourself may play the courtier, and fawn at levées; you have
      your petitions to present, your favors to beg for; you want to get this,
      or be excused from that: but I am no supplicant; I ask for no place, no
      ribbon. If the King speak to me about my private affairs, he shall be
      answered as I would answer any one who obtrudes his rank into the place
      that should only be occupied by friendship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be that he has some good counsel to offer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Counsel to offer me!" burst in Glencore, with increased warmth. "I would
      no more permit any man to give me advice unasked than I would suffer him
      to go to my tradespeople and pay my debts for me. A man's private sorrows
      are his debts,&mdash;obligations between himself and his own heart. Don't
      tell me, sir, that even a king's prerogative absolves him from the duties
      of a gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      While he uttered these words, he continued to fill and empty his
      wine-glass several times, as if passion had stimulated his thirst; and now
      his flashing eyes and his heightened color betrayed the effect of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us stroll out into the cool air," said Harcourt. "See what a gorgeous
      night of stars it is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you may resume your discourse on patience and resignation!" said
      Glencore, scoffingly. "No, sir. If I must listen to you, let me have at
      least the aid of the decanter. Your bitter maxims are a bad substitute for
      olives, but I must have wine to swallow them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never meant them to be so distasteful to you," said Harcourt,
      good-humoredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, rather, you troubled your head little whether they were or not,"
      replied Glencore, whose voice was now thick from passion and drink
      together. "You and Upton, and two or three others, presume to lecture <i>me</i>&mdash;who,
      because gifted, if you call it gifted&mdash;I'd say cursed&mdash;ay, sir,
      cursed with coarser natures&mdash;temperaments where higher sentiments
      have no place&mdash;fellows that can make what they feel subordinate to
      what they want&mdash;you appreciate <i>that</i>, I hope&mdash;<i>that</i>
      stings you, does it? Well, sir, you'll find me as ready to act as to
      speak. There's not a word I utter here I mean to retract to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Glencore, we have both taken too much wine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak for yourself, sir. If you desire to make the claret the excuse for
      your language, I can only say it's like everything else in your conduct,&mdash;always
      a subterfuge, always a scapegoat. Oh, George, George, I never suspected
      this in you;" and burying his head between his hands, he burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never spoke a word as Harcourt assisted him to the carriage, nor did he
      open his lips on the road homewards.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII. THE VILLA AT SORRENTO
    </h2>
    <p>
      In one of the most sequestered nooks of Sorrento, almost escarped out of
      the rocky cliff, and half hid in the foliage of orange and oleander trees,
      stood the little villa of the Princess Sabloukoff. The blue sea washed the
      white marble terrace before the windows, and the arbutus, whose odor
      scented the drawing-room, dipped its red berries in the glassy water. The
      wildest and richest vegetation abounded on every side. Plants and shrubs
      of tropical climes mingled with the hardier races of Northern lands; and
      the cedar and the plantain blended their leaves with the sycamore and the
      ilex; while, as if to complete the admixture, birds and beasts of remote
      countries were gathered together; and the bustard, the ape, and the
      antelope mixed with the peacock, the chamois, and the golden pheasant. The
      whole represented one of those capricious exhibitions by which wealth so
      often associates itself with the beautiful, and, despite all errors in
      taste, succeeds in making a spot eminently lovely. So was it. There was
      often light where a painter would have wished shadow. There were gorgeous
      flowers where a poet would have desired nothing beyond the blue
      heather-bell. There were startling effects of view, managed where chance
      glimpses through the trees had been infinitely more picturesque. There
      was, in fact, the obtrusive sense of riches in a thousand ways and places
      where mere unadorned nature had been far preferable; and yet, with all
      these faults, sea and sky, rock and foliage, the scented air, the silence,
      only broken by the tuneful birds, the rich profusion of color upon a sward
      strewn with flowers, made of the spot a perfect paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a richly decorated room, whose three windows opened on a marble
      terrace, sat the Princess. It was December; but the sky was cloudless, the
      sea a perfect mirror, and the light air that stirred the leaves soft and
      balmy as the breath of May. Her dress was in keeping with the splendor
      around her: a rich robe of yellow silk fastened up the front with large
      carbuncle buttons; sleeves of deep Valenciennes lace fell far over her
      jewelled fingers; and a scarf of golden embroidery, negligently thrown
      over an arm of her chair, gave what a painter would call the warm color to
      a very striking picture. Farther from the window, and carefully protected
      from the air by a screen, sat a gentleman whose fur-lined pelisse and
      velvet skull-cap showed that he placed more faith in the almanac than in
      the atmosphere. From his cork-soled boots to his shawl muffled about the
      throat, all proclaimed that distrust of the weather that characterizes the
      invalid. No treachery of a hot sun, no seductions of that inveterate
      cheat, a fine day in winter, could inveigle Sir Horace Upton into any
      forgetfulness of his precautions. He would have regarded such as a
      palpable weakness on his part,&mdash;a piece of folly perfectly unbecoming
      in a man of his diplomatic standing and ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was writing, and smoking, and talking by turns, the table before him
      being littered with papers, and even the carpet at his feet strewn with
      the loose sheets of his composition. There was not in his air any of the
      concentration, or even seriousness, of a man engaged in an important
      labor; and yet the work before him employed all his faculties, and he gave
      to it the deepest attention of abilities of which very few possessed the
      equal. To great powers of reasoning and a very strong judgment he united a
      most acute knowledge of men; not exactly of mankind in the mass, but of
      that especial order with whom he had habitually to deal. Stolid,
      commonplace stupidity might puzzle or embarrass him; while for any amount
      of craft, for any degree of subtlety, he was an over-match. The plain
      matter-of-fact intelligence occasionally gained a slight advantage over
      him at first; the trained and polished mind of the most astute negotiator
      was a book he could read at sight. It was his especial tact to catch up
      all this knowledge at once,&mdash;very often in a first interview,&mdash;and
      thus, while others were interchanging the customary platitudes of
      every-day courtesy, he was gleaning and recording within himself the
      traits and characteristics of all around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A clever fellow, very clever fellow, Cineselli," said he, as he continued
      to write. "His proposition is&mdash;certain commercial advantages, and
      that we, on our side, leave him alone to deal his own way with his own
      rabble. I see nothing against it, so long as they continue to be rabble;
      but grubs grow into butterflies, and very vulgar populace have now and
      then emerged into what are called liberal politicians."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only where you have the blessing of a free press," said the Princess, in
      a tone of insolent mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite true, Princess; a free press is a tonic that with an increased dose
      becomes a stimulant, and occasionally over-excites."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It makes your people drunk now and then!" said she, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They always sleep it off over-night," said he, softly. "They very rarely
      pay even the penalty of the morning headache for the excess, which is
      exactly why it will not answer in warmer latitudes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ours is a cold one, and I 'm sure it would not suit us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not so certain of that," said he, languidly. "I think it is eminently
      calculated for a people who don't know how to read."
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have smiled at the remark, if the sarcasm had not offended her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Lordship will therefore see," muttered he, reading to himself as he
      wrote, "that in yielding this point we are, while apparently making a
      concession, in reality obtaining a very considerable advantage&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather an English habit, I suspect," said she, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Picked up in the course of our Baltic trade, Princess. In sending us your
      skins, you smuggled in some of your sentiments; and Russian tallow has
      enlightened the nation in more ways than one!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You need it all, my dear chevalier," said she, with a saucy smile.
      "Harzewitch told me that your diplomatic people were inferior to those of
      the third-rate German States; that, in fact, they never had any
      'information.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know what he calls 'information,' Princess; and his remark is just. Our
      Government is shockingly mean, and never would keep up a good system of
      spies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spies! If you mean by an odious word to inculpate the honor of a high
      calling&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray forgive my interruption, but I am speaking in all good faith. When I
      said 'spy,' it was in the bankrupt misery of a man who had nothing else to
      offer. I wanted to imply that pure but small stream which conveys
      intelligence from a fountain to a river it was not meant to feed. Was n't
      that a carriage I heard in the 'cour'? Oh, pray don't open the window;
      there's an odious <i>libeccio</i> blowing to-day, and there's nothing so
      injurious to the nervous system."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A cabinet messenger, your Excellency," said a servant, entering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a bore! I hoped I was safe from a despatch for at least a month to
      come. I really believe they have no veneration for old institutions in
      England. They don't even celebrate Christmas!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm charmed at the prospect of a bag," cried the Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I have the messenger shown in here, Princess?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly; by all means."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happy to see your Excellency; hope your Ladyship is in good health," said
      a smart-looking young fellow, who wore a much-frogged pelisse, and sported
      a very well-trimmed moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Stevins, how d'ye do?" said Upton. "You've had a cold journey over
      the Cenis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Came by the Splugen, your Excellency. I went round by Vienna, and Maurice
      Esterhazy took me as far as Milan."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess stared with some astonishment. That the messenger should thus
      familiarly style one of that great family was indeed matter of wonderment
      to her; nor was it lessened as Upton whispered her, "Ask him to dine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And London, how is it? Very empty, Stevins?" continued he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A desert," was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's Lord Adderley?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At Brighton. The King can't do without him,&mdash;greatly to Adderley's
      disgust; for he is dying to have a week's shooting in the Highlands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Cantworth, where is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's off for Vienna, and a short trip to Hungary. I met him at dinner at
      the mess while waiting for the Dover packet. By the way, I saw a friend of
      your Excellency's,&mdash;Harcourt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not gone to India?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. They've made him a governor or commander-in-chief of something in the
      Mediterranean; I forget exactly where or what."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have brought me a mighty bag, Stevins," said Upton, sighing. "I had
      hoped for a little ease and rest now that the House is up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are all blue-books, I believe," replied Stevins. "There's that
      blacking your Excellency wrote about, and the cricket-bats; the lathe must
      come out by the frigate, and the down mattress at the same time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just do me the favor to open the bag, my dear Stevins. I am utterly
      without aid here," said Upton, sighing drearily; and the other proceeded
      to litter the table and the floor with a variety of strange and
      incongruous parcels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Report of factory commissioners," cried he, throwing down a weighty
      quarto. "Yarmouth bloaters; Atkinson's cerulean paste for the eyebrows;
      Worcester sauce; trade returns for Tahiti; a set of shoemaking tools;
      eight bottles of Darby's pyloric corrector; buffalo flesh-brushes,&mdash;devilish
      hard they seem; Hume's speech on the reduction of foreign legations;
      novels from Bull's; top-boots for a tiger; and a mass of letters," said
      Stevins, throwing them broadcast over the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No despatches?" cried Upton, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not one, by Jove!" said Stevins.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open one of those Darby's. I 'll take a teaspoonful at once. Will you try
      it, Stevins?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, your Excellency, I never take physic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you dine here, then," said he, with a sly look at the Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to-day, your Excellency. I dine with Grammont at eight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'll not detain you. Come back here to-morrow about eleven or a
      little later. Come to breakfast if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At what hour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know,&mdash;at any hour," sighed Upton, as he opened one of his
      letters and began to read; and Stevins bowed and withdrew, totally
      unnoticed and unrecognized as he slipped from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      One after another Upton threw down, after reading half a dozen lines,
      muttering some indistinct syllables over the dreary stupidity of
      letter-writers in general. Occasionally he came upon some pressing appeal
      for money,&mdash;some urgent request for even a small remittance by the
      next post; and these he only smiled at, while he refolded them with a
      studious care and neatness. "Why will you not help me with this chaos,
      dear Princess?" said he, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am only waiting to be asked," said she; "but I feared that there might
      be secrets&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From you?" said he, with a voice of deep tenderness, while his eyes
      sparkled with an expression far more like raillery than affection. The
      Princess, however, had either not seen or not heeded it, for she was
      already deep in the correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is strictly private. Am I to read it?" said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," said he, bowing courteously. And she read:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Upton,&mdash;Let us have a respite from tariffs and trade-talk for a
      month or two, and tell me rather what the world is doing around you. We
      have never got the right end of that story about the Princess Celestine as
      yet. Who was he? Not Labinsky, I'll be sworn. The K&mdash;&mdash; insists
      it was Roseville, and I hope you may be able to assure me that he is
      mistaken. He is worse tempered than ever. That Glencore business has
      exasperated him greatly. Could n't your Princess,&mdash;the world calls
      her yours ["How good of the world, and how delicate of your friend!" said
      she, smiling superciliously. "Let us see who the writer is. Oh! a great
      man,&mdash;the Lord Adderley," and went on with her reading:] couldn't
      your Princess find out something of real consequence to us about the Q&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What queen does he mean?" cried she, stopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Queen of Sheba, perhaps," said Upton, biting his lips with anger,
      while he made an attempt to take the letter from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon! this is interesting," said she, and went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall want it soon; that is, if the manufacturing districts will not
      kindly afford us a diversion by some open-air demonstrations and a
      collision with the troops. We have offered them a most taking bait, by
      announcing wrongfully the departure of six regiments for India; thus
      leaving the large towns in the North apparently ungarrisoned. They are
      such poltroons that the chances are they 'll not bite! You were right
      about Emerson. We have made his brother a Bishop, and he voted with us on
      the Arms Bill. Cole is a sterling patriot and an old Whig. He says nothing
      shall seduce him from his party, save a Lordship of the Admiralty.
      Corruption everywhere, my dear Upton, except on the Treasury benches!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Holecroft insists on being sent to Petersburg; and having ascertained
      that the Emperor will not accept him, I have induced the K&mdash;&mdash;to
      nominate him to the post. 'Non culpa nostra,' etc. He can scarcely vote
      against us after such an evidence of our good-will. Find out what will
      give most umbrage to your Court, and I will tell you why in my next.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't bother yourself about the Greeks. The time is not come yet, nor
      will it till it suit our policy to loosen the ties with Russia. As to
      France, there is not, nor will there be, in our time at least, any
      Government there. We must deal with them as with a public meeting, which
      may reverse to-morrow the resolutions they have adopted to-day. The French
      will never be formidable till they are unanimous. They 'll never be
      unanimous till we declare war with them! Remember, I don't want anything
      serious with Cineselli. Irritate and worry as much as you can. Send even
      for a ship or two from Malta; but go no farther. I want this for our
      radicals at home. Our own friends are in the secret. Write me a short
      despatch about our good relations with the Two Sicilies; and send me some
      news in a private letter. Let me have some ortolans in the bag, and
      believe me yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adderley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There," said she, turning over a number of letters with a mere glance at
      their contents, "these are all trash,&mdash;shooting and fox-hunting news,
      which one reads in the newspapers better, or at least more briefly,
      narrated, with all that death and marriage intelligence which you English
      are so fond of parading before the world. But what is this literary gem
      here? Where did the paper come from? And that wonderful seal, and still
      more wonderful address?&mdash;'To his Worshipful Excellency the Truly
      Worthy and Right Honorable Sir Horace Upton, Plenipotentiary, Negotiator,
      and Extraordinary Diplomatist, living at Naples.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can it mean?" said he, languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall hear," said she, breaking the massive seal of green wax, which,
      to the size of a crown piece, ornamented one side of the epistle. "It is
      dated Schwats, Tyrol, and begins: 'Venerated and Reverend Excellency, when
      these unsymmetrically-designed, and not more ingeniously-conceived
      syllables&mdash;' Let us see his name," said she, stop-ping suddenly, and
      turning to the last page, read, "'W. T., <i>vulgo</i>, Billy Traynor,&mdash;a
      name cognate to your Worshipful Eminence in times past.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure, I remember him perfectly,&mdash;a strange creature that came
      out here with that boy you heard me speak of. Pray read on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I stopped at 'syllables.' Yes&mdash;when these curiously-conceived
      syllables, then, come under the visionary apertures of your acute
      understanding, they will disclose to your much-reflecting and
      nice-discriminating mind as cruel and murderous a deed as ever a miscreant
      imagination suggested to a diabolically-constructed and
      nefariously-fashioned organization, showing that Nature in her bland
      adaptiveness never imposes a mistaken fruit on a genuine arborescence'&mdash;Do
      you understand him?" asked she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Partly, perhaps," continued he. "Let us have the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Not to weary your exalted and never-enough-to-be-esteemed intelligence,
      I will proceed, without further ambiguous or circumgyratory evolutions, to
      the main body of my allegation. It happened in this way: Charley&mdash;your
      venerated worship knows who I mean&mdash;Charley, ever deep in marmorial
      pursuits, and far progressed in sculptorial excellence, with a genius that
      Phidias, if he did not envy, would esteem&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really I cannot go on with these interminable parentheses," said she;
      "you must decipher them yourself." Upton took the letter, and read it, at
      first hastily, and then, recommencing, with more of care and attention,
      occasionally stopping to reflect, and consider the details. "This is
      likely to be a troublesome business," said he. "This boy has got himself
      into a serious scrape. Love and a duel are bad enough; but an Austrian
      state-prison, and a sentence of twenty years in irons, are even worse. So
      far as I can make out from my not over lucid correspondent, he had
      conceived a violent affection for a young lady at Massa, to whose favor a
      young Austrian of high rank at the same time pretended."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wahnsdorf, I'm certain," broke in the Princess; "and the girl&mdash;that
      Mademoiselle&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harley," interposed Sir Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so,&mdash;Harley. Pray go on," said she, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very serious altercation and a duel were the consequences of this
      rivalry, and Wahnsdorf has been dangerously wounded; his life is still in
      peril. The Harleys have been sent out of the country, and my unlucky <i>protégé</i>,
      handed over to the Austrians, has been tried, condemned, and sentenced to
      twenty years in Kuffstein, a Tyrol fortress where great severity is
      practised,&mdash;from the neighborhood of which this letter is written,
      entreating my speedy interference and protection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can you do? It is not even within your jurisdiction," said she,
      carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True; nor was the capture by the Austrians within theirs, Princess. It is
      a case where assuredly everybody was in the wrong, and, therefore,
      admirably adapted for nice negotiation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who and what is the youth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have called him a <i>protégé</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he no more tender claim to the affectionate solicitude of Sir Horace
      Upton?" said she, with an easy air of sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "None, on my honor," said he, eagerly; "none, at least, of the kind you
      infer. His is a very sad story, which I 'll tell you about at another
      time. For the present, I may say that he is English, and as such must be
      protected by the English authorities. The Government of Massa have clearly
      committed a great fault in handing him over to the Austrians. Stubber must
      be 'brought to book' for this in the first instance. By this we shall
      obtain a perfect insight into the whole affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Imperial family will never forgive an insult offered to one of their
      own blood," said the Princess, haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall not ask them to forgive anything, my dear Princess. We shall
      only prevent their natural feelings betraying them into an act of
      injustice. The boy's offence, whatever it was, occurred outside the
      frontier, as I apprehend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How delighted you English are when you can convert an individual case
      into an international question! You would at any moment sacrifice an
      ancient alliance to the trumpery claim of an aggrieved tourist," said she,
      rising angrily, and swept out of the room ere Sir Horace could arise to
      open the door for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upton walked slowly to the chimney and rang the bell. "I shall want the
      calèche and post-horses at eight o'clock, Antoine. Put up some things for
      me, and get all my furs ready." And with this he measured forty drops from
      a small phial he carried in his waistcoat pocket, and sat down to pare his
      nails with a very diminutive penknife.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII. A DIPLOMATIST'S DINNER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Were we writing a drama instead of a true history, we might like to linger
      for a few moments on the leave-taking between the Princess and Sir Horace
      Upton. They were indeed both consummate "artists," and they played their
      parts to perfection,&mdash;not as we see high comedy performed on the
      stage, by those who grotesque its refinements and exaggerate its dignity;
      "lashing to storm" the calm and placid lake, all whose convulsive throes
      are many a fathom deep, and whose wildest workings never bring a ripple to
      the surface. No, theirs was the true version of well-bred "performance." A
      little well-affected grief at separation, brief as it was meant to be; a
      little half-expressed surprise, on the lady's part, at the suddenness of
      the departure; a little, just as vaguely conveyed, complaint on the other
      side, over the severe requirements of duty, and a very little tenderness&mdash;for
      there was no one to witness it&mdash;at the thought of parting; and with a
      kiss upon her hand, whose respectful courtesy no knight-errant of old
      could have surpassed, Sir Horace backed from the "presence," sighed, and
      slipped away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had our reader been a spectator instead of a peruser of the events we have
      lately detailed, he might have fancied, from certain small asperities of
      manner, certain quicknesses of reproof and readiness at rejoinder, that
      here were two people only waiting for a reasonable and decent pretext to
      go on their separate roads in life. Yet nothing of this kind was the case;
      the bond between them was not affection, it was simply convenience. Their
      partnership gave them a strength and a social solvency which would have
      been sorely damaged had either retired from "the firm;" and they knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would the Princess's dinners have been without the polished ease of
      him who felt himself half the host? What would all Sir Horace Upton's
      subtlety avail him, if it were not that he had sources of information
      which always laid open the game of his adversaries? Singly, each would
      have had a tough struggle with the world; together, they were more than a
      match for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The highest order of diplomatist, in the estimation of Upton, was the man
      who, at once, knew what was <i>possible</i> to be done. It was his own
      peculiar quality to possess this gift; but great as his natural acuteness
      was, it would not have availed him, without those secret springs of
      intelligence we have alluded to. There is no saying to what limit he might
      not have carried this faculty, had it not been that one deteriorating and
      detracting feature marred and disfigured the fairest form of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not, do all that he would, disabuse himself of a very low
      estimate of men and their motives. He did not slide into this philosophy,
      as certain indolent people do, just to save them the trouble of
      discriminating; he did not acquire it by the hard teachings of adversity.
      No; it came upon him slowly and gradually, the fruit, as he believed, of
      calm judgment and much reflection upon life. As little did he accept it
      willingly; he even labored against the conviction: but, strive as he
      might, there it was, and there it would remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fixed impression was, that in every circumstance and event in life
      there was always a <i>dessous des cartes</i>,&mdash;a deeper game
      concealed beneath the surface,&mdash;and that it was a mere question of
      skill and address how much of this penetrated through men's actions. If
      this theory unravelled many a tangled web of knavery to him, it also
      served to embarrass and confuse him in situations where inferior minds had
      never recognized a difficulty! How much ingenuity did he expend to detect
      what had no existence! How wearily did he try for soundings where there
      was no bottom!
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the means of the Princess he had learned&mdash;what some very wise
      heads do not yet like to acknowledge&mdash;that the feeling of the
      despotic governments towards England was very different from what it had
      been at the close of the great war with Napoleon. They had grown more
      dominant and exacting, just as we were becoming every hour more
      democratic. To maintain our old relations with them, therefore, on the old
      footing, would be only to involve ourselves in continual difficulty, with
      a certainty of final failure; and the only policy that remained was to
      encourage the growth of liberal opinions on the Continent, out of which
      new alliances might be formed, to recompense us for the loss of the old
      ones. There is a story told of a certain benevolent prince, whose
      resources were, unhappily, not commensurate with his good intentions, and
      whose ragged retinue wearied him with entreaties for assistance. "Be of
      good cheer," said he, one day, "I have ordered a field of flax to be sown,
      and you shall all of you have new shirts." Such were pretty much the
      position and policy of England. Out of our crop of Constitutionalism we
      speculated on a rich harvest, to be afterwards manufactured for our use
      and benefit. We leave it to deeper heads to say if the result has been all
      that we calculated on, and, asking pardon for such digression, we join Sir
      Horace once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Sir Horace Upton ordered post-horses to his carriage, he no more knew
      where he was going, nor where he would halt, than he could have
      anticipated what course any conversation might take when once started. He
      had, to be sure, a certain ideal goal to be reached; but he was one of
      those men who liked to think that the casual interruptions one meets with
      in life are less obstruction than opportunity; so that, instead of deeming
      these subjects for regret or impatience, he often accepted them as
      indications that there was some profit to be derived from them,&mdash;a
      kind of fatalism more common than is generally believed. When he set out
      for Sorrento it was with the intention of going direct to Massa; not that
      this state lay within the limits his functions ascribed to him,&mdash;that
      being probably the very fact which imparted a zest to the journey. Any
      other man would have addressed himself to his colleague in Tuscany, or
      wherever he might be; while he, being Sir Horace Upton, took the whole
      business upon himself in his own way. Young Massy's case opened to his
      eyes a great question, viz., what was the position the Austrians assumed
      to take in Italy? For any care about the youth, or any sympathy with his
      sufferings, he distressed himself little; not that he was, in any respect,
      heartless or unfeeling, it was simply that greater interests were before
      him. Here was one of those "grand issues" that he felt worthy of his
      abilities,&mdash;it was a cause where he was proud to hold a brief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resolving all his plans of action methodically, yet rapidly; arranging
      every detail in his own mind, even to the use of certain expressions he
      was to employ,&mdash;he arrived at the palace of the Embassy, where he
      desired to halt to take up his letters and make a few preparations before
      his departure. His Maestro di Casa, Signor Franchetti, was in waiting for
      his arrival, and respectfully assured him "that all was in readiness, and
      that his Excellency would be perfectly satisfied. We had, it is true,"
      continued he, "a difficulty about the fish, but I sent off an express to
      Baia, and we have secured a sturgeon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you raving about, caro Pipo?" said the Minister; "what is all
      this long story of Baia and the fish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has your Excellency forgotten that we have a grand dinner to-day, at
      eight o'clock; that the Prince Maximilian of Bavaria and all the foreign
      ambassadors are invited?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this Saturday, Pipo?" said Sir Horace, blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, your Excellency."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send Mr. Brockett to me," said Sir Horace, as he slowly mounted the
      stairs to his own apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Horace was stretched on a sofa, in all the easy luxury of magnificent
      dressing-gown and slippers, when Mr. Brockett entered; and without any
      preliminary of greeting he said, with a quiet laugh, "You have let me
      forget all about the dinner to-day, Brockett!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you knew it; you took great trouble about the persons to be
      asked, and you canvassed whether the Duc de Borodino, being only a Chargé
      d'Affaires&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there; don't you see the&mdash;the inappropriateness of what you
      are doing? Even in England a man is not asked to criminate himself. How
      many are coming?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nineteen; the 'Nonce' is ill, and has sent an apology."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then the party can be eighteen, Brockett; you must tell them that I am
      ill,&mdash;too ill to come to dinner. I know the Prince Max very well,&mdash;he
      'll not take it badly; and as to Cineselli, we shall see what humor he is
      in!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But they 'll know that you arrived here this afternoon; they 'll
      naturally suppose&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They 'll naturally suppose&mdash;if people ever do anything so intensely
      stupid as naturally to suppose anything&mdash;that I am the best judge of
      my own health; and so, Mr. Brockett, you may as well con over the terms by
      which you may best acquaint the company with the reasons for my absence;
      and if the Prince proposes a visit to me in the evening, let him come; he
      'll find me here in my own room. Would you do me the kindness to let
      Antinori fetch his cupping-glasses, and tell Franchetti also that I 'll
      take my chicken grilled, not roasted. I'll look over the treaty in the
      evening. One mushroom, only one, he may give me, and the Carlsbad water,
      at 28 degrees. I 'm very troublesome, Brockett, but I 'm sure you 'll
      excuse it. Thanks, thanks;" and he pressed the Secretary's hand, and gave
      him a smile, whose blandishment had often done good service, and would do
      so again!
    </p>
    <p>
      To almost any other man in the world this interruption to his journey&mdash;this
      sudden tidings of a formally-arranged dinner which he could not or would
      not attend&mdash;would have proved a source of chagrin and
      dissatisfaction. Not so with Upton; he liked a "contrariety." Whatever
      stirred the still waters of life, even though it should be a head-wind,
      was far more grateful than a calm! He laughed to himself at the various
      comments his company were sure to pass over his conduct; he pictured to
      his mind the anger of some and the astonishment of others, and revelled in
      the thought of the courtier-like indignation such treatment of a Royal
      Highness was certain to elicit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who can answer for his health?" said he, with an easy laugh to
      himself. "Who can promise what he may be ten days hence?" The appearance
      of his dinner&mdash;if one may dignify by such a name the half of a
      chicken, flanked by a roasted apple and a biscuit&mdash;cut short his
      lucubrations; and Sir Horace ate and sipped his Carlsbad with as much
      enjoyment as many another man has felt over venison and Chambertin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they arrived, Pipo?" said he, as his servant removed the dessert of
      two figs and a lime.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, your Excellency, they are at table."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How many are there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seventeen, sir, and Mr. Brockett."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did the Prince seem to&mdash;to feel my absence, Pipo?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought he appeared very sorry for your Excellency when Mr. Brockett
      spoke to him, and he whispered something to the aide-de-camp beside him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the others, how did they take it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Count Tarrocco said he'd retire, sir, that he could not dine where the
      host was too ill to receive him; but the Duc de Campo Stretto said it was
      impossible they could leave the room while a 'Royal Highness' continued to
      remain in it; and they all agreed with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Upton, in a low tone. "I hope the dinner is a good
      one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is exquisite, sir; the Prince ate some of the caviare soup, and was
      asking a second time for the 'pain des ortolans' when I left the room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the wine, Pipo? have you given them that rare 'La Rose'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, your Excellency, and the 'Klausthaller cabinet;' his Royal Highness
      asked for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go back, then, now. I want for nothing more; only drop in here by and by,
      and tell me how all goes on. Just light that pastil before you go; there&mdash;that
      will, do."
    </p>
    <p>
      And once more his Excellency was left to himself. In that vast palace,&mdash;the
      once home of a royal prince,&mdash;no sounds of the distant revelry could
      reach the remote quarter where he sat, and all was silent and still around
      him, and Upton was free to ruminate and reflect at ease. There was à sense
      of haughty triumph in thinking that beneath his roof, at that very moment,
      were assembled the great representatives of almost every important state
      of Europe, to whom he had not deigned to accord the honor of his presence;
      but though this thought did flit across his mind, far more was he intent
      on reflecting what might be the consequences&mdash;good or evil&mdash;of
      the incident. "And then," said he, aloud, "how will Printing House Square
      treat us? What a fulminating leader shall we not have, denouncing either
      our insolence or our incompetence, ending with the words: 'If, then, Sir
      Horace Upton be not incapacitated from illness for the discharge of his
      high functions, it is full time for his Government to withdraw him from a
      sphere where his caprice and impertinence have rendered him something
      worse than useless;' and then will come a flood of petty corroborations,&mdash;the
      tourist tribe who heard of us at Berlin, or called upon as at the Hague,
      and whose unreturned cards and uninvited wives are counts in the long
      indictment against us. What a sure road to private friendships is
      diplomacy! How certain is one of conciliating the world's good opinion by
      belonging to it! I wish I had followed the law, or medicine," muttered he;
      "they are both abstruse, both interesting; or been a gardener, or a
      shipwright, or a mathematical instrument maker, or&mdash;" Whatever the
      next choice might have been we know not, for he dropped off asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that pleasant slumber, and a dream of Heaven knows what life of
      Arcadian simplicity, of rippling streams and soft-eyed shepherdesses, he
      was destined to be somewhat suddenly, if not rudely, aroused, as
      Franchetti introduced a stranger who would accept no denial.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your people were not for letting me up, Upton," cried a rich, mellow
      voice; and Harcourt stood before him, bronzed and weather-beaten, as he
      came off his journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, George? Is it possible!" exclaimed Sir Horace; "what best of all
      lucky winds has driven you here? I'm not sure I wasn't dreaming of you
      this very moment. I know I have had a vision of angelic innocence and
      simplicity, which you must have had your part in; but do tell me when did
      you arrive, and whence&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not till I have dined, by Jove! I have tasted nothing since daybreak, and
      then it was only a mere apology for a breakfast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Franchetti, get something, will you?" said Upton, languidly,&mdash;"a
      cutlet, a fowl; anything that can be had at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing of the kind, Signor Franchetti," interposed Harcourt; "if I have
      a wolfs appetite, I have a man's patience. Let me have a real dinner,&mdash;soup,
      fish, an entrée,&mdash;two if you like,&mdash;roast beef; and I leave the
      wind-up to your own discretion, only premising that I like game, and have
      a weakness for woodcocks. By the way, does this climate suit Bordeaux,
      Upton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They tell me so, and mine has a good reputation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then claret be it, and no other wine. Don't I make myself at home, old
      fellow, eh?" said he, clapping Upton on the shoulder. "Have I not taken
      his Majesty's Embassy by storm, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We surrender at discretion, only too glad to receive our vanquisher.
      Well, and how do you find me looking? Be candid: how do I seem to your
      eyes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty much as I have seen you these last fifteen years,&mdash;not an
      hour older, at all events. That same delicacy of constitution is a
      confounded deal better than most men's strong health, for it never wears
      out; but I have always said it, Upton will see us all down!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Horace sighed, as though this were too pleasant to be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said he, at last, "but you have not told me what good chance has
      brought you here. Is it the first post-station on the way to India?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; they've taken me off the saddle, and given me a staff appointment at
      Corfu. I 'm going out second in command there; and whether it was to
      prevent my teasing them for something else, or that there was really some
      urgency in the matter, they ordered me off at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they reinforcing the garrison there?" asked Upton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; not so far as I have heard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It were better policy to do so than to send out a 'commander-in-chief and
      a drummer of great experience,'" muttered Upton to himself; but Harcourt
      could not catch the remark. "Have you any news stirring in England? What
      do the clubs talk about?" asked Sir Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glencore's business occupied them for the last week or so; now, I think,
      it is yourself furnishes the chief topic for speculation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What of me?" asked Upton, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, the rumor goes that you are to have the Foreign Office; Adderley,
      they say, goes out, and Conway and yourself are the favorites, the odds
      being slightly on his side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is all news to me, George," said Upton, with a degree of animation
      that had nothing fictitious about it; "I have had a note from Adderley in
      the last bag, and there's not a word about these changes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly; but perhaps my news is later. What I allude to is said to have
      occurred the day I started."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, very true; and now I remember that the messenger came round by
      Vienna, sent there by Adderley, doubtless," muttered he, "to consult
      Conway before seeing <i>me</i>; and, I have little doubt, with a letter
      for <i>me</i> in the event of Conway declining."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, have you hit upon the solution of it?" said Har-court, who had not
      followed him through his half-uttered observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps so," said Upton, slowly, while he leaned his head upon his hand,
      and fell into a fit of meditation. Meanwhile, Harcourt's dinner made its
      appearance, and the Colonel seated himself at the table with a traveller's
      appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whenever any one has called you a selfish fellow, Upton," said he, as he
      helped himself twice from the same dish, "I have always denied it, and on
      this good ground, that, had you been so, you had never kept the best cook
      in Europe, while unable to enjoy his talents. What a rare artist must this
      be! What's his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pipo, how is he called?" said Upton, languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur Carmael, your Excellency."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, to be sure; a person of excellent family. I've been told he's from
      Provence," said Upton, in the same weary voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could have sworn to his birthplace," cried Harcourt; "no man can manage
      cheese and olives in cookery but a Provençal. Ah, what a glass of
      Bordeaux! To your good health, Upton, and to the day that you may be able
      to enjoy this as I do," said he, as he tossed off a bumper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does me good even to witness the pleasure it yields," said Upton,
      blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove! then, I 'll be worth a whole course of tonics to you, for I most
      thoroughly appreciate all the good things you have given me. By the way,
      how are you off for dinner company here,&mdash;any pleasant people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no health for pleasant people, my dear Harcourt; like horse
      exercise, they only agree with you when you are strong enough not to
      require them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what have you got?" asked the Colonel, somewhat abashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Princes, generals, envoys, and heads of departments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens! legions of honor and golden fleeces!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so," said Upton, smiling at the dismay in the other's countenance;
      "I have had such a party as you describe to-day. Are they gone yet,
      Franchetti?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're at coffee, your Excellency, but the Prince has ordered his
      carriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you did not go near them?" asked Harcourt, in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I was poorly, as you see me," said Upton, smiling. "Pipo tells me,
      however, that the dinner was a good one, and I am sure they pardon my
      absence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Foreign ease, I've no doubt; though I can't say I like it," muttered
      Harcourt. "At all events, it is not for <i>me</i> to complain, since the
      accident has given me the pleasure of your society."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are about the only man I could have admitted," said Upton, with a
      certain graciousness of look and manner that, perhaps, detracted a little
      from its sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, not so to Harcourt's eyes, for he accepted the speech in all
      honesty and good faith, as he said, "Thank you heartily, my boy. The
      welcome is better even than the dinner, and that is saying a good deal. No
      more wine, thank you; I 'm going to have a cigar, and, with your leave, I
      'll ask for some brandy and water."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was addressed to Franchetti, who speedily reappeared with a liqueur
      stand and an ebony cigar-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try these, George; they 're better than your own," said Upton, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I will," cried Harcourt, laughing; "I'm determined to draw all my
      resources from the country in occupation, especially as they are superior
      to what I can obtain from home. This same career of yours, Upton, strikes
      me as rather a good thing. You have all these things duty free?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we have that privilege," said Upton, sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the privilege of drawing some few thousand pounds per annum, paid
      messengers to and from England, secret-service money, and the rest of it,
      eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Upton smiled, and sighed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what do you do for all that,&mdash;I mean, what are you expected to
      do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep your party in when they are in; disconcert the enemy when your
      friends are out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is that always a safe game?" asked Harcourt, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not when played by unskilful players, my dear George. They occasionally
      make sad work, and get bowled out themselves for their pains; but there's
      no great harm in that neither."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you mean there 's no harm in it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simply, that if a man can't keep his saddle, he ought n't to try to ride
      foremost; but these speculations will only puzzle you, my dear Harcourt.
      What of Glencore? You said awhile ago that the town was talking of him&mdash;how
      and wherefore was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't you heard the story, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a word of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm a bad narrator; besides, I don't know where to begin; and even
      if I did, I have nothing to tell but the odds and ends of club gossip, for
      I conclude nobody knows all the facts but the King himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I were given to impatience, George, you would be a most consummate
      plague to me," said Upton; "but I am not. Go on, however, in your own
      blundering way, and leave me to glean what I can <i>in mine</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheered and encouraged by this flattering speech, Harcourt did begin; but,
      more courteous to him than Sir Horace, we mean to accord him a new chapter
      for his revelations; premising the while to our reader that the Colonel,
      like the knife-grinder, had really "no story to tell."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX. A VERY BROKEN NARRATIVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      "You want to hear all about Glencore?" said Harcourt, as, seated in the
      easiest of attitudes in an easy-chair, he puffed his cigar luxuriously;
      "and when I have told you all I know, the chances are you'll be little the
      wiser." Upton smiled a bland assent to this exordium, but in such a way as
      to make Harcourt feel less at ease than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean," said the Colonel, "that I have little to offer you beyond the
      guesses and surmises of club talk. It will be for your own intelligence to
      penetrate through the obscurity afterwards. You understand me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe I understand you," said Upton, slowly, and with the same quiet
      smile. Now, this cold, semi-sarcastic manner of Upton was the one sole
      thing in the world which the honest Colonel could not stand up against; he
      always felt as though it were the prelude to something cutting or
      offensive,&mdash;some sly impertinence that he could not detect till too
      late to resent,&mdash;some insinuation that might give the point to a
      whole conversation, and yet be undiscovered by him till the day following.
      Little as Harcourt was given to wronging his neighbor, he in this instance
      was palpably unjust; Upton's manner being nothing more than the impress
      made upon a very subtle man by qualities very unlike any of his own, and
      which in their newness amused him. The very look of satire was as often an
      expression of sorrow and regret that he could not be as susceptible&mdash;as
      easy of deception&mdash;as those about him. Let us pardon our worthy
      Colonel if he did not comprehend this; shrewder heads than his own had
      made the same mistake. Half to resent this covert slyness, half to arouse
      himself to any conflict before him, he said, in a tone of determination,
      "It is only fair to tell you that you are yourself to blame for anything
      that may have befallen poor Glencore."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I to blame! Why, my dear Harcourt, you are surely dreaming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As wide awake as ever I was. If it had not been for a blunder of yours,&mdash;an
      unpardonable blunder, seeing what has come of it,&mdash;sending a pack of
      trash to me about salt and sulphur, while you forwarded a private letter
      about Glencore to the Foreign Office, all this might not have happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember that it was a most disagreeable mistake. I have paid heavily
      for it, too. That lotion for the cervical vertebrae has come back all
      torn, and we cannot make out whether it be a phosphate or a prot'-oxide of
      bismuth. You don't happen to remember?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?&mdash;of course I know nothing about it. I'd as soon have taken a
      porcupine for a pillow as I 'd have adventured on the confounded mixture.
      But, as I was saying, that blessed letter, written by some Princess or
      other, as I understand, fell into the King's hands, and the consequence
      was that he sent off immediately to Glencore an order to go down to him at
      Brighton. Naturally enough, I thought he 'd not go; he had the good and
      sufficient pretext of his bad health to excuse him. Nobody had seen him
      abroad in the world for years back, and it was easy enough to say that he
      could not bear the journey. Nothing of the kind; he received the command
      as willingly as he might have done an invitation to dinner fifteen years
      ago, and talked of nothing else for the whole evening after but of his old
      days and nights in Carlton House; how gracious the Prince used to be to
      him formerly; how constantly he was a guest at his table; what a brilliant
      society it was; how full of wit and the rest of it; till, by Jove, what
      between drinking more wine than he was accustomed to take, and the
      excitement of his own talking, he became quite wild and unmanageable. He
      was not drunk, nor anything like it, it was rather the state of a man
      whose mind had got some sudden shock; for in the midst of perfectly
      rational conversation, he would fall into paroxysms of violent passion,
      inveighing against every one, and declaring that he never had possessed
      one true-hearted, honest friend in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not without great difficulty that I got him back to my lodgings,
      for we had gone to dine at Richmond. Then we put him to bed, and I sent
      for Hunter, who came on the instant. Though by this time Glencore was much
      more calm and composed, Hunter called the case brain fever; had his hair
      cut quite close, and ice applied to the head. Without any knowledge of his
      history or even of his name, Hunter pronounced him to be a man whose
      intellect had received some terrible shock, and that the present was
      simply an acute attack of a long-existent malady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he use any irritants?" asked Upton, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; he advised nothing but the cold during the night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! what a mistake," sighed Upton, heavily. "It was precisely the case
      for the cervical lotion I was speaking of. Of course he was much worse
      next morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That he was; not as regarded his reason, however, for he could talk
      collectedly enough, but he was irritable and passionate to a degree
      scarcely credible: would not endure the slightest opposition, and so
      suspectful of everything and everybody that if he overheard a whisper it
      threw him into a convulsion of anger. Hunter's opinion was evidently a
      gloomy one, and he said to me as we went downstairs, 'He may come through
      it with life, but scarcely with a sound intellect.' This was a heavy blow
      to <i>me</i>, for I could not entirely acquit myself of the fault of
      having counselled this visit to Brighton, which I now perceived had made
      such a deep impression upon him. I roused myself, however, to meet the
      emergency, and walked down to St. James's to obtain some means of letting
      the King know that Glencore was too ill to keep his appointment.
      Fortunately, I met Knighton, who was just setting off to Brighton, and who
      promised to take charge of the commission. I then strolled over to
      Brookes's to see the morning papers, and lounged till about four o'clock,
      when I turned homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gloomy and sad I was as I reached my door, and rang the bell with a
      cautious hand. They did not hear the summons, and I was forced to ring
      again, when the door was opened by my servant, who stood pale and
      trembling before me. 'He's gone, sir,&mdash;he's gone,' cried he, almost
      sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Good Heaven!' cried I. 'Dead?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No, sir, gone away,&mdash;driven off, no one knows where. I had just
      gone out to the chemist's, and was obliged to call round at Doctor
      Hunter's about a word in the prescription they could n't read, and when I
      came back he was away.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I then ascertained that the carriage which had been ordered the day
      before at a particular hour, and which we had forgotten to countermand,
      had arrived during my servant's absence. Glencore, hearing it stop at the
      door, inquired whose it was, and as suddenly springing out of bed,
      proceeded to dress himself, which he did, in the suit he had ordered to
      wait on the King. So apparently reasonable was he in all he said, and such
      an air of purpose did he assume, that the nurse-tender averred she could
      not dare to interpose, believing that his attack might possibly be some
      sort of passing access that he was accustomed to, and knew best how to
      deal with.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not lose a moment, but, ordering post-horses, pursued him with all
      speed. On reaching Croydon, I heard he had passed about two hours before;
      but though I did my best, it was in vain. I arrived at Brighton late at
      night, only to learn that a gentleman had got out at the Pavilion, and had
      not left it since.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not believe that all I have ever suffered in my life equalled what I
      went through in the two weary hours that I passed walking up and down
      outside that low paling that skirts the Palace garden. The poor fellow, in
      all his misery, came before me in so many shapes; sometimes wandering in
      intellect&mdash;sometimes awake and conscious of his sufferings&mdash;now
      trying to comport himself as became the presence he was in&mdash;now
      reckless of all the world and everything. What could have happened to
      detain him so long? What had been the course of events since he passed
      that threshold? were questions that again and again crossed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tried to make my way in,&mdash;I know not exactly what I meant to do
      afterwards; but the sentries refused me admittance. I thought of scaling
      the enclosure, and reaching the Palace through the garden; but the police
      kept strict watch on every side. At last, it was nigh twelve o'clock, that
      I heard a sentry challenge some one, and shortly after a figure passed out
      and walked towards the pier. I followed, determined to make inquiry, no
      matter of whom. He walked so rapidly, however, that I was forced to run to
      overtake him. This attracted his notice; he turned hastily, and by the
      straggling moonlight I recognized Glencore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He stood for a moment still, and beckoning me towards him, he took my arm
      in silence, and we walked onward in the direction of the sea-shore. It was
      now a wild and gusty night. The clouds drifted fast, shutting out the moon
      at intervals, and the sea broke harshly along the strand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot tell you the rush of strange and painful emotions which came
      upon me as I thus walked along, while not a word passed between us. As for
      myself, I felt that the slightest word from me might, perhaps, change the
      whole current of his thoughts, and thus destroy my only chance of any clew
      to what was passing within him. 'Are you cold?' said he, at length,
      feeling possibly a slight tremor in my arm. 'Not cold, exactly,' said I,
      'but the night is fresh, and I half suspect too fresh for <i>you</i>.'
      'Feel that,' said he, placing his hand in mine; and it was burning. 'The
      breeze that comes off the sea is grateful to me, for I am like one on
      fire.' Then I am certain, my dear Glencore,' said I, 'that this is a great
      imprudence. Let us turn back, towards the inn.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "He made no reply, but with a rough motion of his arm moved forward as
      before. 'Three hours and more,' said he, with a full and stern utterance,
      'they kept me waiting. There were Ministers with the King; there was some
      foreign envoy, too, to be presented; and if I had not gone in alone and
      unannounced, I might still be in the ante-chamber. How he stared at me,
      Harcourt, and my close-cropped hair. It was <i>that</i> seemed first to
      strike him, as he said, "Have you had an illness lately?" He looked
      poorly, too, bloated and pale, and like one who fretted, and I told him
      so. "We are both changed, sir," said I,&mdash;"sadly changed since we met
      last. We might almost begin to hope that another change is not far off,&mdash;the
      last and the best one." I don't remember what he answered. It was, I
      think, something about who came along with me from town, and who was with
      me at Brighton,&mdash;I forget exactly; but I know that he sent for
      Knighton, and made him feel my pulse. "You'll find it rapid enough, I 've
      no doubt, Sir William," said I. "I rose from a sick bed to come here; his
      Majesty had deigned to wish to see me." Then the King stopped me, and made
      a sign to Knighton to withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Was n't it a strange situation, Harcourt, to be seated there beside the
      King, alone? None other present,&mdash;all to ourselves,&mdash;talking as
      you and I might talk of what interested us most of all the world; and <i>he</i>
      showing me that letter,&mdash;the letter that ought to have come to <i>me</i>.
      How he could do it I know not. Neither you nor I, George, could have done
      so; for, after all, she was, ay, and she <i>is</i>, his wife. He could not
      avail himself of <i>my</i> stratagem. I said so too, and he answered, "Ay,
      but I can divorce her if one half of that be true;" and he pointed to the
      letter. "The Lady Glencore," said he, "must know everything, and be
      willing to tell it too. She has paid the heaviest penalty ever woman paid
      for another. Read that." And I read it,&mdash;ay, I read it four times,
      five times over; and then my brain began to burn, and a thousand fancies
      flitted across me, and though he talked on, I heard not a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"But that lady is my wife, sir," broke I in; "and what a part do you
      assign her! She is to be a spy, a witness, perhaps, in some infamous
      cause. How shall I, a peer of the realm, endure to see my name thus
      degraded? Is it Court favor can recompense me for lost or tarnished
      honor?" "But it will be her own vindication," said he. Her own
      vindication,&mdash;these were the words, George; <i>she</i> should be
      clear of all reproach. By Heaven, he said so, that I might declare it
      before the world. And then it should be proved!&mdash;be proved! How base
      a man can be, even though he wear a crown! Just fancy his proposition! But
      I spurned it, and said, "You must seek for some one with a longer chance
      of life, sir, to do this; my days are too brief for such dishonor;" and he
      was angry with me, and said I had forgotten the presence in which I stood.
      It was true, I had forgotten it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'He called me a wretched fool, too, as I tore up that letter. That was
      wrong in me, Harcourt, was it not? I did not see him go, but I found
      myself alone in the room, and I was picking up the fragments of the letter
      as they entered. They were less than courteous to me, though I told them
      who I was,&mdash;an ancient barony better than half the modern
      marquisates. I gave them date and place for a creation that smacked of
      other services than theirs. Knighton would come with me, but I shook him
      off. Your Court physician can carry his complaisance even to poison. By
      George! it is their chief office, and I know well what snares are now in
      store for me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "And thence he went on to say that he would hasten back to his Irish
      solitude, where none could trace him out. That there his life, at least,
      would be secure, and no emissaries of the King dare follow him. It was in
      vain I tried to induce him to return, even for one night, to the hotel;
      and I saw that to persist in my endeavors would be to hazard the little
      influence I still possessed over him. I could not, however, leave the poor
      fellow to his fate without at least the assurance of a home somewhere, and
      so I accompanied him to Ireland, and left him in that strange old ruin
      where we once sojourned together. His mind had gradually calmed down, but
      a deep melancholy had gained entire possession of him, and he passed whole
      days without a word. I saw that he often labored to recall some of the
      events of the interview with the King; but his memory had not retained
      them, and he seemed like one eternally engaged in some problem which his
      faculties could not solve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I left him and arrived in town, I found the clubs full of the
      incident, but evidently without any real knowledge of what had occurred;
      since the version was that Glencore had asked an audience of the King, and
      gone down to the Pavilion to read to his Majesty a most atrocious
      narrative of the Queen's life in Italy, offering to substantiate&mdash;through
      his Italian connection&mdash;every allegation it contained,&mdash;a
      proposal that, of course, was only received by the King in the light of an
      insult; and that this reception, so different from all his expectations,
      had turned his head and driven him completely insane!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe now I have told you everything as I heard it; indeed, I have
      given you Glencore's own words, since, without them, I could not convey to
      you what he intended to say. The whole affair is a puzzle to me, for I am
      unable to tell when the poor fellow's brain was wandering, and when he
      spoke under the guidance of right reason. You, of course, have the clew to
      it all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I! How so?" cried Upton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have seen the letter which caused all the trouble; you know its
      contents, and what it treats of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true; I must have read it; but I have not the slightest recollection
      of what it was about. There was something, I know, about Glencore's boy,&mdash;he
      was called Greppi, though, and might not have been recognized; and there
      was some gossip about the Princess of Wales&mdash;the Queen, as they call
      her now&mdash;and her ladies; but I must frankly confess it did not
      interest me, and I have forgotten it all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the writer of the letter to be come at?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing easier. I'll take you over to breakfast with her to-morrow
      morning; you shall catechise her yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! she is then&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is the Princess Sabloukoff, my dear George, and a very charming
      person, as you will be the first to acknowledge. But as to this interview
      at Brighton, I fancy&mdash;even from the disjointed narrative of Glencore&mdash;one
      can make a guess of what it portended. The King saw that my Lady Glencore&mdash;for
      so we must call her&mdash;knew some very important facts about the Queen,
      and wished to obtain them; and saw, too, that certain scandals, as the
      phrase goes, which attached to her ladyship, lay at another door. He
      fancied, not unreasonably, perhaps, that Glencore would be glad to hear
      this exculpation of his wife; and he calculated that by the boon of this
      intelligence he could gain over Glencore to assist him in his project for
      a divorce. Don't you perceive, Harcourt, of what an inestimable value it
      would prove, to possess one single gentleman, one man or one woman of
      station, amid all this rabble that they are summoning throughout the world
      to bring shame upon England?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you incline to believe Lady Glencore blameless?" asked Harcourt,
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think well of every one, my charming Colonel. It is the only true
      philosophy in life. Be as severe as you please on all who injure yourself,
      but always be lenient to the faults that only damage your friends. You
      have no idea how much practical wisdom the maxim contains, nor what a fund
      of charity it provides."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm ashamed to be so stupid, but I must come back to my old question. Is
      all this story against Glencore's wife only a calumny?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I must fall back upon my old remark, that all the rogues in the world
      are in jail; the people you see walking about and at large are
      unexceptionably honest,&mdash;every man of them. Ah, my dear
      deputy-assistant, adjutant, or commissary, or whatever it be, can you not
      perceive the more than folly of these perquisitions into character? You
      don't require that the ice should be strong enough to sustain a
      twenty-four pounder before you venture to put foot on it,&mdash;enough
      that it is quite equal to your own weight; and so of the world at large,&mdash;everybody,
      or nearly everybody, has virtue enough for all we want with him. This
      English habit&mdash;for it is essentially English&mdash;of eternally
      investigating everything, is like the policy of a man who would fire a
      round-shot every morning at his house, to see if it were well and securely
      built."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't, I can't agree with you," cried Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so, my dear fellow; only don't give me your reasons, and at least I
      shall respect your motives."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you do, then, in Glencore's place? Let me ask you that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may as well inquire how I should behave if I were a quadruped. Don't
      you perceive that I never could, by any possibility, place myself in such
      a false position? The man who, in a case of difficulty, takes counsel from
      his passions, is exactly like one, who being thirsty, fills himself out a
      bumper of aquafortis and drinks it off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish with all my heart you 'd give up aphorisms, and just tell me how
      we could serve this poor fellow; for I feel that there is a gleam of light
      breaking through his dark fortunes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When a man is in the state Glencore is now in, the best policy is to let
      him alone. They tell us that when Murat's blood was up, the Emperor always
      left him to his own guidance, since he either did something excessively
      brilliant, or made such a blunder as recalled him to subjection again. Let
      us treat our friend in this fashion, and wait. Oh, my worthy Colonel, if
      you but knew what a secret there is in that same waiting policy. Many a
      game is won by letting the adversary move out of his turn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If all this subtlety be needed to guide a man in the plain road of life,
      what is to become of poor simple fellows like myself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let them never go far from home, Harcourt, and they 'll always find their
      way back," said Upton; and his eyes twinkled with quiet drollery. "Come,
      now," said he, with perfect good-nature of look and voice, "If I won't
      tell you what I should counsel Glencore in this emergency, I 'll do the
      next best thing, I' ll tell you what advice you'd give him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us hear it, then," said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd send him abroad to search out his wife; ask her forgiveness for all
      the wrong he has done her; call out any man that whispered the shadow of a
      reproach against her; and go back to such domesticity as it might please
      Heaven to accord him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, if the woman has been unjustly dealt with&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's the rock you always split on: you are everlastingly in search of
      a character. Be satisfied when you have eaten a hearty breakfast, and
      don't ask for a bill of health. Researches are always dangerous. My great
      grandfather, who had a passion for genealogy, was cured of it by
      discovering that the first of the family was a staymaker! Let the lesson
      not be lost on us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From all which I am to deduce that you 'd ask no questions,&mdash;take
      her home again, and say nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget, Harcourt, we are now discussing the line of action <i>you</i>
      would recommend; I am only hinting at the best mode of carrying out <i>your</i>
      ideas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just for the pleasure of showing me that I did n't know how to walk in
      the road I made myself," said Harcourt, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a happy laugh that was, Harcourt! How plainly, too, it said, 'Thank
      Heaven I 'm not like that fellow, with all his craft!' And you are right
      too, my dear friend; if the devil were to walk the world now, he 'd be
      bored beyond endurance, seeing nothing but the old vices played over again
      and again. And so it is with all of us who have a spice of his nature;
      we'd give anything to see one new trick on the cards. Good night, and
      pleasant dreams to you!" And with a sigh that had in its cadence something
      almost painful, he gave his two fingers to the honest grasp of the other,
      and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a better fellow than you think yourself, or wish any one else to
      believe you," muttered Harcourt, as he puffed his cigar; and he ruminated
      over this reflection till it was bedtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Harcourt was right.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL. UPTONISM
    </h2>
    <p>
      About noon on the following day, Sir Horace Upton and the Colonel drove up
      to the gate of the villa at Sorrento, and learned, to their no small
      astonishment, that the Princess had taken her departure that morning for
      Como. If Upton heard these tidings with a sense of pain, nothing in his
      manner betrayed the sentiment; on the contrary, he proceeded to do the
      honors of the place like its owner. He showed Harcourt the grounds and the
      gardens, pointed out all the choice points of view, directed his attention
      to rare plants and curious animals; and then led him within doors to
      admire the objects of art and luxury which abounded there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that, I conclude, is a portrait of the Princess," said Harcourt, as
      he stood before what had been a flattering likeness twenty years back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and a wonderful resemblance," said Upton, eying it through his
      glass. "Fatter and fuller now, perhaps; but it was done after an illness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove!" muttered Harcourt, "she must be beautiful; I don't think I ever
      saw a handsomer woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are only repeating a European verdict. She is the most perfectly
      beautiful woman of the Continent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So there is no flattery in that picture?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Flattery! Why, my dear fellow, these people, the very cleverest of them,
      can't imagine anything as lovely as that. They can imitate,&mdash;they
      never invent real beauty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And clever, you say, too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Esprit</i> enough for a dozen reviewers and fifty fashionable
      novelists." And as he spoke he smiled and coquetted with the portrait, as
      though to say, "Don't mind my saying all this to your face."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose her history is a very interesting one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her history, my worthy Harcourt! She has a dozen histories. Such women
      have a life of politics, a life of literature, a life of the <i>salons</i>,
      a life of the affections, not to speak of the episodes of jealousy,
      ambition, triumph, and sometimes defeat, that make up the brilliant web of
      their existence. Some three or four such people give the whole character
      and tone to the age they live in. They mould its interests, sway its
      fashions, suggest its tastes, and they finally rule those who fancy that
      they rule mankind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Egad, then, it makes one very sorry for poor mankind," muttered Harcourt,
      with a most honest sincerity of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should it do so, my good Harcourt? Is the refinement of a woman's
      intellect a worse guide than the coarser instincts of a man's nature?
      Would you not yourself rather trust your destinies to the fair creature
      yonder than be left to the legislative mercies of that old gentleman
      there, Hardenberg, or his fellow on the other side, Metternich?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Grim-looking fellow the Prussian; the other is much better," said
      Harcourt, rather evading the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I confess I prefer the Princess," said Upton, as he bowed before the
      portrait in deepest courtesy. "But here comes breakfast. I have ordered
      them to give it to us here, that we may enjoy that glorious sea view while
      we eat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought your cook a man of genius, Upton, but this fellow is his
      master," said Harcourt, as he tasted his soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are brothers,&mdash;twins, too; and they have their separate gifts,"
      said Upton, affectedly. "My fellow, they tell me, has the finer
      intelligence; but he plays deeply, speculates on the Bourse, and it spoils
      his nerve."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harcourt watched the delivery of this speech to catch if there were any
      signs of raillery in the speaker; he felt that there was a kind of mockery
      in the words; but there was none in the manner, for there was not any in
      the mind of him who uttered them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My <i>chef</i>," resumed Upton, "is a great essayist, who must have time
      for his efforts. This fellow is a <i>feuilleton</i> writer, who is
      required to be new and sparkling every day of the year,&mdash;always
      varied, never profound."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is this your life of every day?" said Harcourt, as he surveyed the
      splendid room, and carried his glance towards the terraced gardens that
      flanked the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty much this kind of thing," sighed Upton, wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And no great hardship either, I should call it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, certainly not," said the other, hesitatingly. "To one like myself,
      for instance, who has no health for the wear and tear of public life, and
      no heart for its ambitions, there is a great deal to like in the quiet
      retirement of a first-class mission."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there really, then, nothing to do?" asked Harcourt, innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, if you don't make it for yourself. You can have a harvest if you
      like to sow. Otherwise, you may lie in fallow the year long. The
      subordinates take the petty miseries of diplomacy for <i>their</i> share,&mdash;the
      sorrows of insulted Englishmen, the passport difficulties, the
      custom-house troubles, the police insults. The Secretary calls at the
      offices of the Government, carries messages and the answers; and I, when I
      have health for it, make my compliments to the King in a cocked hat on his
      birthday, and have twelve grease-pots illuminated over my door to honor
      the same festival."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is that all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very nearly. In fact, when one does anything more, they generally do
      wrong; and by a steady persistence in this kind of thing for thirty years,
      you are called 'a safe man, who never compromised his Government,' and are
      certain to be employed by any party in power."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I begin to think I might be an envoy myself," said Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt of it; we have two or three of your calibre in Germany this
      moment,&mdash;men liked and respected; and, what is of more consequence,
      well looked upon at 'the Office.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't exactly follow you in that last remark."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I scarcely expected you should; and as little can I make it clear to you.
      Know, however, that in that venerable pile in Downing Street called the
      Foreign Office, there is a strange, mysterious sentiment,&mdash;partly
      tradition, partly prejudice, partly toadyism,&mdash;which bands together
      all within its walls, from the whiskered porter at the door to the
      essenced Minister in his bureau, into one intellectual conglomerate, that
      judges of every man in 'the Line'&mdash;as they call diplomacy&mdash;with
      one accord. By that curious tribunal, which hears no evidence, nor ever
      utters a sentence, each man's merits are weighed; and to stand well in the
      Office is better than all the favors of the Court, or the force of great
      abilities."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I cannot comprehend how mere subordinates, the underlings of official
      life, can possibly influence the fortunes of men so much above them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Picture to yourself the position of an humble guest at a great man's
      table; imagine one to whose pretensions the sentiments of the servants'
      hall are hostile: he is served to all appearance like the rest of the
      company; he gets his soup and his fish like those about him, and his
      wine-glass is duly replenished,&mdash;yet what a series of petty
      mortifications is he the victim of; how constantly is he made to feel that
      he is not in public favor; how certain, too, if he incur an awkwardness,
      to find that his distresses are exposed. The servants' hall is the Office,
      my dear Harcourt, and its persecutions are equally polished."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you a favorite there yourself?" asked the other, slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A prime favorite; they all like <i>me!</i>" said he, throwing himself
      back in his chair, with an air of easy self-satisfaction; and Harcourt
      stared at him, curious to know whether so astute a man was the dupe of his
      own self-esteem, or merely amusing himself with the simplicity of another.
      Ah, my good Colonel, give up the problem; it is an enigma far above your
      powers to solve. That nature is too complex for <i>your</i> elucidation;
      in its intricate web no one thread holds the clew, but all is complicated,
      crossed, and entangled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here comes a cabinet messenger again," said Upton, as a courier's <i>calèche</i>
      drove up, and a well-dressed and well-looking fellow leaped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Stanhope, how are you?" said Sir Horace, shaking his hand with what
      from him was warmth. "Do you know Colonel Harcourt? Well, Frank, what news
      do you bring me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best of news."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From F. O., I suppose," said Upton, sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so. Adderley has told the King you are the only man capable to
      succeed him. The Press says the same, and the clubs are all with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not one of them all, I'd venture to say, has asked whether I have the
      strength or health for it," said Sir Horace, with a voice of pathetic
      intonation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, as we never knew you want energy for whatever fell to your lot to
      do, we have the same hope still," said Stanhope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So say I too," cried Harcourt. "Like many a good hunter, he 'll do his
      work best when he is properly weighted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is quite refreshing to listen to you both&mdash;creatures with
      crocodile digestion&mdash;talk to a man who suffers nightmare if he
      over-eat a dry biscuit at supper. I tell you frankly, it would be the
      death of me to take the Foreign Office. I 'd not live through the season,&mdash;the
      very dinners would kill me; and then, the House, the heat, the turmoil,
      the worry of opposition, and the jaunting back and forward to Brighton or
      to Windsor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      While he muttered these complaints, he continued to read with great
      rapidity the letters which Stanhope had brought him, and which, despite
      all his practised coolness, had evidently afforded him pleasure in the
      perusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adderley bore it," continued he, "just because he was a mere machine,
      wound up to play off so many despatches, like so many tunes; and then, he
      permitted a degree of interference on the King's part I never could have
      suffered; and he liked to be addressed by the King of Prussia as 'Dear
      Adderley.' But what do I care for all these vanities? Have I not seen
      enough of the thing they call the great world? Is not this retreat better
      and dearer to me than all the glare and crash of London, or all the pomp
      and splendor of Windsor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove! I suspect you are right, after all," said Harcourt, with an
      honest energy of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were I younger, and stronger in health, perhaps," said Upton, "this might
      have tempted me. Perhaps I can picture to myself what I might have made of
      it; for you may perceive, George, these people have done nothing: they
      have been pouring hot water on the tea-leaves Pitt left them,&mdash;no
      more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you 'd have a brewing of your own, I 've no doubt," responded the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd at least have foreseen the time when this compact, this Holy
      Alliance, should become impossible; when the developed intelligence of
      Europe would seek something else from their rulers than a well-concocted
      scheme of repression. I 'd have provided for the hour when England must
      either break with her own people or her allies; and I 'd have inaugurated
      a new policy, based upon the enlarged views and extended intelligence of
      mankind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm not certain that I quite apprehend you," muttered Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter; but you can surely understand that if a set of mere
      mediocrities have saved England, a batch of clever men might have done
      something more. She came out of the last war the acknowledged head of
      Europe: does she now hold that place, and what will she be at the next
      great struggle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "England is as great as ever she was," cried Harcourt, boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Greater in nothing is she than in the implicit credulity of her people!"
      sighed Upton. "I only wish I could have the same faith in my physicians
      that she has in hers! By the way, Stanhope, what of that new fellow they
      have got at St. Leonard's? They tell me he builds you up in some
      preparation of gypsum, so that you can't move or stir, and that the
      perfect repose thus imparted to the system is the highest order of
      restorative."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They were just about to try him for manslaughter when I left England,"
      said Stanhope, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As often the fate of genius in these days as in more barbarous times,"
      said Upton. "I read his pamphlet with much interest. If you were going
      back, Harcourt, I 'd have begged of you to try him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I 'm forced to say, I'd have refused you flatly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet it is precisely creatures of robust constitution, like you, that
      should submit themselves to these trials, for the sake of humanity. Frail
      organizations, like mine, cannot brave these ordeals. What are they
      talking of in town? Any gossip afloat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The change of ministry is the only topic. Glencore's affair has worn
      itself out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was that about Glencore?" asked Upton, half indolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A strange story; one can scarcely believe it. They say that Glencore,
      hearing of the King's great anxiety to be rid of the Queen, asked an
      audience of his Majesty, and actually suggested, as the best possible
      expedient, that his Majesty should deny the marriage. They add that he
      reasoned the case so cleverly, and with such consummate craft and skill,
      it was with the greatest difficulty that the King could be persuaded that
      he was deranged. Some say his Majesty was outraged beyond endurance;
      others, that he was vastly amused, and laughed immoderately over it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the world, how do they pronounce upon it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are two great parties,&mdash;one for Glencore's sanity the other
      against; but, as I said before, the cabinet changes have absorbed all
      interest latterly, and the Viscount and his case are forgotten; and when I
      started, the great question was, who was to have the Foreign Office."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe I could tell them one who will not," said Upton, with a
      melancholy smile. "Dine with me, both of you, to-day, at seven; no
      company, you know. There is an opera in the evening, and my box is at your
      service, if you like to go; and so, till then;" and with a little gesture
      of the hand he waved an adieu, and glided from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry he's not up to the work of office," said Har-court; "there's
      plenty of ability in him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best man we have," said Stanhope; "so they say at the Office."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's gone to lie down, I take it; he seemed much exhausted. What say you
      to a walk back to town?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ask nothing better," said Stanhope; and they started for Naples.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI. AN EVENING IN FLORENCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      That happy valley of the Val d'Arno, in which fair Florence stands,
      possesses, amidst all its virtues, none more conspicuous than the blessed
      forgetfulness of the past, so eminently the gift of those who dwell there.
      Faults and follies of a few years back have so faded by time as to be
      already historical; and as, in certain climates, rocks and stones become
      shrined by lichens, and moss-covered in a year or two, so here, in equally
      brief space, bygones are shrouded and shadowed in a way that nothing short
      of cruelty and violence could once more expose to view.
    </p>
    <p>
      The palace where Lady Glencore once displayed all her attractions of
      beauty and toilette, and dispensed a hospitality of princely splendor, had
      remained for a course of time close barred and shut up. The massive gate
      was locked, the windows shuttered, and curious tourists were told that
      there were objects of interest within, but it was impossible to obtain
      sight of them. The crowds who once flocked there at nightfall, and whose
      equipages filled the court, now drove on to other haunts, scarcely
      glancing as they passed at the darkened casements of the grim old edifice;
      when at length the rumor ran that "some one" had arrived there. Lights
      were seen in the porter's lodge, the iron <i>grille</i> was observed to
      open and shut, and tradespeople came and went within the building; and,
      finally, the assurance gained ground that its former owner had returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only think who has come back to us," said one of the idlers of the
      Cascine, as he lounged on the steps of a fashionable carriage,&mdash;"La
      Nina!" And at once the story went far and near, repeated at every corner,
      and discussed in every circle; so that had a stranger to the place but
      caught the passing sounds, he would have heard that one name uttered in
      every group he encountered. La Nina! and why not the Countess of Glencore,
      or, at least, the Countess de la Torre? As when exiled royalists assume
      titles in accordance with fallen fortunes, so, in Italy, injured fame
      seeks sympathy in the familiarity of the Christian name, and "Society" at
      once accepts the designation as that of those who throw themselves upon
      the affectionate kindness of the world, rather than insist upon its
      reverence and respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of her former friends were still there; but there was also a numerous
      class, principally foreigners, who only knew of her by repute. The
      traditions of her beauty, her gracefulness, the charms of her demeanor,
      and the brilliancy of her diamonds, abounded. Her admirers were of all
      ages, from those who worshipped her loveliness to that not less
      enthusiastic section who swore by her cook; and it was indeed "great
      tidings" to hear that she had returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some statistician has asserted that no less than a hundred thousand people
      awake every day in London, not one of whom knows where he will pass the
      night. Now, Florence is but a small city, and the lacquered-boot class
      bear but a slight proportion to the shoeless herd of humanity. Yet there
      is a very tolerable sprinkling of well-dressed, well-got-up individuals,
      who daily arise without the very vaguest conception of who is to house
      them, fire them, light them, and cigar them for the evening. They are an
      interesting class, and have this strong appeal to human sympathy, that not
      one of them, by any possible effort, could contribute to his own support.
    </p>
    <p>
      They toil not, neither do they spin. They have the very fewest of social
      qualities; they possess no conversational gifts; they are not even
      moderately good reporters of the passing events of the day. And yet,
      strange to say, the world they live in seems to have some need of them.
      Are they the last relics of a once gifted class,&mdash;worn out, effete,
      and exhausted,&mdash;degenerated like modern Greeks from those who once
      shook the Parthenon? Or are they what anatomists call "rudimentary
      structures,"&mdash;the first abortive attempts of nature to fashion
      something profitable and good? Who knows?
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst this class the Nina's arrival was announced as the happiest of all
      tidings; and speculation immediately set to work to imagine who would be
      the favorites of the house; what would be its habits and hours; would she
      again enter the great world of society, or would she, as her quiet,
      unannounced arrival portended, seek a less conspicuous position? Nor was
      this the mere talk of the cafés and the Cascine. The <i>salons</i> were
      eagerly discussing the very same theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      In certain social conditions a degree of astuteness is acquired as to who
      may and who may not be visited, that, in its tortuous intricacy of
      reasons, would puzzle the craftiest head that ever wagged in Equity. Not
      that the code is a severe one; it is exactly in its lenity lies its
      difficulty,&mdash;so much may be done, but so little may be fatal! The
      Countess in the present case enjoyed what in England is reckoned a great
      privilege,&mdash;she was tried by her peers&mdash;or "something more."
      They were, however, all nice discriminators as to the class of case before
      them, and they knew well what danger there was in admitting to their
      "guild" any with a little more disgrace than their neighbors. It was
      curious enough that she, in whose behalf all this solicitude was excited,
      should have been less than indifferent as to the result; and when, on the
      third day of the trial, a verdict was delivered in her favor, and a shower
      of visiting-cards at the porter's lodge declared that the act of her
      recognition had passed, her orders were that the cards should be sent back
      to their owners, as the Countess had not the honor of their acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Les grands coups se font respecter toujours," was the maxim of a great
      tactician in war and politics; and the adage is no less true in questions
      of social life. We are so apt to compute the strength of resources by the
      amount of pretension that we often yield the victory to the mere
      declaration of force. We are not, however, about to dwell on this theme,&mdash;our
      business being less with those who discussed her, than with the Countess
      of Glencore herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a large <i>salon</i>, hung with costly tapestries, and furnished in the
      most expensive style, sat two ladies at opposite sides of the fire. They
      were both richly dressed, and one of them (it was Lady Glencore), as she
      held a screen before her face, displayed a number of valuable rings on her
      fingers, and a massive bracelet of enamel with a large emerald pendant.
      The other, not less magnificently attired, wore an imperial portrait
      suspended by a chain around her neck, and a small knot of white and green
      ribbon on her shoulder, to denote her quality of a lady in waiting at
      Court. There was something almost queenly in the haughty dignity of her
      manner, and an air of command in the tone with which she addressed her
      companion. It was our acquaintance the Princess Sabloukoff, just escaped
      from a dinner and reception at the Pitti Palace, and carrying with her
      some of the proud traditions of the society she had quitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What hour did you tell them they might come, Nina?" asked she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not before midnight, my dear Princess; I wanted to have a talk with you
      first. It is long since we have met, and I have so much to tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Cara mia</i>," said the other, carelessly, "I know everything already.
      There is nothing you have done, nothing that has happened to you, that I
      am not aware of. I might go further, and say that I have looked with
      secret pleasure at the course of events which to your short-sightedness
      seemed disastrous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can scarce conceive that possible," said the Countess, sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naturally enough, perhaps, because you never knew the greatest of all
      blessings in this life, which is&mdash;liberty. Separation from your
      husband, my dear Nina, did not emancipate you from the tiresome
      requirements of the world. You got rid of <i>him</i>, to be sure, but not
      of those who regarded you as his wife. It required the act of courage by
      which you cut with these people forever, to assert the freedom I speak
      of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I almost shudder at the contest I have provoked, and had you not insisted
      on it&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had gone back again to the old slavery, to be pitied and
      compassionated, and condoled with, instead of being feared and envied,"
      said the other; and as she spoke, her flashing eyes and quivering brows
      gave an expression almost tiger-like to her features. "What was there
      about your house and its habits distinctive before? What gave you any
      pre-eminence above those that surround you? You were better looking,
      yourself; better dressed; your <i>salons</i> better lighted; your dinners
      more choice,&mdash;there was the end of it. <i>Your</i> company was <i>their</i>
      company,&mdash;<i>your</i> associates were <i>theirs</i>. The homage <i>you</i>
      received to-day had been yesterday the incense of another. There was not a
      bouquet nor a flattery offered to <i>you</i> that had not its <i>facsimile</i>,
      doing service in some other quarter. You were 'one of them,' Nina, obliged
      to follow their laws and subscribe to their ideas; and while <i>they</i>
      traded on the wealth of your attractions, <i>you</i> derived nothing from
      the partnership but the same share as those about you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how will it be now?" asked the Countess, half in fear, half in hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How will it be now? I 'll tell you. This house will be the resort of
      every distinguished man, not of Italy, but of the world at large. Here
      will come the highest of every nation, as to a circle where they can say,
      and hear, and suggest a thousand things in the freedom of unauthorized
      intercourse. You will not drain Florence alone, but all the great cities
      of Europe, of its best talkers and deepest thinkers. The statesman and the
      author, and the sculptor and the musician, will hasten to a neutral
      territory, where for the time a kind of equality will prevail. The weary
      minister, escaping from a Court festival, will come here to unbend; the
      witty converser will store himself with his best resources for your <i>salons</i>.
      There will be all the freedom of a club to these men, with the added charm
      of that fascination your presence will confer; and thus, through all their
      intercourse, will be felt the '<i>parfum de femme</i>,' as Balzac calls
      it, which both elevates and entrances."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But will not society revenge itself on all this?" "It will invent a
      hundred calumnious reports and shocking stories; but these, like the
      criticisms on an immoral play, will only serve to fill the house. Men&mdash;even
      the quiet ones&mdash;will be eager to see what it is that constitutes the
      charm of these gatherings; and one charm there is that never misses its
      success. Have you ever experienced, in visiting some great gallery, or,
      still more, some choice collection of works of art, a strange, mysterious
      sense of awe for objects which you rather knew to be great by the
      testimony of others, than felt able personally to appreciate? You were
      conscious that the picture was painted by Raphael, or the cup carved by
      Cellini, and, independently of all the pleasure it yielded you, arose a
      sense of homage to its actual worth. The same is the case in society with
      illustrious men. They may seem slower of apprehension, less ready at
      reply, less apt to understand; but there they are, Originals, not Copies
      of greatness. They represent value."
    </p>
    <p>
      Have we said enough to show our reader the kind of persuasion by which
      Madame de Sabloukoff led her friend into this new path? The flattery of
      the argument was, after all, its success; and the Countess was fascinated
      by fancying herself something more than the handsomest and the
      best-dressed woman in Florence. They who constitute a free port of their
      house will have certainly abundance of trade, and also invite no small
      amount of enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little after midnight the <i>salons</i> began to fill, and from the
      Opera and the other theatres flocked in all that was pleasant,
      fashionable, and idle of Florence. The old beau, painted, padded, and
      essenced, came with the younger and not less elaborately dressed
      "fashionable," great in watch-chains and splendid in waistcoat buttons;
      long-haired artists and moustached hussars mingled with close-shaven
      actors and pale-faced authors; men of the world, of politics, of finance,
      of letters, of the turf,&mdash;all were there. There was the gossip of the
      Bourse and the cabinet, the green-room and the stable. The scandal of
      society, the events of club life, the world's doings in dinners, divorces,
      and duels, were all revealed and discussed, amidst the most profuse
      gratitude to the Countess for coming back again to that society which
      scarcely survived her desertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not, it is but fair to say, all that the Princess Sabloukoff had
      depicted them; but there was still a very fair sprinkling of witty,
      pleasant talkers. The ease of admission permitted any former intimate to
      present his friend, and thus at once, on the very first night of
      receiving, the Countess saw her <i>salons</i> crowded. They smoked, and
      sang, and laughed, and played écarte, and told good stories. They drew
      caricatures, imitated well-known actors, and even preachers, talking away
      with a volubility that left few listeners; and then there was a supper
      laid out on a table too small to accommodate even by standing, so that
      each carried away his plate, and bivouacked with others of his friends,
      here and there, through the rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was contrived to impart a sense of independence and freedom; all, to
      convey an impression of "license" special to the place, that made the most
      rigid unbend, and relaxed the gravity of many who seldom laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in certain chemical compounds a mere drop of some one powerful
      ingredient will change the whole property of the mass, eliciting new
      elements, correcting this, developing that, and, even to the eye,
      announcing by altered color the wondrous change accomplished, so here the
      element of womanhood, infinitely small in proportion as it was, imparted a
      tone and a refinement to this orgie which, without it, had degenerated
      into coarseness. The Countess's beautiful niece, Ida Delia Torre, was also
      there, singing at times with all an artist's excellence the triumphs of
      operatic music; at others, warbling over those "canzonettes" which to
      Italian ears embody all that they know of love of country. How could such
      a reception be other than successful; or how could the guests, as they
      poured forth into the silent street at daybreak, do aught but exult that
      such a house was added to the haunts of Florence,&mdash;so lovely a group
      had returned to adorn their fair city?
    </p>
    <p>
      In a burst of this enthusiastic gratitude they sang a serenade before they
      separated; and then, as the closed curtains showed them that the inmates
      had left the windows, they uttered the last "felice Notte," and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so Wahnsdorf never made his appearance?" said the Princess, as she
      was once more alone with the Countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I scarcely expected him. He knows the ill-feeling towards his countrymen
      amongst Italians, and he rarely enters society where he may meet them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is strange that he should marry one!" said she, half musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He fell in love,&mdash;there's the whole secret of it," said the
      Countess. "He fell in love, and his passion encountered certain
      difficulties. His rank was one of them, Ida's indifference another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how have they been got over?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Evaded rather than surmounted. He has only his own consent after all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Ida, does she care for him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suspect not; but she will marry him. Pique will often do what affection
      would fail in. The secret history of the affair is this: There was a youth
      at Massa, who, while he lived there, made our acquaintance and became even
      intimate at the Villa: he was a sculptor of some talent, and, as many
      thought, of considerable promise. I engaged him to give Ida lessons in
      modelling, and, in this way, they were constantly together. Whether Ida
      liked him or not I cannot say; but it is beyond a doubt that he loved her.
      In fact, everything he produced in his art only showed what his mind was
      full of,&mdash;her image was everywhere. This aroused Wahnsdorf's
      jealousy, and he urged me strongly to dismiss Greppi, and shut my doors to
      him. At first I consented, for I had a strange sense, not exactly of
      dislike, but misgiving, of the youth. I had a feeling towards him that if
      I attempted to convey to you, it would seem as though in all this affair I
      had suffered myself to be blinded by passion, not guided by reason. There
      were times that I felt a deep interest in the youth: his genius, his
      ardor, his very poverty engaged my sympathy; and then, stronger than all
      these, was a strange, mysterious sense of terror at sight of him, for he
      was the very image of one who has worked all the evil of my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was not this a mere fancy?" said the Princess, compassionately, for she
      saw the shuddering emotion these words had cost her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not alone his look," continued the Countess, speaking now with
      impetuous eagerness, "it was not merely his features, but their every play
      and movement; his gestures when excited; the very voice was <i>his</i>. I
      saw him once excited to violent passion; it was some taunt that Wahnsdorf
      uttered about men of unknown or ignoble origin; and then He&mdash;he
      himself seemed to stand before me as I have so often seen him, in his
      terrible outbursts of rage. The sight brought back to me the dreadful
      recollection of those scenes,&mdash;scenes," said she, looking wildly
      around her, "that if these old walls could speak, might freeze your heart
      where you are sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have heard, but you cannot know, the miserable life we led together;
      the frantic jealousy that maddened every hour of his existence; how, in
      all the harmless freedom of our Italian life, he saw causes of suspicion
      and distrust; how, by his rudeness to this one, his coldness to that, he
      estranged me from all who have been my dearest intimates and friends,
      dictating to me the while the custom of a land and a people I had never
      seen nor wished to see; till at last I was left a mockery to some, an
      object of pity to others, amidst a society where once I reigned supreme,&mdash;and
      all for a man that I had ceased to love! It was from this same life of
      misery, unrewarded by the affection by which jealousy sometimes
      compensates for its tyranny, that I escaped, to attach myself to the
      fortunes of that unhappy Princess whose lot bore some resemblance to my
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know well that he ascribed my desertion to another cause, and&mdash;shall
      I own it to you?&mdash;I had a savage pleasure in leaving him to the
      delusion. It was the only vengeance within my reach, and I grasped it with
      eagerness. Nothing was easier for me than to disprove it,&mdash;a mere
      word would have shown the falsehood of the charge; but I would not utter
      it. I knew his nature well, and that the insult to his name and the stain
      to his honor would be the heaviest of all injuries to him; and they were
      so. He drove <i>me</i> from my home,&mdash;I banished <i>him</i> from the
      world. It is true, I never reckoned on the cruel blow he had yet in store
      for me, and when it fell I was crushed and stunned. There was now a
      declared war between us,&mdash;each to do their worst to the other. It was
      less succumbing before him, than to meditate and determine on the future,
      that I fled from Florence. It was not here and in such a society I should
      have to blush for any imputation. But I had always held my place proudly,
      perhaps too proudly, here, and I did not care to enter upon that campaign
      of defence&mdash;that stooping to cultivate alliances, that humble game of
      conciliation&mdash;that must ensue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I went away into banishment. I went to Corsica, and thence to Massa. I
      was meditating a journey to the East. I was even speculating on
      establishing myself there for the rest of my life, when your letters
      changed my plans. You once more kindled in my heart a love of life by
      instilling a love of vengeance. You suggested to me the idea of coming
      back here boldly, and confronting the world proudly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not mistake me, Nina," said the Princess, "the 'Vendetta' was the last
      thing in my thoughts. I was too deeply concerned for you to be turned away
      from my object by any distracting influence. It was that you should give a
      bold denial&mdash;the boldest&mdash;to your husband's calumny, I
      counselled your return. My advice was: Disregard, and, by disregarding,
      deny the foul slander he has invented. Go back to the world in the rank
      that is yours and that you never forfeited, and then challenge him to
      oppose your claim to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you think that for such a consideration as this&mdash;the honor to
      bear the name of a man I loathe&mdash;that I 'd face that world I know so
      well? No, no; believe me, I had very different reasons. I was resolved
      that my future life, <i>my</i> name, <i>his</i> name, should gain a
      European notoriety. I am well aware that when a woman is made a public
      talk, when once her name comes sufficiently often before the world, let it
      be for what you will,&mdash;her beauty, her will, her extravagance, her
      dress,&mdash;from that hour her fame is perilled, and the society she has
      overtopped take their vengeance in slandering her character. To be before
      the world as a woman is to be arraigned. If ever there was a man who
      dreaded such a destiny for his wife, it was <i>he</i>. The impertinences
      of the Press had greater terrors for his heart than aught else in life,
      and I resolved that he should taste them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How have you mistaken, how have you misunderstood me, Nina!" said the
      Princess, sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so," cried she, eagerly. "You only saw one advantage in the plan you
      counselled. <i>I</i> perceived that it contained a double benefit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But remember, dearest Nina, revenge is the most costly of all pleasures,
      if one pays for it with all that they possess&mdash;their tranquillity. I
      myself might have indulged such thoughts as yours; there were many points
      alike in our fortunes: but to have followed such a course would be like
      the wisdom of one who inoculates himself with a deadly malady that he may
      impart the poison to another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must I again tell you that in all I have done I cared less how it might
      serve <i>me</i> than how it might wound <i>him?</i> I know you cannot
      understand this sentiment; I do not ask of you to sympathize with it. <i>Your</i>
      talents enabled you to shape out a high and ambitious career for yourself.
      You loved the great intrigues of state, and were well fitted to conduct or
      control them. None such gifts were mine. I was and I am still a mere
      creature of society. I never soared, even in fancy, beyond the triumphs
      which the world of fashion decrees. A cruel destiny excluded me from the
      pleasures of a life that would have amply satisfied me, and there is
      nothing left but to avenge myself on the cause."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dearest Nina, with all your self-stimulation you cannot make yourself
      the vindictive creature you would appear," said the Princess, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How little do you know my Italian blood!" said the other, passionately.
      "That boy&mdash;he was not much more than boy&mdash;that Greppi was, as I
      told you, the very image of Glencore. The same dark skin, the same heavy
      brow, the same cold, stern look, which even a smile did not enliven; even
      to the impassive air with which he listened to a provocation,&mdash;all
      were alike. Well, the resemblance has cost him dearly. I consented at last
      to Wahnsdorf's continual entreaty to exclude him from the Villa, and
      charged the Count with the commission. I am not sure that he expended an
      excess of delicacy on the task; I half fear me that he did the act more
      rudely than was needed. At all events, a quarrel was the result, and a
      challenge to a duel. I only knew of this when all was over; believe me, I
      should never have permitted it. However, the result was as safe in the
      hands of Fate. The youth fled from Massa; and though Wahnsdorf followed
      him, they never met."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was no duel, you say?" cried the Princess, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could there be? This Greppi never went to the rendezvous. He quitted
      Massa during the night, and has never since been heard of. In this, I own
      to you, he was not like <i>him.</i>" And, as she said the words, the tears
      swam in her eyes, and rolled down her cheeks. "May I ask you how you
      learned all this?" "From Wahnsdorf; on his return, in a week or two, he
      told me all. Ida, at first, would not believe it; but how could she
      discredit what was plain and palpable? Greppi was gone. All the inquiries
      of the police were in vain as to his route; none could guess how he had
      escaped."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this account was given you&mdash;you yourself&mdash;by Wahnsdorf?"
      repeated the Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, to myself. Why should he have concealed it?" "And now he is to marry
      Ida?" said the Princess, half musingly, to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We hope, with <i>your</i> aid, that it may be so. The family difficulties
      are great; Wahnsdorf s rank is not ours; but he persists in saying that to
      your management nothing is impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His opinion is too flattering," said the Princess, with a cold gravity of
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you surely will not refuse us your assistance?" "You may count upon
      me even for more than you ask," said the Princess, rising. "How late it
      is! day is breaking already!" And so, with a tender embrace, they parted.

      CHAPTER XLIII. MADAME DE SABBLOUKOFF IN THE MORNING
    </h2>
    <p>
      Madame de Sabloukoff inhabited "the grand apartment" of the Hôtel
      d'Italie, which is the handsomest quarter of the great hotel of Florence.
      The same suite which had once the distinguished honor of receiving a Czar
      and a King of Prussia, and Heaven knows how many lesser potentates! was
      now devoted to one who, though not of the small number of the
      elect-in-purple, was yet, in her way, what politicians calls a
      "puissance."
    </p>
    <p>
      As in the drama a vast number of agencies are required for the due
      performance of a piece, so, on the greater stage of life, many of the
      chief motive powers rarely are known to the public eye. The Princess was
      of this number. She was behind the scenes, in more than one sense, and had
      her share in the great events of her time.
    </p>
    <p>
      While her beauty lasted, she had traded on the great capital of
      attractions which were unsurpassed in Europe. As the perishable flower
      faded, she, with prudential foresight, laid up a treasure in secret
      knowledge of people and their acts, which made her dreaded and feared
      where she was once admired and flattered. Perhaps&mdash;it is by no means
      improbable&mdash;she preferred this latter tribute to the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the strong sunlight was tempered by the closed jalousies and the
      drawn muslin curtains, she sat with her back to the window, so that her
      features were but dimly visible in the darkened atmosphere of the room.
      There was something of coquetry in this; but there was more,&mdash;there
      was a dash of semi-secrecy in the air of gloom and stillness around, which
      gave to each visitor who presented himself,&mdash;and she received but one
      at a time,&mdash;an impression of being admitted to an audience of
      confidence and trust. The mute-like servant who waited in the corridor
      without, and who drew back a massive curtain on your entrance, also aided
      the delusion, imparting to the interview a character of mysterious
      solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through that solemn portal there had passed, in and out, during the
      morning, various dignitaries of the land, ministers and envoys, and grand
      "chargés" of the Court. The embroidered key of the Chamberlain and the
      purple stockings of a Nuncio had come and gone; and now there was a Brief
      pause, for the groom in waiting had informed the crowd in the antechamber
      that the Princess could receive no more. Then there was a hurried
      scrawling of great names in a large book, a shower of visiting-cards, and
      all was over; the fine equipages of fine people dashed off, and the
      courtyard of the hotel was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The large clock on the mantelpiece struck three, and Madame de Sabloukoff
      compared the time with her watch, and by a movement of impatience showed a
      feeling of displeasure. She was not accustomed to have her appointments
      lightly treated, and he for whom she had fixed an hour was now thirty
      minutes behind his time. She had been known to resent such unpunctuality,
      and she looked as though she might do so again. "I remember the day when
      his grand-uncle descended from his carriage to speak to me," muttered she;
      "and that same grand-uncle was an emperor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the chance reflection of her image in the large glass before her
      somewhat embittered the recollection, for her features flushed, and as
      suddenly grew pale again. It may have been that her mind went rapidly back
      to a period when her fascination was a despotism that even the highest and
      the haughtiest obeyed. "Too true," said she, speaking to herself, "time
      has dealt heavily with us all. But <i>they</i> are no more what they once
      were than am I. Their old compact of mutual assistance is crumbling away
      under the pressure of new rivalries and new pretensions. Kings and Kaisers
      will soon be like bygone beauties. I wonder will they bear their altered
      fortune as heroically?" It is but just to say that her tremulous accents
      and quivering lip bore little evidence of the heroism she spoke of.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rang the bell violently, and as the servant entered she said, but in a
      voice of perfect unconcern,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the Count von Wahnsdorf calls, you will tell him that I am engaged,
      but will receive him to-morrow&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why not to-day, charming Princess?" said a young man, entering
      hastily, and whose graceful but somewhat haughty air set off to every
      advantage his splendid Hungarian costume. "Why not now?" said he, stooping
      to kiss her hand with respectful gallantry. She motioned to the servant to
      withdraw, and they were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not over exact in keeping an appointment, monsieur," said she,
      stiffly. "It is somewhat cruel to remind me that my claims in this respect
      have grown antiquated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancied myself the soul of punctuality, my dear Princess," said he,
      adjusting the embroidered pelisse he wore over his shoulder. "You
      mentioned four as the hour&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said three o'clock," replied she, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three, or four, or even five,&mdash;what does it signify?" said he,
      carelessly. "We have not either of us, I suspect, much occupation to
      engage us; and if I have interfered with your other plans&mdash;if you
      have plans&mdash;A thousand pardons!" cried he, suddenly, as the deep
      color of her face and her flashing eye warned him that he had gone too
      far; "but the fact is, I was detained at the riding-school. They have sent
      me some young horses from the Banat, and I went over to look at them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Count de Wahnsdorf knows that he need make no apologies to Madame de
      Sabloukoff," said she, calmly; "but it were just as graceful, perhaps, to
      affect them. My dear Count," continued she, but in a tone perfectly free
      from all touch of irritation, "I have asked to see and speak with you on
      matters purely your own&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want to dissuade me from this marriage," said he, interrupting; "but
      I fancy that I have already listened to everything that can be urged on
      that affair. If you have any argument other than the old one about
      misalliance and the rest of it, I 'll hear it patiently; though I tell you
      beforehand that I should like to learn that a connection with an imperial
      house had some advantage besides that of a continual barrier to one's
      wishes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand," said she, quietly, "that you named the terms on which you
      would abandon this project,&mdash;is it not so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who told <i>you</i> that?" cried he, angrily. "Is this another specimen
      of the delicacy with which ministers treat a person of my station?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To discuss that point, Count, would lead us wide of our mark. Am I to
      conclude that my informant was correct?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can I tell what may have been reported to you?" said he, almost
      rudely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall hear and judge for yourself," was the calm answer. "Count
      Kollorath informed me that you offered to abandon this marriage on
      condition that you were appointed to the command of the Pahlen Hussars."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man's face became scarlet with shame, and he tried twice to
      speak, but unavailingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a merciless slowness of utterance, and a manner of the most unmoved
      sternness, she went on: "I did not deem the proposal at all exorbitant. It
      was a price that they could well afford to pay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, they refused me," said he, bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not exactly refused you," said she, more gently. "They reminded you of
      the necessity of conforming&mdash;of at least appearing to conform&mdash;to
      the rules of the service; that you had only been a few months in command
      of a squadron; that your debts, which were considerable, had been noised
      about the world, so that a little time should elapse, and a favorable
      opportunity present itself, before this promotion could be effected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How correctly they have instructed you in all the details of this
      affair!" said he, with a scornful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a rare event when I am misinformed, sir," was her cold reply; "nor
      could it redound to the advantage of those who ask my advice to afford me
      incorrect information."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I am quite unable to perceive what you want with <i>me</i>." cried
      he. "It is plain enough you are in possession of all that I could tell
      you. Or is all this only the prelude to some menace or other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no other answer to this rude question than by a smile so dubious
      in its meaning, it might imply scorn, or pity, or even sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not wonder if I be angry," continued he, in an accent that
      betokened shame at his own violence. "They have treated me so long as a
      fool that they have made me something worse than one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not offended by your warmth, Count," said she, softly. "It is at
      least the guarantee of your sincerity. I tell you, therefore, I have no
      threat to hold over you. It will be enough that I can show you the
      impolicy of this marriage,&mdash;I don't want to use a stronger word,&mdash;what
      estrangement it will lead to as regards your own family, how inadequately
      it will respond to the sacrifices it must cost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That consideration is for me to think of, madam," said he, proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And for your friends also," interposed she, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If by my friends you mean those who have watched every occasion of my
      life to oppose my plans and thwart my wishes, I conclude that they will
      prove themselves as vigilant now as heretofore; but I am getting somewhat
      weary of this friendship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Count, give me a patient&mdash;if possible, an indulgent&mdash;hearing
      for five minutes, or even half that time, and I hope it will save us both
      a world of misconception. If this marriage that you are so eager to
      contract were an affair of love,&mdash;of that ardent, passionate love
      which recognizes no obstacle nor acknowledges any barrier to its wishes,&mdash;I
      could regard the question as one of those everyday events in life whose
      uniformity is seldom broken by a new incident; for love stories have a
      terrible sameness in them." She smiled as she said this, and in such a way
      as to make him smile at first, and then laugh heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if," resumed she, seriously,&mdash;"if I only see in this project a
      mere caprice, half&mdash;more than half&mdash;based upon the pleasure of
      wounding family pride, or of coercing those who have hitherto dictated to
      you; if, besides this, I perceive that there is no strong affection on
      either side, none of that impetuous passion which the world accepts as
      'the attenuating circumstance' in rash marriages&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who has told you that I do not love Ida, or that she is not devoted
      with her whole heart to <i>me?</i>" cried he, interrupting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You yourself have told the first. You have shown by the price you have
      laid on the object the value at which you estimate it. As for the latter
      part of your question&mdash;" She paused, and arranged the folds of her
      shawl, purposely playing with his impatience, and enjoying it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," cried he, "as for the latter part; go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It scarcely requires an answer. I saw Ida Delia Torre last night in a
      society of which her affianced husband was not one; and, I will be bold
      enough to say, hers was not the bearing that bespoke engaged affections."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" said he, but in a tone that indicated neither displeasure nor
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was as I have told you, Count. Surrounded by the youth of Florence,
      such as you know them, she laughed, and talked, and sang, in all the
      careless gayety of a heart at ease; or, if at moments a shade of sadness
      crossed her features, it was so brief that only one observing her closely
      as myself could mark it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how did that subtle intelligence of yours interpret this show of
      sorrow?" said he, in a voice of mockery, but yet of deep anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My subtle intelligence was not taxed to guess, for I knew her secret,"
      said the Princess, with all the strength of conscious power.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her secret&mdash;her secret!" said he, eagerly. "What do you mean by
      that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess smiled coldly, and said, "I have not yet found my frankness
      so well repaid that I should continue to extend it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the reward to be, madam? Name it," said he, boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same candor on your part, Count; I ask for no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what have I to reveal; what mystery is there that your omniscience
      has not penetrated?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There may be some that your frankness has not avowed, my dear Count."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you refer to what you have called Ida's secret&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," broke she in. "I was now alluding to what might be called <i>your</i>
      secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine! <i>my</i> secret!" exclaimed he. But though the tone was meant to
      convey great astonishment, the confusion of his manner was far more
      apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your secret, Count," she repeated slowly, "which has been just as safe in
      my keeping as if it had been confided to me on honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was not aware how much I owed to your discretion, madam," said he,
      scoffingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am but too happy when any services of mine can rescue the fame of a
      great family from reproach, sir," replied she, proudly; for all the
      control she had heretofore imposed upon her temper seemed at last to have
      yielded to offended dignity. "Happily for that illustrious house&mdash;happily
      for you, too&mdash;I am one of a very few who know of Count Wahnsdorf's
      doings. To have suffered your antagonist in a duel to be tracked,
      arrested, and imprisoned in an Austrian fortress, when a word from you had
      either warned him of his peril or averted the danger, was bad enough; but
      to have stigmatized his name with cowardice, and to have defamed him
      because he was your rival, was far worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wahnsdorf struck the table with his clenched fist till it shook beneath
      the blow, but never uttered a word, while with increased energy she
      continued,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every step of this bad history is known to me; every detail of it, from
      your gross and insulting provocation of this poor friendless youth to the
      last scene of his committal to a dungeon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, of course, you have related your interesting narrative to Ida?"
      cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir; the respect which I have never lost for those whose name you
      bear had been quite enough to restrain me, had I not even other thoughts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what may they be?" asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To take the first opportunity of finding myself alone with you, to
      represent how nearly it concerns your honor that this affair should never
      be bruited abroad; to insist upon your lending every aid to obtain this
      young man's liberation; to show that the provocation came from yourself;
      and, lastly, all-painful though it be, to remove from him the stain you
      have inflicted, and to reinstate him in the esteem that your calumny may
      have robbed him of. These were the other thoughts I alluded to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you fancy that I am to engage in this sea of trouble for the sake of
      some nameless bastard, while in doing so I compromise myself and my own
      honor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you prefer that it should be done by another, Count Wahnsdorf?" asked
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a threat, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the speedier will the matter be settled if you understand it as
      such."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, of course, the next condition will be for me to resign my
      pretensions to Ida in his favor," said he, with a savage irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I stipulate for nothing of the sort; Count Wahnsdorf's pretensions will
      be to-morrow just where they are to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hold them cheaply, madam. I am indeed unfortunate in all my pursuit
      of your esteem."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You live in a sphere to command it, sir," was her reply, given with a
      counterfeited humility; and whether it was the tone of mingled insolence
      and submission she assumed, or simply the sense of his own unworthiness in
      her sight, but Wahnsdorf cowered before her like a frightened child. At
      this moment the servant entered, and presented a visiting-card to the
      Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, he comes in an opportune moment," cried she. "This is the Minister of
      the Duke of Massa's household,&mdash;the Chevalier Stubber. Yes,"
      continued she to the servant, "I will receive him."
    </p>
    <p>
      If there was not any conspicuous gracefulness in the Chevalier's approach,
      there was an air of quiet self-possession that bespoke a sense of his own
      worth and importance; and while he turned to pay his respects to the young
      Count, his unpolished manner was not devoid of a certain dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a fortunate chance by which I find you here, Count Wahnsdorf," said
      he, "for you will be glad to learn that the young fellow you had that
      affair with at Massa has just been liberated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When, and how?" cried the Princess, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to the time, it must be about four days ago, as my letters inform me;
      as to the how, I fancy the Count can best inform you,&mdash;he has
      interested himself greatly in the matter." The Count blushed deeply, and
      turned away to hide his face, but not so quickly as to miss the expression
      of scornful meaning with which the Princess regarded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I want to hear the details, Chevalier," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I can give you none, madam. My despatches simply mention that the act
      of arrest was discovered in some way to be informal. Sir Horace Upton
      proved so much. There then arose a question of giving him up to us; but my
      master declined the honor,&mdash;he would have no trouble, he said, with
      England or Englishmen; and some say that the youth claims an English
      nationality. The cabinet of Vienna are, perhaps, like-minded in the
      matter; at all events, he is free, and will be here to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I shall invite him to dinner, and beg both of you gentlemen to meet
      him," said she, with a voice wherein a tone of malicious drollery mingled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am your servant, madam," said Stubber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I am engaged," said Wahnsdorf, taking up his shako.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are off to Vienna to-night, Count Wahnsdorf," whispered the
      Princess-in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean, madam?" said he, in a tone equally low.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only that I have a letter written for the Archduchess Sophia, which I
      desire to intrust to your hands. You may as well read ere I seal it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count took the letter from her hand, and retired towards the window to
      read it. While she conversed eagerly with Stubber, she did not fail from
      time to time to glance towards the other, and mark the expression of his
      features as he folded and replaced the letter in its envelope, and, slowly
      approaching her, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are most discreet, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope I am just, sir," said she, modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This was something of a difficult undertaking, too," said he, with an
      equivocal smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was certainly a pleasant and proud one, sir, as it always must be, to
      write to a mother in commendation of her son. By the way, Chevalier, you
      have forgotten to make your compliments to the Count on his promotion&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not heard of it, madam; what may it be?" asked Stubber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the command of the Pahlen Hussars, sir,&mdash;one of the proudest
      'charges' of the Empire."
    </p>
    <p>
      A rush of blood to Wahnsdorf's face was as quickly followed by a deadly
      pallor, and with a broken, faint utterance he said, "Good-bye," and left
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fine young fellow,&mdash;the very picture of a soldier," exclaimed
      Stubber, looking after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A chevalier of the olden time, sir,&mdash;the very soul of honor," said
      the Princess, enthusiastically. "And now for a little gossip with
      yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not "in our brief" to record what passed in that chatty interview;
      plenty of state secrets and state gossip there was,&mdash;abundance of
      that dangerous trifling which mixes up the passions of society with the
      great game of politics, and makes statecraft feel the impress of men's
      whims and caprices. We were just beginning that era, "the policy of
      resentments," which has since pervaded Europe, and the Chevalier and the
      Princess were sufficiently behind the scenes to have many things to
      communicate; and here we must leave them while we hasten on to other
      scenes and other actors.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII. DOINGS IN DOWNING STREET
    </h2>
    <p>
      The dull old precincts of Downing Street were more than usually astir.
      Hackney-coaches and cabs at an early hour, private chariots somewhat
      later, went to and fro along the dreary pavement, and two cabinet
      messengers with splashed <i>calèches</i> arrived in hot haste from Dover.
      Frequent, too, were the messages from the House; a leading Oppositionist
      was then thundering away against the Government, inveighing against the
      treacherous character of their foreign policy, and indignantly calling on
      them for certain despatches to their late envoy at Naples. At every cheer
      which greeted him from his party a fresh missive would be despatched from
      the Treasury benches, and the whisper, at first cautiously muttered, grew
      louder and louder, "Why does not Upton come down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      So intricate has been the web of our petty entanglements, so complex the
      threads of those small intrigues by which we have earned our sobriquet of
      the "perfide Albion," that it is difficult at this time of day to recall
      the exact question whose solution, in the words of the orator of the
      debate, "placed us either at the head of Europe, or consigned to us the
      fatal mediocrity of a third-rate power." The prophecy, whichever way read,
      gives us unhappily no clew to the matter in hand, and we are only left to
      conjecture that it was an intervention in Spain, or "something about the
      Poles." As is usual in such cases, the matter, insignificant enough in
      itself, was converted into a serious attack on the Government, and all the
      strength of the Opposition was arrayed to give power and consistency to
      the assault. As is equally usual, the cabinet was totally unprepared for
      defence; either they had altogether undervalued the subject, or they
      trusted to the secrecy with which they had conducted it; whichever of
      these be the right explanation, each minister could only say to his
      colleague, "It never came before <i>me</i>; Upton knows all about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And where is Upton?&mdash;why does he not come down?"&mdash;were again
      and again reiterated; while a shower of messages and even mandates invoked
      his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last of these was a peremptory note from no less a person than the
      Premier himself, written in three very significant words, thus: "Come, or
      go;" and given to a trusty whip, the Hon. Gerald Neville, to deliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armed with this not very conciliatory document, the well-practised
      tactician drew up to the door of the Foreign Office, and demanded to see
      the Secretary of State.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give him this card and this note, sir," said he to the well-dressed and
      very placid young gentleman who acted as his private secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Horace is very poorly, sir; he is at this moment in a mineral bath;
      but as the matter you say is pressing, he will see you. Will you pass this
      way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Neville followed his guide through an infinity of passages, and at
      length reached a large folding-door, opening one side of which he was
      ushered into a spacious apartment, but so thoroughly impregnated with a
      thick and offensive vapor that he could barely perceive, through the mist,
      the bath in which Upton lay reclined, and the figure of a man, whose look
      and attitude bespoke the doctor, beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my dear fellow," sighed Upton, extending two dripping fingers in
      salutation, "you have come in at the death. This is the last of it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; don't say that," cried the other, encouragingly. "Have you had
      any sudden seizure? What is the nature of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He," said he, looking round to the doctor, "calls it 'arachnoidal
      trismus,'&mdash;a thing, he says, that they have all of them ignored for
      many a day, though Charlemagne died of it. Ah, Doctor,"&mdash;and he
      addressed a question to him in German.
    </p>
    <p>
      A growled volley of gutturals ensued, and Upton went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Charlemagne,&mdash;Melancthon had it, but lingered for years. It is
      the peculiar affection of great intellectual natures over-taxed and
      over-worked."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether there was that in the manner of the sick man that inspired hope,
      or something in the aspect of the doctor that suggested distrust, or a
      mixture of the two together, but certainly Neville rapidly rallied from
      the fears which had beset him on entering, and in a voice of a more cheery
      tone, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, Sir Horace, you 'll throw off this as you have done other
      such attacks. You have never been wanting either to your friends or
      yourself when the hour of emergency called. We are in a moment of such
      difficulty now, and you alone can rescue us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How cruel of the Duke to write me that!" sighed Upton, as he held up the
      piece of paper, from which the water had obliterated all trace of the
      words. "It was so inconsiderate,&mdash;eh, Neville?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not aware of the terms he employed," said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the very admission that Upton sought to obtain, and in a far more
      cheery voice he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I was capable of the effort,&mdash;if Doctor Geimirstad thought it
      safe for me to venture,&mdash;I could set all this to right. These people
      are all talking 'without book,' Neville,&mdash;the ever-recurring blunder
      of an Opposition when they address themselves to a foreign question: they
      go upon a newspaper paragraph, or the equally incorrect 'private
      communication from a friend.' Men in office alone can attain to truth&mdash;exact
      truth&mdash;about questions of foreign policy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The debate is taking a serious turn, however," interposed Neville. "They
      reiterate very bold assertions, which none of our people are in a position
      to contradict. Their confidence is evidently increasing with the show of
      confusion in our ranks. Something must be done to meet them, and that
      quickly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I suppose I must go," sighed Upton; and as he held out his wrist to
      have his pulse felt, he addressed a few words to the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He calls it 'a life period,' Neville. He says that he won't answer for
      the consequences."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor muttered on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He adds that the trismus may be thus converted into 'Bi-trismus.' Just
      imagine Bi-trismus!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a stretch of fancy clear and away beyond Neville's apprehension,
      and he began to feel certain misgivings about pushing a request so full of
      danger; but from this he was in a measure relieved by the tone in which
      Upton now addressed his valet with directions as to the dress he intended
      to wear. "The loose pelisse, with the astrakhan, Giuseppe, and that vest
      of <i>cramoisie</i> velvet; and if you will just glance at the newspaper,
      Neville, in the next room, I 'll come to you immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      The newspapers of the morning after this interview afford us the speediest
      mode of completing the incidents; and the concluding sentences of a
      leading article will be enough to place before our readers what ensued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was at this moment, and amidst the most enthusiastic cheers of the
      Treasury bench, that Sir Horace Upton entered the House. Leaning on the
      arm of Mr. Neville, he slowly passed up and took his accustomed place. The
      traces of severe illness in his features, and the great debility which his
      gestures displayed, gave an unusual interest to a scene already almost
      dramatic in its character. For a moment the great chief of Opposition was
      obliged to pause in his assault, to let this flood-tide of sympathy pass
      on; and when at length he did resume, it was plain to see how much the
      tone of his invective had been tempered by a respect for the actual
      feeling of the House. The necessity for this act of deference, added to
      the consciousness that he was in presence of the man whose acts he so
      strenuously denounced, were too much for the nerves of the orator, and he
      came to an abrupt conclusion, whose confused and uncertain sentences
      scarcely warranted the cheers with which his friends rallied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Horace rose at once to reply. His voice was at first so inarticulate
      that we could but catch the burden of what he said,&mdash;a request that
      the House would accord him all the indulgence which his state of debility
      and suffering called for. If the first few sentences he uttered imparted a
      painful significance to the entreaty, it very soon became apparent that he
      had no occasion to bespeak such indulgence. In a voice that gained
      strength and fulness as he proceeded, he entered upon what might be called
      a narrative of the foreign policy of the administration, clearly showing
      that their course was guided by certain great principles which dictated a
      line of action firm and undeviating; that the measures of the Government,
      however modified by passing events in Europe, had been uniformly
      consistent,&mdash;based upon the faith of treaties, but ever mindful of
      the growing requirements of the age. Through a narrative of singular
      complexity he guided himself with consummate skill, and though detailing
      events which occupied every region of the globe, neither confusion nor
      inconsistency ever marred the recital, and names and places and dates were
      quoted by him without any artificial aid to memory."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was in the polished air, and calm, dispassionate delivery of the
      speaker, something which seemed to charm the ears of those who for four
      hours before had been so mercilessly assailed by all the vituperation and
      insolence of party animosity. It was, so to say, a period of relief and
      repose, to which even antagonists were not insensible. No man ever
      understood the advantage of his gifts in this way better than Upton, nor
      ever was there one who could convert the powers which fascinated society
      into the means of controlling a popular assembly, with greater assurance
      of success. He was a man of a strictly logical mind, a close and acute
      thinker; he was of a highly imaginative temperament, rich in all the
      resources of a poetic fancy; he was thoroughly well read, and gifted with
      a ready memory; but, above all these,&mdash;transcendently above them all,&mdash;he
      was a "man of the world;" and no one, either in Parliament or out of it,
      knew so well when it was wrong to say "the right thing." But let us resume
      our quotation:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "For more than three hours did the House listen with breathless attention
      to a narrative which in no parliamentary experience has been surpassed for
      the lucid clearness of its details, the unbroken flow of its relation. The
      orator up to this time had strictly devoted himself to explanation; he now
      proceeded to what might be called reply. If the House was charmed and
      instructed before, it was now positively astonished and electrified by the
      overwhelming force of the speaker's raillery and invective. Not satisfied
      with showing the evil consequences that must ensue from any adoption of
      the measures recommended by the Opposition, he proceeded to exhibit the
      insufficiency of views always based upon false information.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'We have been taunted,' said he, 'with the charge of fomenting discords
      in foreign lands; we have been arraigned as disturbers of the world's
      peace, and called the firebrands of Europe; we are exhibited as parading
      the Continent with a more than Quixotic ardor, since we seek less the
      redress of wrong than the opportunity to display our own powers of
      interference,&mdash;that quality which the learned gentleman has
      significantly stigmatized as a spirit of meddling impertinence, offensive
      to the whole world of civilization. Let me tell him, sir, that the very
      debate of this night has elicited, and from himself too, the very outrages
      he has had the temerity to ascribe to us. His has been this indiscriminate
      ardor, his this unjudging rashness, his this meddling impertinence (I am
      but quoting, not inventing, a phrase), by which, without accurate,
      without, indeed, any, information, he has ventured to charge the
      Government with what no administration would be guilty, of&mdash;a cool
      and deliberate violation of the national law of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'He has told you, sir, that in our eagerness to distinguish ourselves as
      universal redressers of injury, we have "ferreted out"&mdash;I take his
      own polished expression&mdash;the case of an obscure boy in an obscure
      corner of Italy, converted a commonplace and very vulgar incident into a
      tale of interest, and, by a series of artful devices and insinuations
      based upon this narrative, a grave and insulting charge upon one of the
      oldest of our allies. He has alleged that throughout the whole of those
      proceedings we had not the shadow of pretence for our interference; that
      the acts imputed occurred in a land over which we had no control, and in
      the person of an individual in whom we had no interest; that this
      Sebastiano Greppi&mdash;this image boy, for so with a courteous pleasantry
      he has called him&mdash;was a Neapolitan subject, the affiliated envoy of
      I know not what number of secret societies; that his sculptural
      pretensions were but pretexts to conceal his real avocations,&mdash;the
      agency of a bloodthirsty faction; that his crime was no less than an act
      of high treason; and that Austrian gentleness and mercy were never more
      conspicuously illustrated than in the commutation of a death-sentence to
      one of perpetual imprisonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What a rude task is mine when I must say that for even one of these
      assertions there is not the slightest foundation in fact. Greppi's offence
      was not a crime against the state; as little was it committed within the
      limits of the Austrian territory. He is not the envoy, or even a member,
      of any revolutionary club; he never&mdash;I am speaking with knowledge,
      sir&mdash;he never mingled in the schemes of plotting politicians; as far
      removed is he from sympathy with such men, as, in the genius of a great
      artist, he is elevated above the humble path to which the learned
      gentleman's raillery would sentence him. For the character of "an image
      vendor," the learned gentleman must look nearer home; and, lastly, this
      youth is an Englishman, and born of a race and a blood that need feel no
      shame in comparison with any I see around me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the loud cry of 'Name, name,' which now arose, Sir Horace replied: 'If
      I do not announce the name at this moment, it is because there are
      circumstances in the history of the youth to which publicity would give
      irreparable pain. These are details which I have no right to bring under
      discussion, and which must inevitably thus become matters of town-talk. To
      any gentleman of the opposite side who may desire to verify the assertions
      I have made to the House, I would, under pledge of secrecy, reveal the
      name. I would do more; I would permit him to confide it to a select number
      of friends equally pledged with himself. This is surely enough?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      We have no occasion to continue our quotation farther, and we take up our
      history as Sir Horace, overwhelmed by the warmest praises and
      congratulations, drove off from the House to his home. Amid all the
      excitement and enthusiasm which this brilliant success produced among the
      ministerialists, there was a kind of dread lest the overtaxed powers of
      the orator should pay the heavy penalty of such an effort. They had all
      heard how he came from a sick chamber; they had all seen him, trembling,
      faint, and almost voiceless, as he stole up to his place, and they began
      to fear lest they had, in the hot zeal of party, imperilled the ablest
      chief in their ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a relief to these agonies had it been, could they have seen Upton as
      he once more gained the solitude of his chamber, where, divested of all
      the restraints of an audience, he walked leisurely up and down, smoking a
      cigar, and occasionally smiling pleasantly as some "conceit" crossed his
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had there been any one to mark him there, it is more than likely that he
      would have regarded him as a man revelling in the after-thought of a great
      success,&mdash;one who, having come gloriously through the combat, was
      triumphantly recalling to his memory every incident of the fight. How
      little had they understood Sir Horace Upton who would have read him in
      this wise! That daring and soaring nature rarely dallied in the past; even
      the present was scarcely full enough for the craving of a spirit that
      cried ever, "Forward!"
    </p>
    <p>
      What might be made of that night's success; how best it should be turned
      to account!&mdash;these were the thoughts which beset him, and many were
      the devices which his subtlety hit on to this end. There was not a goal
      his ambition could point to but which became associated with some
      deteriorating ingredient. He was tired of the Continent, he hated England,
      he shuddered at the Colonies. "India, perhaps," said he, hesitatingly,&mdash;"India,
      perhaps, might do." To continue as he was,&mdash;to remain in office, as
      having reached the topmost round of the ladder,&mdash;would have been
      insupportable indeed; and yet how, without longer service at his post,
      could any man claim a higher reward?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIV. THE SUBTLETIES OF STATECRAFT
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was not till Sir Horace had smoked his third cigar that he seated
      himself at his writing-table. He then wrote rapidly a brief note, of which
      he proceeded to make a careful copy. This he folded and placed in an
      envelope, addressing it to his Grace the Duke of Cloudeslie.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes afterwards he began to prepare for bed. The day was already
      breaking, and yet that sick man was unwearied and unwasted; not a trace of
      fatigue on features that, under the infliction of a tiresome dinner-party,
      would have seemed bereft of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tied-up knocker, the straw-strewn street, the closely drawn curtains
      announced to London the next morning that the distinguished minister was
      seriously ill; and from an early hour the tide of inquirers, in carriages
      and on foot, passed silently along that dreary way. High and mighty were
      the names inscribed in the porter's book; royal dukes had called in
      person; and never was public solicitude more widely manifested. There is
      something very flattering in the thought of a great intelligence being
      damaged and endangered in our service! With all its melancholy influences,
      there is a feeling of importance suggested by the idea that for us and our
      interests a man of commanding powers should have jeoparded his life. There
      is a very general prejudice, not alone in obtaining the best article for
      our money, but the most of it also; and this sentiment extends to the
      individuals employed in the public service; and it is doubtless a very
      consolatory reflection to the tax-paying classes that the great
      functionaries of state are not indolent recipients of princely incomes,
      but hard-worked men of office, up late and early at their duties,&mdash;prematurely
      old, and worn out before their time! Something of this same feeling
      inspires much of the sympathy displayed for a sick statesman,&mdash;a
      sentiment not altogether void of a certain misgiving that we have probably
      over-taxed the energies employed in our behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely one in a hundred of those who now called and "left their names"
      had ever seen Sir Horace Upton in their lives. Few are more removed from
      public knowledge than the men who fill even the highest places in our
      diplomacy. He was, therefore, to the mass a mere name. Since his accession
      to office little or nothing had been heard of him, and of that little, the
      greater part was made up of sneering allusions to his habits of indolence;
      impertinent hints about his caprices and his tastes. Yet now, by a grand
      effort in the "House," and a well got-up report of a dangerous illness the
      day after, was he the most marked man in all the state,&mdash;the theme of
      solicitude throughout two millions of people!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a dash of mystery, too, in the whole incident, which heightened
      its flavor for public taste; a vague, indistinct impression&mdash;it did
      not even amount to rumor&mdash;was abroad, that Sir Horace had not been
      "fairly treated" by his colleagues; either that they could, if they wished
      it, have defended the cause themselves, or that they had needlessly called
      him from a sick bed to come to the rescue, or that some subtle trap had
      been laid to ensnare him. These were vulgar beliefs, which, if they
      obtained little credence in the higher region of club-life, were
      extensively circulated, and not discredited, in less distinguished
      circles. How they ever got abroad at all; how they found their ways into
      newspaper paragraphs, terrifying timid supporters of the ministry by the
      dread prospect of a "smash," exciting the hopes of Opposition with the
      notion of a great secession, throwing broadcast before the world of
      readers every species of speculation, all kinds of combination,&mdash;who
      knows how all this happened? Who, indeed, ever knew how things a thousand
      times more secret ever got wind and became club-talk ere the actors in the
      events had finished an afternoon's canter in the Park?
    </p>
    <p>
      If, then, the world of London learned on the morning in question that Sir
      Horace Upton was very ill, it also surmised&mdash;why and wherefore it
      knows best&mdash;that the same Sir Horace was an ill-used man. Now, of all
      the objects of public sympathy and interest, next after a foreign emperor
      on a visit at Buckingham Palace, or a newly arrived hippopotamus at the
      Zoological Gardens, there is nothing your British public is so fond of as
      "an ill-used man." It is essential, however, to his great success that he
      be ill-used in high places; that his enemies and calumniators should have
      been, if not princes, at least dukes and marquises and great dignitaries
      of the state. Let him only be supposed to be martyred by these, and there
      is no saying where his popularity may be carried. A very general
      impression is current that the mass of the nation is more or less
      "ill-used,"&mdash;denied its natural claims and just rewards. To hit upon,
      therefore, a good representation of this hard usage, to find a tangible
      embodiment of this great injustice, is a discovery that is never
      unappreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
      To read his speech of the night before, and to peruse the ill-scrawled
      bulletin of his health at the hall door in the morning, made up the
      measure of his popularity, and the world exclaimed, "Think of the man they
      have treated in this fashion!" Every one framed the indictment to his own
      taste; nor was the wrong the less grievous that none could give it a name.
      Even cautious men fell into the trap, and were heard to say, "If all we
      hear be true, Upton has not been fairly treated."
    </p>
    <p>
      What an air of confirmation to all these rumors did it give, when the
      evening papers announced in the most striking type: Resignation of Sir
      Horace Upton. If the terms in which he communicated that step to the
      Premier were not before the world, the date, the very night of the debate,
      showed that the resolution had been come to suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the journals affected to be in the whole secret of the
      transaction, and only waiting the opportune moment to announce it to the
      world. The dark, mysterious paragraphs in which journalists show their
      no-meanings abounded, and menacing hints were thrown out that the country
      would no longer submit to.&mdash;Heaven knows what. There was, besides all
      this, a very considerable amount of that catechetical inquiry, which, by
      suggesting a number of improbabilities, hopes to arrive at the likely, and
      thus, by asking questions where they had a perfect confidence they would
      never be answered, they seemed to overwhelm their adversaries with shame
      and discomfiture. The great fact, however, was indisputable,&mdash;Upton
      had resigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the many who looked up at the shuttered windows of his sad-looking
      London house, this reflection occurred naturally enough,&mdash;How little
      the poor sufferer, on his sick bed, cared for the contest that raged
      around him; how far away were, in all probability, his thoughts from that
      world of striving and ambition whose waves came to his door-sills. Let us,
      in that privilege which belongs to us, take a peep within the curtained
      room, where a bright fire is blazing, and where, seated behind a screen,
      Sir Horace is now penning a note; a bland half smile rippling his features
      as some pleasant conceit has flashed across his mind. We have rarely seen
      him looking so well. The stimulating events of the last few days have done
      for him more than all the counsels of his doctors, and his eyes are
      brighter and his cheeks fuller than usual. A small miniature hangs
      suspended by a narrow ribbon round his neck, and a massive gold bracelet
      adorns one wrist,&mdash;"two souvenirs" which he stops to contemplate as
      he writes; nor is there a touch of sorrowful meaning in the glance he
      bestows upon them,&mdash;the look rather seems the self-complacent regard
      that a successful general might bestow on the decorations he had won by
      his valor. It is essentially vainglorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than once has he paused to read over the sentence he has written, and
      one may see, by the motion of his lips as he reads, how completely he has
      achieved the sentiment he would express. "Yes, charming Princess," said
      he, perusing the lines before him, "I've once more to throw myself at your
      feet, and reiterate the assurances of a devotion which has formed the
      happiness of my existence." ("That does not sound quite French, after
      all," muttered he; "better perhaps: 'has formed the religion of my
      heart.'") "I know you will reproach my precipitancy; I feel how your
      judgment, unerring as it ever is, will condemn what may seem a sudden
      ebullition of temper; but, I ask, is this amongst the catalogue of my
      weaknesses? Am I of that clay which is always fissured when heated? No. <i>You</i>
      know me better,&mdash;<i>you</i> alone of all the world have the clew to a
      heart whose affections are all your own. The few explanations of all that
      has happened must be reserved for our meeting. Of course, neither the
      newspapers nor the reviews have any conception of the truth. Four words
      will set your heart at ease, and these you must have: 'I have done
      wisely;' with that assurance you have no more to fear. I mean to leave
      this in all secrecy by the end of the week. I shall go over to Brussels,
      where you can address me under the name of Richard Bingham. I shall only
      remain there to watch events for a day or two, and thence on to Geneva.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite charmed with your account of poor Lady G&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      though, as I read, I can detect how all the fascinations you tell of were
      but reflected glories. Your view of her situation is admirable, and, by
      your skilful tactique, it is she herself that ostracizes the society that
      would only have accepted her on sufferance. How true is your remark as to
      the great question at issue,&mdash;not her guilt or innocence, but what
      danger might accrue to others from infractions that invite publicity. The
      cabinet were discussing t' other day a measure by which sales of estated
      property could be legalized without those tiresome and costly researches
      into title which, in a country where confiscations were frequent, became
      at last endless labor. Don't you think that some such measure might be
      beneficially adopted as regards female character? Could there not be
      invented a species of social guarantee which, rejecting all investigation
      into bygones after a certain limit, would confer a valid title that none
      might dispute?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lawyers tell us that no man's property would stand the test of a search
      for title. Are we quite certain how far the other sex are our betters in
      this respect; and might it not be wise to interpose a limit beyond which
      research need not proceed?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I concur in all you say about G&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;himself. He was
      always looking for better security than he needed,&mdash;a great mistake,
      whether the investment consist of our affections or our money. Physicians
      say that if any man could only see the delicate anatomy on which his life
      depends, and watch the play of those organs that sustain him, he would not
      have courage to move a step or utter a loud word. Might we not carry the
      analogy into morals, and ask, is it safe or prudent in us to investigate
      too deeply? are we wise in dissecting motives? or would it not be better
      to enjoy our moral as we do our material health, without seeking to assure
      ourselves further?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides all this, the untravelled Englishman&mdash;and such was Glencore
      when he married&mdash;never can be brought to understand the harmless
      levities of foreign life. Like a fresh-water sailor, he always fancies the
      boat is going to upset, and he throws himself out at the first 'jobble'! I
      own to you frankly, I never knew the case in question; 'how far she went,'
      is a secret to me. I might have heard the whole story. It required some
      address in me to escape it; but I do detest these narrations, where truth
      is marred by passion, and all just inferences confused and confounded with
      vague and absurd suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glencore's conduct throughout was little short of insanity; like a man
      who, hearing his banker is insecure, takes refuge in insolvency, he ruins
      himself to escape embarrassment. They tell me here that the shock has
      completely deranged his intellect, and that he lives a life of melancholy
      isolation in that old castle in Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How few men in this world can count the cost of their actions, and make
      up that simple calculation, 'How much shall I have to pay for it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take any view one pleases of the case, would it not have been better for
      him to have remained in the world and of it? Would not its pleasures, even
      its cares, have proved better 'distractions' than his own brooding
      thoughts? If a man have a secret ailment, does he parade it in public?
      Why, then, this exposure of a pain for which there is no sympathy?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life, after all, is only a system of compensations. Wish it to be
      whatever you please, but accept it as it really is, and make the best of
      it! For my own part, I have ever felt like one who, having got a most
      disastrous account of a road he was about to travel, is delightfully
      surprised to find the way better and the inns more comfortable than he
      looked for. In the main, men and women are very good; our mistake is,
      expecting to find people always in our own humor. Now, if one is very
      rich, this is practical enough; but the mass must be content to encounter
      disparity of mood and difference of taste at every step. There is,
      therefore, some tact required in conforming to these 'irregularities,' and
      unhappily everybody has not got tact.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, charming Princess, have tact; but you have beauty, wit, fascination,
      rank,&mdash;all that can grace high station, and all that high station can
      reflect upon great natural gifts; that <i>you</i> should see the world
      through a rose-tinted medium is a very condition of your identity; and
      there is truth, as well as good philosophy, in this view! You have often
      told me that if people were not exactly all that strict moralists might
      wish, yet that they made up a society very pleasant and livable withal,
      and that there was also a floating capital of kindness and good feeling
      quite sufficient to trade upon, and even grow richer by negotiating!
    </p>
    <p>
      "People who live out of the world, or, what comes to the same thing, in a
      little world of their own, are ever craving after perfectibility,&mdash;just
      as, in time of peace, nations only accept in their armies six-foot
      grenadiers and gigantic dragoons. Let the pressure of war or emergency
      arise, however, or, in other words, let there be the real business of life
      to be done, then the standard is lowered at once, and the battle is sought
      and won by very inferior agency. Now, show troops and show qualities are
      very much alike; they are a measure of what would be very charming to
      arrive at, were it only practicable! Oh that poor Glencore had only
      learned this lesson, instead of writing nonsense verses at Eton!
    </p>
    <p>
      "The murky domesticities of England have no correlatives in the sunny
      enjoyments of Italian life; and John Bull has got a fancy that virtue is
      only cultivated where there are coal fires, stuff curtains, and a window
      tax. Why, then, in the name of Doctors' Commons, does he marry a
      foreigner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Upton had written these words, his servant presented him with a
      visiting-card.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord Glencore!" exclaimed he, aloud. "When was he here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His Lordship is below stairs now, sir. He said he was sure you'd see
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course; show him up at once. Wait a moment; give me that cane, place
      those cushions for my feet, draw the curtain, and leave the aconite and
      ether drops near me,&mdash;that will do, thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Some minutes elapsed ere the door was opened; the slow footfall of one
      ascending the stairs, step by step, was heard, accompanied by the labored
      respiration of a man breathing heavily; and then Lord Glencore entered,
      his form worn and emaciated, and his face pale and colorless. With a
      feeble, uncertain voice, he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew you 'd see me, Upton, and I would n't go away!" And with this he
      sank into a chair and sighed deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, my dear Glencore, you knew it," said the other, feelingly, for
      he was shocked by the wretched spectacle before him; "even were I more
      seriously indisposed than&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And were you really ill, Upton?" asked Glencore, with a weakly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you ask the question? Have you not seen the evening papers, read the
      announcement on my door, seen the troops of inquirers in the streets?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," sighed he, wearily, "I have heard and seen all you say; and yet I
      bethought me of a remark I once heard from the Duke of Orleans: 'Monsieur
      Upton is a most active minister when his health permits; and when it does
      not, he is the most mischievous intriguant in Europe.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was always straining at an antithesis; he fancied he could talk like
      St. Simon, and it really spoiled a very pleasant converser."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so you have been very ill?" said Glencore, slowly, and as though he
      had not heeded the last remark; "so have I also!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to me too feeble to be about, Glencore," said Upton, kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so, if it were of any consequence,&mdash;I mean, if my life could
      interest or benefit any one. My head, however, will bear solitude no
      longer; I must have some one to talk to. I mean to travel; I will leave
      this in a day or so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along with me, then; my plan is to make for Brussels, but it must
      not be spoken of, as I want to watch events there before I remove farther
      from England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is all true, then,&mdash;you have resigned?" said Glencore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a strange step to take! I remember, more than twenty years ago, your
      telling me that you'd rather be Foreign Secretary of England than the
      monarch of any third-rate Continental kingdom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought so then, and, what is more singular, I think so still."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you throw it up at the very moment people are proclaiming your
      success!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall hear all my reasons, Glencore, for this resolution, and will, I
      feel assured, approve of them; but they 'd only weary you now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me know them now, Upton; it is such a relief to me when, even by a
      momentary interest in anything, I am able to withdraw this poor tired
      brain from its own distressing thoughts." He spoke these words not only
      with strong feeling, but even imparted to them a tone of entreaty, so that
      Upton could not but comply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I wished for the Secretaryship, my dear Glencore," said he, "I
      fancied the office as it used to be in olden times, when one played the
      great game of diplomacy with kings and ministers for antagonists, and the
      world at large for spectators; when consummate skill and perfect secrecy
      were objects of moment, and when grand combinations rewarded one's labor
      with all the certainty of a mathematical problem. Every move on the board
      could be calculated beforehand, no disturbing influences could derange
      plans that never were divulged till they were accomplished. All that is
      past and gone; our Constitution, grown every day more and more democratic,
      rules by the House of Commons. Questions whose treatment demands all the
      skill of a statesman and all the address of a man of the world come to be
      discussed in open Parliament; correspondence is called for, despatches and
      even private notes are produced; and while the State you are opposed to
      revels in the security of secrecy, <i>your</i> whole game is revealed to
      the world in the shape of a blue-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor is this all: the debaters on these nice and intricate questions,
      involving the most far-reaching speculation of statesmanship, are men of
      trade and enterprise, who view every international difficulty only in its
      relation to their peculiar interests. National greatness, honor, and
      security are nothing,&mdash;the maintenance of that equipoise which
      preserves peace is nothing,&mdash;the nice management which, by the
      exhibition of courtesy here, or of force there, is nothing compared to
      alliances that secure us ample supplies of raw material, and abundant
      markets for manufactures. Diplomacy has come to this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you must have known all this before you accepted office; you had seen
      where the course of events led to, and were aware that the House ruled the
      country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I did not recognize the fact to its full extent. Perhaps I
      fancied I could succeed in modifying the system," said Upton, cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A hopeless undertaking!" said Glencore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not quite so certain of that," said Upton, pausing for a while as he
      seemed to reflect. When he resumed, it was in a lighter and more flippant
      tone: "To make short of it, I saw that I could not keep office on these
      conditions, but I did not choose to go out as a beaten man. For my pride's
      sake I desired that my reasons should be reserved for myself alone; for my
      actual benefit it was necessary that I should have a hold over my
      colleagues in office. These two conditions were rather difficult to
      combine, but I accomplished them.

      "I had interested the King so much in my views as to what the Foreign
      Office ought to be that an interchange of letters took place, and his
      Majesty imparted to me his fullest confidence in disparagement of the
      present system. This correspondence was a perfect secret to the whole
      Cabinet; but when it had arrived at a most confidential crisis, I
      suggested to the King that Cloudeslie should be consulted. I knew well
      that this would set the match to the train. No sooner did Cloudeslie learn
      that such a correspondence had been carried on for months without his
      knowledge, views stated, plans promulgated, and the King's pleasure taken
      on questions not one of which should have been broached without his
      approval and concurrence, than he declared he would not hold the seals of
      office another hour. The King, well knowing his temper, and aware what a
      terrific exposure might come of it, sent for me, and asked what was to be
      done. I immediately suggested my own resignation as a sacrifice to the
      difficulty and to the wounded feelings of the Duke. Thus did I achieve
      what I sought for. I imposed a heavy obligation on the King and the
      Premier, and I have secured secrecy as to my motives, which none will ever
      betray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only remained for the debate of the other night, for I wanted a little
      public enthusiasm to mark the fall of the curtain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that you still hold them as your debtors?" asked Glencore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without doubt, I do; my claim is a heavy one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what would satisfy it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If my health would stand England," said Upton, leisurely, "I'd take a
      peerage; but as this murky atmosphere would suffocate me, and as I don't
      care for the latter without the political privileges, I have determined to
      have the 'Garter.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Garter! a blue ribbon!" exclaimed Glencore, as though the
      insufferable coolness with which the pretension was announced might
      justify any show of astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I had some thoughts of India, but the journey deters me,&mdash;in
      fact, as I have enough to live on, I 'd rather devote the remainder of my
      days to rest, and the care of this shattered constitution." It is
      impossible to convey to the reader the tender and affectionate compassion
      with which Sir Horace seemed to address these last words to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you ever look upon yourself as the luckiest fellow in Europe, Upton?"
      asked Glencore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," sighed he; "I occasionally fancy I have been hardly dealt with by
      fortune. I have only to throw my eyes around me, and see a score of men,
      richer and more elevated than myself, not one of whom has capacity for
      even a third-rate task, so that really the self-congratulation you speak
      of has not occurred to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, after all, you have had a most successful career&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at the matter this way, Glencore; there are about six&mdash;say six
      men in all Europe&mdash;who have a little more common sense than all the
      rest of the world: I could tell you the names of five of them." If there
      was a supreme boastfulness in the speech, the modest delivery of it
      completely mystified the hearer, and he sat gazing with wonderment at the
      man before him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLV. SOME SAD REVERIES
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Have you any plans, Glencore?" asked Upton, as they posted along towards
      Dover.
    </p>
    <p>
      "None," was the brief reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor any destination you desire to reach?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a state as yours, then, I take it, is about the best thing going in
      life. Every move one makes is attended with so many adverse
      considerations,&mdash;every goal so separated from us by unforeseen
      difficulties,&mdash;that an existence, even without what is called an
      object, has certain great advantages."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am curious to hear them," said the other, half cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For myself," said Upton, not accepting the challenge, "the brief
      intervals of comparative happiness I have enjoyed have been in periods
      when complete repose, almost torpor, has surrounded me, and when the mere
      existence of the day has engaged my thoughts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What became of memory all this while?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Memory!" said Upton, laughing, "I hold my memory in proper subjection. It
      no more dares obtrude upon me uncalled for than would my valet come into
      my room till I ring for him. Of the slavery men endure from their own
      faculties I have no experience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, of course, no sympathy for them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not say that I cannot compassionate sufferings, though I have not
      felt them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you quite sure of that?" asked Glencore, almost sternly; "is not your
      very pity a kind of contemptuous sentiment towards those who sorrow
      without reason,&mdash;the strong man's estimate of the weak man's
      sufferings? Believe me, there is no true condolence where there is not the
      same experience of woe!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should be sorry to lay down so narrow a limit to fellow-feeling," said
      Upton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You told me a few moments back," said Glencore, "that your memory was
      your slave. How, then, can you feel for one like me, whose memory is his
      master? How understand a path that never wanders out of the shadow of the
      past?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was such an accent of sorrow impressed upon these words that Upton
      did not desire to prolong a discussion so painful; and thus, for the
      remainder of the way, little was interchanged between them. They crossed
      the strait by night, and as Upton stole upon deck after dusk, he found
      Glencore seated near the wheel, gazing intently at the lights on shore,
      from which they were fast receding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am taking my last look at England, Upton," said he, affecting a tone of
      easy indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You surely mean to go back again one of these days?" said Upton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, never!" said he, solemnly. "I have made all my arrangements for
      the future,&mdash;every disposition regarding my property; I have
      neglected nothing, so far as I know, of those claims which, in the shape
      of relationship, the world has such reverence for; and now I bethink me of
      myself. I shall have to consult you, however, about this boy," said he,
      faltering in the words. "The objection I once entertained to his bearing
      my name exists no longer; he may call himself Massy, if he will. The
      chances are," added he, in a lower and more feeling voice, "that he
      rejects a name that will only remind him of a wrong!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Glencore," said Upton, with real tenderness, "do I apprehend you
      aright? Are you at last convinced that you have been unjust? Has the
      moment come in which your better judgment rises above the evil counsels of
      prejudice and passion&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean, am I assured of her innocence?" broke in Glencore, wildly.
      "Do you imagine, if I were so, that I could withhold my hand from taking a
      life so infamous and dishonored as mine? The world would have no parallel
      for such a wretch! Mark me, Upton!" cried he, fiercely, "there is no
      torture I have yet endured would equal the bare possibility of what you
      hint at."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens! Glencore, do not let me suppose that selfishness has so
      marred and disfigured your nature that this is true. Bethink you of what
      you say. Would it not be the crowning glory of your life to repair a
      dreadful wrong, and acknowledge before the world that the fame you had
      aspersed was without stain or spot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And with what grace should I ask the world to believe me? Is it when
      expiating the shame of a falsehood that I should call upon men to accept
      me as truthful? Have I not proclaimed her, from one end of Europe to the
      other, dishonored? If <i>she</i> be absolved, what becomes of <i>me?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is unworthy of you, Glencore," said Upton, severely; "nor, if
      illness and long suffering had not impaired your judgment, had you ever
      spoken such words. I say once more, that if the day came that you could
      declare to the world that her fame had no other reproach than the
      injustice of your own unfounded jealousy, that day would be the best and
      the proudest of your life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The proud day that published me a calumniator of all that I was most
      pledged to defend,&mdash;the deliberate liar against the obligation of the
      holiest of all contracts! You forget, Upton,&mdash;but I do not forget,&mdash;that
      it was by this very argument you once tried to dissuade me from my act of
      vengeance. You told me&mdash;ay, in words that still ring in my ears&mdash;to
      remember that if by any accident or chance her innocence might be proven,
      I could never avail myself of the indication without first declaring my
      own unworthiness to profit by it; that if the Wife stood forth in all the
      pride of purity, the Husband would be a scoff and a shame throughout the
      world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I said so," said Upton, "it was to turn you from a path that could
      not but lead to ruin; I endeavored to deter you by an appeal that
      interested even your selfishness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your subtlety has outwitted itself, Upton," said Glencore, with a bitter
      irony; "it is not the first instance on record where blank cartridge has
      proved fatal!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One thing is perfectly clear," said Upton, boldly, "the man who shrinks
      from the repair of a wrong he has done, on the consideration of how it
      would affect himself and his own interests, shows that he cares more for
      the outward show of honor than its real and sustaining power."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And will you tell me, Upton, that the world's estimate of a man's fame is
      not essential to his self-esteem, or that there yet lived one, who would
      brave obloquy without, by the force of something within him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This I will tell you," replied Upton, "that he who balances between the
      two is scarcely an honest man, and that he who accepts the show for the
      substance is not a wise one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These are marvellous sentiments to hear from one whose craft has risen to
      a proverb, and whose address in life is believed to be not his meanest
      gift."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I accept the irony in all good humor; I go farther, Glencore, I stoop to
      explain. When any one in the great and eventful journey of life seeks to
      guide himself safely, he has to weigh all the considerations, and
      calculate all the combinations adverse to him. The straight road is
      rarely, or never, possible; even if events were, which they are not, easy
      to read, they must be taken in combination with others, and with their
      consequences. The path of action becomes necessarily devious and winding,
      and compromises are called for at every step. It is not in the moment of
      shipwreck that a man stops to inquire into petty details of the articles
      he throws into a long-boat; he is bent on saving himself as best he can.
      He seizes what is next to him, if it suit his purpose. Now, were he to act
      in this manner in all the quiet security of his life on shore, his conduct
      would be highly blamable. No emergency would warrant his taking what
      belonged to another,&mdash;no critical moment would drive him to the
      instinct of self-preservation. Just the same is the interval between
      action and reflection. Give me time and forethought, and I will employ
      something better and higher than craft. My subtlety, as you like to call
      it, is not my best weapon; I only use it in emergency."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I read the matter differently," said Glencore, sulkily; "I could,
      perhaps, offer another explanation of your practice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray let me hear it; we are all in confidence here, and I promise you I
      will not take badly whatever you say to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore sat silent and motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, shall I say it for you, Glencore? for I think I know what is
      passing in your mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other nodded, and he went on,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would tell me, in plain words, that I keep my craft for myself; my
      high principle for my friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore only smiled, but Upton continued,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, then, I have guessed aright; and the very worst you can allege
      against this course is, that what I bestow is better than what I retain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of Solomon's proverbs may be better than a shilling; but which would
      a hungry man rather have? I want no word-fencing, Upton; still less do I
      seek what might sow distrust between us. This much, however, has life
      taught me: the great trials of this world are like its great maladies.
      Providence has meant them to be fatal. We call in the doctor in the one
      case, or the counsellor in the other, out of habit rather than out of
      hope. Our own consciousness has already whispered that nothing can be of
      use; but we like to do as our neighbors, and so we take remedies and
      follow injunctions to the last. The wise man quickly detects by the
      character of the means how emergent is the case believed to be, and
      rightly judges that recourse to violent measures implies the presence of
      great peril. If he be really wise, then he desists at once from what can
      only torture his few remaining hours. They can be given to better things
      than the agonies of such agency. To this exact point has my case come, and
      by the counsels you have given me do I read my danger! Your only remedy is
      as bad as the malady it is meant to cure! I cannot take it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Accepting your own imagery, I would say," said Upton, "that you are one
      who will not submit to an operation of some pain that he might be cured."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore sat moodily for some moments without speaking; at last he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel as though continual change of place and scene would be a relief to
      me. Let us rendezvous, therefore, somewhere for the autumn, and meanwhile
      I 'll wander about alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What direction do you purpose to take?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Schwarzwald and the Hohlenthal, first. I want to revisit a place I
      knew in happier days. Memory must surely have something besides sorrows to
      render us. I owned a little cottage there once, near Steig. I fished and
      read Uhland for a summer long. I wonder if I could resume the same life. I
      knew the whole village,&mdash;the blacksmith, the schoolmaster, the
      Dorfrichter,&mdash;all of them. Good, kind souls they were: how they wept
      when we parted! Nothing consoled them but my having purchased the cottage,
      and promised to come back again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Upton was glad to accept even this much of interest in the events of life,
      and drew Glencore on to talk of the days he had passed in this solitary
      region.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in the dreariest landscape a ray of sunlight will reveal some beautiful
      effects, making the eddies of the dark pool to glitter, lighting up the
      russet moss, and giving to the half-dried lichen a tinge of bright color,
      so will, occasionally, memory throw over a life of sorrow a gleam of
      happier meaning. Faces and events, forms and accents, that once found the
      way to our hearts, come back again, faintly and imperfectly it may be, but
      with a touch that revives in us what we once were. It is the one sole
      feature in which self-love becomes amiable, when, looking back on our
      past, we cherish the thought of a time before the world had made us
      sceptical and hard-hearted!
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore warmed as he told of that tranquil period when poetry gave a
      color to his life, and the wild conceptions of genius ran like a thread of
      gold through the whole web of existence. He quoted passages that had
      struck him for their beauty or their truthfulness; he told how he had
      tried to allure his own mind to the tone that vibrated in "the magic music
      of verse," and how the very attempt had inspired him with gentler
      thoughts, a softer charity, and a more tender benevolence towards his
      fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tieck is right, Upton, when he says there are two natures in us, distinct
      and apart: one, the imaginative and ideal; the other, the actual and the
      sensual. Many shake them together and confound them, making of the
      incongruous mixture that vile compound of inconsistency where the
      beautiful and the true are ever warring with the deformed and the false;
      their lives a long struggle with themselves, a perpetual contest between
      high hope and base enjoyment. A few keep them apart, retaining, through
      their worldliness, some hallowed spot in the heart, where ignoble desires
      and mean aspirations have never dared to come. A fewer still have made the
      active work of life subordinate to the guiding spirit of purity,
      adventuring on no road unsanctioned by high and holy thoughts, caring for
      no ambitions but such as make us nobler and better.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I once had a thought of such a life; and even the memory of it, like the
      prayers we have learned in our childhood, has a hallowing influence over
      after years. If that poor boy, Upton," and his lips trembled on the words,&mdash;"if
      that poor boy could have been brought up thus humbly! If he had been
      taught to know no more than an existence of such simplicity called for,
      what a load of care might it have spared <i>his</i> heart and <i>mine!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have read over those letters I gave you about him?" asked Upton, who
      eagerly availed himself of the opportunity to approach an almost forbidden
      theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have read them over and over," said Glencore, sadly; "in all the
      mention of him I read the faults of my own nature,&mdash;a stubborn spirit
      of pride that hardens as much as elevates; a resentful temper, too prone
      to give way to its own impulses; an over-confidence in himself, too,
      always ready to revenge its defeats on the world about him. These are his
      defects, and they are mine. Poor fellow, that he should inherit all that I
      have of bad, and yet not be heir to the accidents of fortune which make
      others so lenient to faults!"
    </p>
    <p>
      If Upton heard these words with much interest, no less was he struck by
      the fact that Glencore made no inquiry whatever as to the youth's fate.
      The last letter of the packet revealed the story of an eventful duel and
      the boy's escape from Massa by night, with his subsequent arrest by the
      police; and yet in the face of incidents like these he continued to
      speculate on traits of mind and character, nor even adverted to the more
      closely touching events of his fate. By many an artful hint and ingenious
      device did Sir Horace try to tempt him to some show of curiosity; but all
      were fruitless. Glencore would talk freely and willingly of the boy's
      disposition and his capacity; he would even speculate on the successes and
      failures such a temperament might meet with in life; but still he spoke as
      men might speak of a character in a fiction, ingeniously weighing
      casualties and discussing chances; never, even by accident, approaching
      the actual story of his life, or seeming to attach any interest to his
      destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upton's shrewd intelligence quickly told him that this reserve was not
      accidental; and he deliberated within himself how far it was safe to
      invade it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he resumed the attempt by adroitly alluding to the spirited
      resistance the boy had made to his capture, and the consequences one might
      naturally enough ascribe to a proud and high-hearted youth thus
      tyrannically punished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have heard something," said Upton, "of the severities practised at
      Kuffstein, and they recall the horrible tales of the Inquisition; the
      terrible contrivances to extort confessions,&mdash;expedients that often
      break down the intellect whose secrets they would discover; so that one
      actually shudders at the name of a spot so associated with evil."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore placed his hands over his face, but did not utter a word; and
      again Upton went on urging, by every device he could think of, some
      indication that might mean interest, if not anxiety, when suddenly he felt
      Glencore's hand grasp his arm with violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more of this, Upton," cried he, sternly; "you do not know the torture
      you are giving me." There was a long and painful pause between them, at
      the end of which Glencore spoke, but it was in a voice scarcely above a
      whisper, and every accent of which trembled with emotion. "You remember
      one sad and memorable night, Upton, in that old castle in Ireland,&mdash;the
      night when I came to the resolution of this vengeance! I sent for the boy
      to my room; we were alone there together, face to face. It was such a
      scene as could brook no witness, nor dare I now recall its details as they
      occurred. He came in frankly and boldly, as he felt he had a right to do.
      How he left that room,&mdash;cowed, abashed, and degraded,&mdash;I have
      yet before me. Our meeting did not exceed many minutes in duration;
      neither of us could have endured it longer. Brief as it was, we ratified a
      compact between us: it was this,&mdash;neither was ever to question or
      inquire after the other, as no tie should unite, no interest should bind
      us. Had you seen him then, Upton," cried Glencore, wildly, "the proud
      disdain with which he listened to my attempts at excuse, the haughty
      distance with which he seemed to reject every thought of complaint, the
      stern coldness with which he heard me plan out his future,&mdash;you would
      have said that some curse had fallen upon my heart, or it could never have
      been dead to traits which proclaimed him to be my own. In that moment it
      was my lot to be like him who held out his own right hand to be first
      burned, ere he gave his body to the flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We parted without an embrace; not even a farewell was spoken between us.
      While I gloried in his pride, had he but yielded ever so little, had one
      syllable of weakness, one tear escaped him, I had given up my project,
      reversed all my planned vengeance, and taken him to my heart as my own.
      But no! He was resolved on proving by his nature that he was of that stern
      race from which, by a falsehood, I was about to exclude him. It was as
      though my own blood hurled a proud defiance to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As he walked slowly to the door, his glove fell from his hand. I
      stealthily caught it up. I wanted to keep it as a memorial of that bitter
      hour; but he turned hastily around and plucked it from my hand. The action
      was even a rude one; and with a mocking smile, as though he read my
      meaning and despised it, he departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You now have heard the last secret of my heart in this sad history. Let
      us speak of it no more." And with this, Glencore arose and left the deck.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVI. THE FLOOD IN THE MAGRA
    </h2>
    <p>
      When it rains in Italy it does so with a passionate ardor that bespeaks an
      unusual pleasure. It is no "soft dissolving in tears," but a perfect
      outburst of woe,&mdash;wailing in accents the very wildest, and deluging
      the land in torrents. Mountain streams that were rivulets in the morning,
      before noon arrives are great rivers, swollen and turbid, carrying away
      massive rocks from their foundations, and tearing up large trees by the
      roots. The dried-up stony bed you have crossed a couple of hours back with
      unwetted feet is now the course of a stream that would defy the boldest.
    </p>
    <p>
      These sudden changes are remarkably frequent along that beautiful tract
      between Nice and Massa, and which is known as the "Riviera di Levante."
      The rivers, fed from innumerable streams that pour down from the
      Apennines, are almost instantaneously swollen; and as their bed
      continually slopes towards the sea, the course of the waters is one of
      headlong velocity. Of these, the most dangerous by far is the Magra. The
      river, which even in dry seasons is a considerable stream, becomes, when
      fed by its tributaries, a very formidable body of water, stretching full a
      mile in width, and occasionally spreading a vast sheet of foam close to
      the very outskirts of Sarzana. The passage of the river is all the more
      dangerous at these periods as it approaches the sea, and more than one
      instance is recorded where the stout raft, devoted to the use of
      travellers, has been carried away to the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the great post-road from Genoa to the South passes, a miserable
      shealing stands, half hidden in tall osiers, and surrounded with a sedgy,
      swampy soil the foot sinks in at every step. This is the shelter of the
      boatmen who navigate the raft, and who, in relays by day and night, are in
      waiting for the service of travellers. In the dreary days of winter, or in
      the drearier nights, it is scarcely possible to imagine a more hopeless
      spot; deep in the midst of a low marshy tract, the especial home of
      tertian fever, with the wild stream roaring at the very door-sill, and the
      thunder of the angry ocean near, it is indeed all that one can picture of
      desolation and wretchedness. Nor do the living features of the scene
      relieve its gloomy influence. Though strong men, and many of them in the
      prime of life, premature age and decay seem to have settled down upon
      them. Their lustreless eyes and leaden lips tell of ague, and their sad,
      thoughtful faces bespeak those who are often called upon to meet peril,
      and who are destined to lives of emergency and hazard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the low and miserable hut we speak of, just as night set in of a
      raw November, that four of these raftsmen sat at their smoky fire, in
      company with two travellers on foot, whose humble means compelled them to
      await the arrival of some one rich enough to hire the raft. Meanly clad
      and wayworn were the strangers who now sat endeavoring to dry their
      dripping clothes at the blaze, and conversing in a low tone together. If
      the elder, dressed in a russet-colored blouse and a broad-leafed hat, his
      face almost hid in beard and moustaches, seemed by his short and almost
      grotesque figure a travelling showman, the appearance of the younger,
      despite all the poverty of his dress, implied a very different class.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was tall and well knit, with a loose activity in all his gestures which
      almost invariably characterizes the Englishman; and though his dark hair
      and his bronzed cheek gave him something of a foreign look, there was a
      calm, cold self-possession in his air that denoted the Anglo-Saxon. He sat
      smoking his cigar, his head resting on one hand, and evidently listening
      with attention to the words of his companion. The conversation that passed
      will save us the trouble of introducing them to our reader, if he have not
      already guessed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we don't wait," said the elder, "till somebody richer and better off
      than ourselves comes, we 'll have to pay seven francs for passin' in such
      a night as this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a downright robbery to ask so much," cried the other, angrily.
      "What so great danger is there, or what so great hardship, after all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is both one and the other, I believe," replied he, in a tone
      evidently meant to moderate his passion; "and just look at the poor
      craytures that has to do it. They're as weak as a bit of wet paper; they
      haven't strength to make themselves heard when they talk out there beside
      the river."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fellow yonder," said the youth, "has got good brawny arms and sinewy
      legs of his own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, and he is starved after all. A cut of rye bread and an onion won't
      keep the heart up, nor a jug of red vinegar, though ye call it
      grape-juice. On my conscience, I 'm thinkin' that the only people that
      preserves their strength upon nothin' is the Irish. I used to carry the
      bags over Slieb-na-boregan mountain and the Turk's Causeway on wet
      potatoes and buttermilk, and never a day late for eleven years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a life!" cried the youth, in an accent of utter pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix, it was an elegant life,&mdash;that is, when the weather was anyways
      good. With a bright sun shinin' and a fine fresh breeze blowin' the white
      clouds away over the Atlantic, my road was a right cheery one, and I went
      along inventin' stories, sometimes fairy tales, sometimes makin' rhymes to
      myself, but always happy and contented. There wasn't a bit of the way I
      had n't a name for in my own mind, either some place I read about, or some
      scene in a story of my own; but better than all, there was a dog,&mdash;a
      poor starved lurcher he was,&mdash;with a bit of the tail cut off; he used
      to meet me, as regular as the clock, on the side of Currah-na-geelah, and
      come beside me down to the ford every day in the year. No temptation nor
      flattery would bring him a step farther. I spent three-quarters of an hour
      once trying it, but to no good; he took leave of me on the bank of the
      river, and went away back with his head down, as if he was grievin' over
      something. Was n't that mighty curious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps, like ourselves, Billy, he wasn't quite sure of his passport,"
      said the other, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix, may be so," replied he, with perfect seriousness. "My notion was
      that he was a kind of an outlaw, a chap that maybe bit a child of the
      family, or ate a lamb of a flock given him to guard. But indeed his
      general appearance and behavior was n't like that; he had good manners,
      and, starved as he was, he never snapped the bread out of my fingers, but
      took it gently, though his eyes was dartin' out of his head with eagerness
      all the while."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A great test of good breeding, truly," said the youth, sadly. "It must be
      more than a mere varnish when it stands the hard rubs of life in this
      wise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis the very notion occurred to myself. It was the dhrop of good blood
      in him made him what he was."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stealthy and fleeting as was the look that accompanied these words, the
      youth saw it, and blushed to the very top of his forehead. "The night
      grows milder," said he, to relieve the awkwardness of the moment by any
      remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a mighty grand sight out there now," replied the other; "there's
      three miles if there's an inch of white foam dashing down to the sea, that
      breaks over the bar with a crash like thunder; big trees are sweepin'
      past, and pieces of vine trellises, and a bit of a mill-wheel, all carried
      off just like twigs on a stream."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would money tempt those fellows, I wonder, to venture out on such a night
      as this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure; and why not? The daily fight poverty maintains with existence
      dulls the sense of every danger but what comes of want. Don't I know it
      myself? The poor man has no inimy but hunger; for, ye see, the other
      vexations and troubles of life, there's always a way of gettin' round
      them. You can chate even grief, and you can slip away from danger; but
      there's no circumventin' an empty stomach."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a tyrant is then your rich man!" sighed the youth, heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That he is. 'Dives honoratus. Pulcher rex denique regum.' You may do as
      you please if ye'r rich as a Begum."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A free translation, rather, Billy," said the other, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or ye might render it this way," said Billy,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "If ye 've money enough and to spare in the bank,
     The world will give ye both beauty and rank.
</pre>
    <p>
      And I 've nothing to say agin it," continued he. "The raal stimulus to
      industhry in life, is to make wealth powerful. Gettin' and heapin' up
      money for money's sake is a debasin' kind of thing; but makin' a fortune,
      in order that you may extind your influence, and mowld the distinies of
      others,&mdash;that's grand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And see what comes of it!" cried the youth, bitterly. "Mark the base and
      unworthy subserviency it leads to; see the race of sycophants it begets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have you there, too," cried Billy, with all the exultation of a ready
      debater. "Them dirty varmint ye speak of is the very test of the truth I
      'm tellin' ye. 'T is because they won't labor&mdash;because they won't
      work&mdash;that they are driven to acts of sycophancy and meanness. The
      spirit of industhry saves a man even the excuse of doin' anything low!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how often, from your own lips, have I listened to praises at your
      poor humble condition; rejoicings that your lot in life secured you
      against the cares of wealth and grandeur!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you will again, plaze God! if <i>I</i> live, and <i>you</i> pre-sarve
      your hearin'. What would I be if I was rich, but an ould&mdash;an ould
      voluptuary?" said Billy, with great emphasis on a word he had some trouble
      in discovering. "Atin' myself sick with delicacies, and drinkin' cordials
      all day long. How would I know the uses of wealth? Like all other vulgar
      creatures, I 'd be buyin' with my money the respect that I ought to be
      buyin' with my qualities. It's the very same thing you see in a fair or a
      market,&mdash;the country girls goin' about, hobbled and crippled with
      shoes on, that, if they had bare feet, could walk as straight as a rush.
      Poverty is not ungraceful itself. It's tryin' to be what isn't natural,
      spoils people entirely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I hear voices without. Listen!" cried the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It 's only the river; it's risin' every minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, that was a shout. I heard it distinctly. Ay, the boatmen hear it
      now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a travelling-carriage. I see the lamps," cried one of the men, as
      he stood at the door and looked landward. "They may as well keep the road;
      there's no crossing the Magra to-night!"
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the postilions' whips commenced that chorus of cracking by
      which they are accustomed to announce all arrivals of importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell them to go back, Beppo," said the chief of the raftsmen to one of
      his party. "If we might try to cross with the mail-bags in a boat, there's
      not one of us would attempt the passage on the raft."
    </p>
    <p>
      To judge from the increased noise and uproar, the travellers' impatience
      had now reached its highest point; but to this a slight lull succeeded,
      probably occasioned by the parley with the boatman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They'll give us five Napoleons for the job," said Beppo, entering, and
      addressing his Chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Per Dio</i>, that won't support our families if we leave them
      fatherless," muttered the other. "Who and what are they that can't wait
      till morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who knows?" said Beppo, with a genuine shrug of native indifference.
      "Princes, belike!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Princes or beggars, we all have lives to save!" mumbled out an old man,
      as he reseated himself by the fire. Meanwhile the courier had entered the
      hut, and was in earnest negotiation with the chief, who, however, showed
      no disposition to run the hazard of the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you all cowards alike?" said the courier, in all the insolence of his
      privileged order; "or is it a young fellow of <i>your</i> stamp that
      shrinks from the risk of a wet jacket?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This speech was addressed to the youth, whom he had mistaken for one of
      the raftsmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep your coarse speeches for those who will bear them, my good fellow,"
      said the other, boldly, "or mayhap the first wet jacket here will be one
      with gold lace on the collar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's not one of us; he's a traveller," quickly interposed the chief, who
      saw that an angry scene was brewing. "He's only waiting to cross the
      river," muttered he in a whisper, "when some one comes rich enough to hire
      the raft."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Sacre bleu!</i> Then he shan't come with us; that I'll promise him,"
      said the courier, whose offended dignity roused all his ire. "Now, once
      for all, my men, will you earn a dozen Napoleons, or not? Here they are
      for you if you land us safely at the other side; and never were you so
      well paid in your lives for an hour's labor."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of the gold, as it glistened temptingly in his outstretched
      hand, appealed to their hearts far more eloquently than all his words, and
      they gathered in a group together to hold counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you, are you also a distinguished stranger?" said the courier,
      addressing Billy, who sat warming his hands by the embers of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look you, my man," cried the youth, "all the gold in your master's
      leathern bag there can give you no claim to insult those who have offered
      you no offence. It is enough that you know that we do not belong to the
      raft to suffer us to escape your notice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Sacristi!</i>" exclaimed the courier, in a tone of insolent mockery,
      "I have travelled the road long enough to learn that one does not need an
      introduction before addressing a vagabond."
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0004" id="linkimage-0004">
      <!-- IMG --></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/glen0402.jpg" alt=" 402 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      "Vagabond!" cried the youth, furiously; and he sprang at the other with
      the bound of a tiger. The courier quickly parried the blow aimed at him,
      and, closely grappled, they both now reeled out of the hut in terrible
      conflict. With that terror of the knife that figures in all Italian
      quarrels, the boatmen did not dare to interfere, but looked on as,
      wrestling with all their might, the combatants struggled, each endeavoring
      to push the other towards the stream. Billy, too, restrained by force,
      could not come to the rescue, and could only by words, screamed out in all
      the wildness of his agony, encourage his companion. "Drop on your knee&mdash;catch
      him by the legs&mdash;throw him back&mdash;back into the stream. That's it&mdash;that's
      it! Good luck to ye!" shouted he, madly, as he fought like a lion with
      those about him. Slipping in the slimy soil, they had both now come to
      their knees; and after a struggle of some minutes' duration, rolled,
      clasped in each other's fierce embrace, down the slope into the river. A
      plash, and a cry half smothered, were heard, and all was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      While some threw themselves on the frantic creature, whose agony now
      overtopped his reason, and who fought to get free, with the furious rage
      of despair, others, seizing lanterns and torches, hurried along the bank
      of the torrent to try and rescue the combatants. A sudden winding of the
      river at the place gave little hope to the search, and it was all but
      certain that the current must already have swept them down far beyond any
      chance of succor. Assisted by the servants of the traveller, who speedily
      were apprised of the disaster, the search was continued for hours, and
      morning at length began to break over the dreary scene, without one ray of
      hope. By the gray cold dawn, the yellow flood could be seen for a
      considerable distance, and the banks too, over which a gauzy mist was
      hanging; but not a living thing was there! The wild torrent swept along
      his murky course with a deep monotonous roar. Trunks of trees and leafy
      branches rose and sank in the wavy flood, but nothing suggested the
      vaguest hope that either had escaped. The traveller's carriage returned to
      Spezia, and Billy, now bereft of reason, was conveyed to the same place,
      fast tied with cords, to restrain him from a violence that threatened his
      own life and that of any near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening of that day a peasant's car arrived at Spezia, conveying
      the almost lifeless courier, who had been found on the river's bank, near
      the mouth of the Magra. How he had reached the spot, or what had become of
      his antagonist, he knew not. Indeed, the fever which soon set in placed
      him beyond the limit of all questioning, and his incoherent cries and
      ravings only betrayed the terrible agonies his mind must have passed
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this tragic incident, heightened by the actual presence of two of the
      actors&mdash;one all but dead, the other dying&mdash;engaged the entire
      interest and sympathy of the little town, the authorities were actively
      employed in investigating the event, and ascertaining, so far as they
      could, to which side the chief blame inclined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The raftsmen had all been arrested, and were examined carefully, one by
      one; and now it only remained to obtain from the traveller himself
      whatever information he could contribute to throw light on the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      His passport, showing that he was an English peer, obtained for him all
      the deference and respect foreign officials are accustomed to render to
      that title, and the Prefect announced that if it suited his convenience,
      he would wait on his Lordship at his hotel to receive his deposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have nothing to depose, no information to give," was the dry and not
      over-courteous response; but as the visit, it was intimated, was
      indispensable, he named his hour to admit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bland and polite tone of the Prefect was met by a manner of cold but
      well-bred ease which seemed to imply that the traveller only regarded the
      incident in the light of an unpleasant interruption to his journey, but in
      which he took no other interest. Even the hints thrown out that he ought
      to consider himself aggrieved and his dignity insulted, produced no effect
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was my intention to have halted a few days at Massa, and I could have
      obtained another courier in the interval," was the cool commentary he
      bestowed on the incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But your Lordship would surely desire investigation. A man is missing; a
      great crime may have been committed&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse my interrupting; but as I am not, nor can be supposed to be, the
      criminal,&mdash;nor do I feel myself the victim,&mdash;while I have not a
      claim to the character of witness, you would only harass me with
      interrogatories I could not answer, and excite me to take interest, or at
      least bestow attention, on what cannot concern me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet there are circumstances in this case which give it the character of a
      preconcerted plan," said the Prefect, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps so," said the other, in a tone of utter indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, the companion of the man who is missing, and of whom no clew
      can be discovered, is reported to have uttered your name repeatedly in his
      ravings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name,&mdash;how so?" cried the stranger, hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my Lord, the name of your passport,&mdash;Lord Glen-core. Two of
      those I have placed to watch beside his bed have repeated the same story,
      and told how he has never ceased to mutter the name to himself in his
      wanderings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this a mere fancy?" said the stranger, over whose sickly features a
      flush now mantled. "Can I see him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. He is in the hospital, and too ill to be removed; but if you
      will visit him there, I will accompany you."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only when a call was made upon Lord Glencore for some bodily
      exertion that his extreme debility became apparent. Seated at ease in a
      chair, his manner seemed merely that of natural coolness and apathy; he
      spoke as one who would not suffer his nature to be ruffled by any
      avoidable annoyance; but now, as he arose from his seat, and endeavored to
      walk, one side betrayed unmistakable signs of palsy, and his general frame
      exhibited the last stage of weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, sir, that the exertion costs its price," said he, with a sad,
      sickly smile. "I am the wreck of what once was a man noted for his
      strength."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other muttered some words of comfort and compassion, and they
      descended the stairs together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know this man," said Lord Glencore, as he gazed on the flushed
      and fevered face of the sick man, whose ill-trimmed and shaggy beard gave
      additional wild-ness to his look; "I have never, to my knowledge, seen him
      before."
    </p>
    <p>
      The accents of the speaker appeared to have suddenly struck some chord in
      the sufferer's intelligence, for he struggled for an instant, and then,
      raising himself on his elbow, stared fixedly at him. "Not know me?" cried
      he, in English; "'t is because sorrow and sickness has changed me, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you? Tell me your name?" said Glencore, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm Billy Traynor, my Lord, the one you remember, the doctor&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And my boy!" screamed Glencore, wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sick man threw up both his arms in the air, and fell backward with a
      cry of despair; while Glencore, tottering for an instant, sank with a low
      groan, and fell senseless on the ground.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVII. A FRAGMENT OF A LETTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Long before Lord Glencore had begun to rally from an attack which had
      revived all the symptoms of his former illness, Billy Traynor had
      perfectly recovered, and was assiduously occupied in attending him. Almost
      the first tidings which Glencore could comprehend assured him that the boy
      was safe, and living at Massa under the protection of the Chevalier
      Stubber, and waiting eagerly for Billy to join him. A brief extract from
      one of the youth's letters to his warm-hearted follower will suffice to
      show how he himself regarded the incident which befell, and the fortune
      that lay before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long swim, of a dark night too, Master Billy; and whenever the
      arm of a tree would jostle me, as it floated past, I felt as though that
      "blessed" courier was again upon me, and turned to give fight at once. If
      it were not that the river took a sudden bend as it nears the sea, I must
      infallibly have been carried out; but I found myself quite suddenly in
      slack water, and very soon after it shallowed so much that I could walk
      ashore. The thought of what became of my adversary weighed more heavily on
      me when I touched land; indeed, while my own chances of escape were few, I
      took his fate easily enough. With all its dangers, it was a glorious time,
      as, hurrying downward in the torrent, through the dark night, the thunder
      growling overhead, the breakers battering away on the bar, I was the only
      living thing there to confront that peril! What an emblem of my own fate
      in everything! A headlong course, an unknown ending, darkness&mdash;utter
      and day less darkness&mdash;around me, and not one single soul to say,
      "Courage!" There is something splendidly exciting in the notion of having
      felt thoughts that others have never felt,&mdash;of having set footsteps
      in that un tracked sand where no traveller has ever ventured. This
      impression never left me as I buffeted the murky waves, and struck out
      boldly through the surfy stream. Nay, more, it will never leave me while I
      live. I have now proved myself to my own heart! I have been, and for a
      considerable time too, face to face with death. I have regarded my fate as
      certain, and yet have I not quailed in spirit or flinched in coolness. No,
      Billy; I reviewed every step of my strange and wayward life. I bethought
      me of my childhood, with all its ambitious longings, and my boyish days as
      sorrow first broke upon me, and I felt that there was a fitness in this
      darksome and mysterious ending to a life that touched on no other
      existence. For am I not as much alone in the great world as when I swam
      there in the yellow flood of the Magra?
    </p>
    <p>
      As the booming breakers of the sea met my ear, and I saw that I was
      nearing the wide ocean, I felt as might a soldier when charging an enemy's
      battery at speed. I was wildly mad with impatience to get forward, and
      shouted till my voice rang out above the din around me. How the mad cheer
      echoed in my own heart! It was the trumpet-call of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it reaction from all this excitement&mdash;the depression that follows
      past danger&mdash;that made me feel low and miserable afterwards? I know I
      walked along towards Lavenza in listlessness, and when a gendarme stopped
      to question me, and asked for my passport, I had not even energy to tell
      him how I came there. Even the intense desire to see that spot once more,&mdash;to
      walk that garden and sit upon that terrace,&mdash;all had left me; it was
      as though the waves had drowned the spirit, and left the limbs to move
      unguided. He led me beside the walls of the villa, by the little wicket
      itself, and still I felt no touch of feeling, no memory came back on me; I
      was indifferent to all! and yet <i>you</i> know how many a weary mile I
      have come just to see them once more,&mdash;to revisit a spot where the
      only day-dream of my life lingered, and where I gave way to the promptings
      of a hope that have not often warmed this sad heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a sluggish swamp has this nature of mine become, when it needs a
      hurricane of passion to stir it! Here I am, living, breathing, walking,
      and sleeping, but without one sentiment that attaches me to existence; and
      yet do I feel as though whatever endangered life, or jeoparded fame would
      call me up to an effort and make me of some value to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went yesterday to see my old studio: sorry things were those strivings
      of mine,&mdash;false endeavors to realize conceptions that must have some
      other interpreter than marble. Forms are but weak appeals, words are
      coarse ones; music alone, my dear friend, is the true voice of the heart's
      meanings.
    </p>
    <p>
      How a little melody that a peasant girl was singing last night touched me!
      It was one that <i>she</i> used to warble, humming as we walked, like some
      stray waif thrown up by memory on the waste of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      So then, at last, I feel I am not a sculptor; still as little, with all
      your teaching, am I a scholar. The world of active life offers to me none
      of its seductions; I only recognize what there is in it of vulgar
      contention and low rivalry. I cannot be any of the hundred things by which
      men eke out subsistence, and yet I long for the independence of being the
      arbiter of my own daily life. What is to become of me? Say, dearest, best
      of friends,&mdash;say but the word, and let me try to obey you. What of
      our old plans of 'savagery'? The fascinations of civilized habits have
      made no stronger hold upon me since we relinquished that grand idea.
      Neither you nor I assuredly have any places assigned us at the feast of
      this old-world life; none have bidden us to it, nor have we even the
      fitting garments to grace it!
    </p>
    <p>
      There are moments, however,&mdash;one of them is on me while I write,&mdash;wherein
      I should like to storm that strong citadel of social exclusion, and test
      its strength. Who are they who garrison it? Are they better, and wiser,
      and purer than their fellows? Are they lifted by the accidents of fortune
      above the casualties and infirmities of nature? and are they more
      gentle-minded, more kindly-hearted, and more forgiving than others? This I
      should wish to know and learn for myself. Would they admit us, for the
      nonce, to see and judge them? let the Bastard and the Beggar sit down at
      their board, and make brotherhood with them? I trow not, Billy. They would
      hand us over to the police!
    </p>
    <p>
      And my friend the courier was not so far astray when he called us
      vagabonds!
    </p>
    <p>
      If I were free, I should, of course, be with you; but I am under a kind of
      mild bondage here, of which I don't clearly comprehend the meaning. The
      chief minister has taken me, in some fashion, under his protection, and I
      am given to understand that no ill is intended me; and, indeed, so far as
      treatment and moderate liberty are concerned, I have every reason to be
      satisfied. Still is there something deeply wounding in all this mysterious
      "consideration." It whispers to me of an interest in me on the part of
      those who are ashamed to avow it,&mdash;of kind feelings held in check by
      self-esteem. Good Heavens! what have <i>I</i> done, that this humiliation
      should be my portion? There is no need of any subtlety to teach me what I
      am, and what the world insists I must remain. There is no ambition I dare
      to strive for, no affection my heart may cherish, no honorable contest I
      may engage in, but that the utterance of one fatal word may not bar the
      gate against my entrance, and send me back in shame and confusion. Had I
      of myself incurred this penalty, there would be in me that stubborn sense
      of resistance that occurs to every one who counts the gain and loss of all
      his actions; but I have not done so! In the work of my own degradation I
      am blameless!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just been told that a certain Princess de Sabloukoff is to arrive
      here this evening, and that I am to wait upon her immediately. Good
      Heavens! can she be&mdash;? The thought has just struck me, and my head is
      already wandering at the bare notion of it! How I pray that this may not
      be so; my own shame is enough, and more than I can bear; but to witness
      that of&mdash;I Can you tell me nothing of this? But even if you can, the
      tidings will come too late; I shall have already seen her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am unable to write more now; my brain is burning, and my hand trembles
      so that I cannot trace the letters. Adieu till this evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was all in error, dear friend. I have seen her; for the last two hours
      we have conversed together, and my suspicion had no foundation. She
      evidently knows all my history, and almost gives me to believe that one
      day or other I may stand free of this terrible shame that oppresses me. If
      this were possible, what vengeance would be enough to wreak on those who
      have thus practised on me? Can you imagine any vendetta that would pay off
      the heart-corroding misery that has made my youth like a sorrowful old
      age, dried up hope within me, made my ambition to be a snare, and my love
      a mere mockery? I could spend a life in the search after this revenge, and
      think it all too short to exhaust it!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have much to tell you of this Princess, but I doubt if I can remember
      it. Her manner meant so much, and yet so little; there was such elegance
      of expression with such perfect ease,&mdash;so much of the <i>finest</i>
      knowledge of life united to a kind of hopeful trust in mankind, that I
      kept eternally balancing in my mind whether her intelligence or her
      kindliness had the supremacy. She spoke to me much of the Harleys. Ida was
      well, and at Florence. She had refused Wahnsdorf's offer of marriage, and
      though ardently solicited to let time test her decision, persisted in her
      rejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether she knew of my affection or not, I cannot say; but I opine not,
      for she talked of Ida as one whose haughty nature would decline alliance
      with even an imperial house if they deemed it a condescension; so that the
      refusal of Wahnsdorf may have been on this ground. But how can it matter
      to <i>me?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I am to remain here a week, I think they said. Sir Horace Upton is coming
      on his way south, and wishes to see me; but you will be with me ere that
      time, and then we can plan our future together. As this web of intrigue&mdash;for
      so I cannot but feel it&mdash;draws more closely around me, I grow more
      and more impatient to break bounds and be away! It is evident enough that
      <i>my</i> destiny is to be the sport of some accident, lucky or unlucky,
      in the fate of others. Shall I await this?
    </p>
    <p>
      And they have given me money, and fine clothes, and a servant to wait upon
      me, and treated me like one of condition. Is this but another act of the
      drama, the first scene of which was an old ruined castle in Ireland? They
      will fail signally if they think so; a heart can be broken only once! They
      may even feel sorry for what they have done, but I can never forgive them
      for what they have made me! Come to me, dear, kind friend, as soon as you
      can; you little know how far your presence reconciles me to the world and
      to yourself!&mdash;Ever yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      C. M.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter Billy Traynor read over and over as he sat by Glencore's
      bedside. It was his companion in the long, dreary hours of the night, and
      he pondered over it as he sat in the darkened room at noonday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that you are crumpling up there? From whom is the letter?" said
      Lord Glencore, as Billy hurriedly endeavored to conceal the oft-perused
      epistle. "Nay," cried he, suddenly correcting himself, "you need not tell
      me; I asked without forethought." He paused a few seconds, and then went
      on: "I am now as much recovered as I ever hope to be, and you may leave me
      to-morrow. I know that both your wish and your duty call you elsewhere.
      Whatever future fortune may betide any of us, you at least have been a
      true and faithful friend, and shall never want! As I count upon your
      honesty to keep a pledge, I reckon on your delicacy not asking the reasons
      for it. You will, therefore, not speak of having been with me here. To
      mention me would be but to bring up bitter memories."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the pause which now ensued, Billy Traynor's feelings underwent a sore
      trial; for while he bethought him that now or never had come the moment to
      reconcile the father and the son, thus mysteriously separated, his fears
      also whispered the danger of any ill-advised step on his part, and the
      injury he might by possibility inflict on one he loved best on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You make me this pledge, therefore, before we part," said Lord Glencore,
      who continued to ruminate on what he had spoken. "It is less for <i>my</i>
      sake than that of another." Billy took the hand Glencore tendered towards
      him respectfully in his own, and kissed it twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are men who have no need of oaths to ratify their faith and
      trustfulness. You are one of them, Tray-nor," said Glencore,
      affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy tried to speak, but his heart was too full, and he could not utter a
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A dying man's words have ever their solemn weight," said Glencore, "and
      mine beseech you not to desert one who has no prize in life equal to your
      friendship. Promise me nothing, but do not forget my prayer to you." And
      with this, Lord Glencore turned away, and buried his face between his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And in the name of Heaven," muttered Billy to himself as he stole away,
      "what is it that keeps them apart and won't let them love one another?
      Sure it wasn't in nature that a boy of his years could ever do what would
      separate them this way. What could he possibly say or do that his father
      might n't forget and forgive by this time? And then if it was n't the
      child's fault at all, where's the justice in makin' him pay for another's
      crime? Sure enough, great people must be unlike poor craytures like me, in
      their hearts and feelin's as well as in their grandeur; and there must be
      things that <i>we</i> never mind nor think of, that are thought to be
      mortial injuries by <i>them</i>. Ay, and that is raysonable too! We see
      the same in the matayrial world. There's fevers that some never takes; and
      there's climates some can live in, and no others can bear!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose, now," said he, with a wise shake of the head, "pride&mdash;pride
      is at the root of it all, some way or other; and if it is, I may give up
      the investigation at onst, for divil a one o' me knows what pride is,&mdash;barrin'
      it's the delight one feels in consthruin' a hard bit in a Greek chorus, or
      hittin' the manin' of a doubtful passage in ould Æschylus. But what's the
      good o' me puzzlin' myself? If I was to speculate for fifty years, I 'd
      never be able to think like a lord, after all!" And with this conclusion
      he began to prepare for his journey.

      CHAPTER XLVIII. HOW A SOVEREIGN TREATS WITH HIS MINISTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      "What can have brought them here, Stubber?" said the Duke of Massa, as he
      walked to and fro in his dressing-room, with an air of considerable
      perturbation. "Be assured of one thing, they have come for mischief! I
      know that Sabloukoff well. <i>She</i> it was separated Prince Max from my
      sister, and that Montenegro affair was all <i>her</i> doing also."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't suspect&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you? Well, then, <i>I</i> do, sir; and that's enough," said he,
      interrupting. "And as to Upton, he's well known throughout Europe,&mdash;a
      'mauvais coucheur,' Stubber; that's what the Emperor Franz called him,&mdash;a
      'mauvais coucheur,' one of those fellows England employs to get up the
      embarrassments she so deeply deplores. Eh, Stubber, that's the phrase:
      'While we deeply deplore the condition of the kingdom,'&mdash;that's
      always the exordium to sending out a fleet or an impertinent despatch. But
      I'll not endure it here. I have my sovereign rights, my independence, my
      allies. By the way, haven't my allies taken possession of the Opera House
      for a barrack?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That they have, sir; and they threaten an encampment in the Court
      gardens."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An open insult, an outrage! And have <i>you</i> endured and submitted to
      this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have refused the permission; but they may very possibly take no heed of
      my protest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you 'll tell me that I am the ruler of this state?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but I 'll say you might, if you liked to be so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so, Stubber? Come, my worthy fellow, what's your plan? You have a
      plan, I'm certain&mdash;but I guess it: turn Protestant, hunt out the
      Jesuits, close the churches, demolish the monasteries, and send for an
      English frigate down to the Marina, where there's not water to float a
      fishing-boat. But no, sir, I 'll have no such alliances; I 'll throw
      myself upon the loyalty and attachment of my people, and&mdash;I'll raise
      the taxes. Eh, Stubber? We'll tax the 'colza' and the quarries! If they
      demur, we 'll abdicate; that's my last word,&mdash;abdicate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder who this sick man can be that accompanies Upton," said Stubber,
      who never suffered himself to be moved by his master's violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another firebrand,&mdash;another emissary of English disturbance.
      Hardenberg was perfectly right when he said the English nation pays off
      the meanest subserviency to their own aristocracy by hunting down all that
      is noble in every state of Europe. There, sir, he hit the mark in the very
      centre. Slaves at home, rebels abroad,&mdash;that's your code!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We contrive to mix up a fair share of liberty with our bondage, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In your talk,&mdash;only in your talk; and in the newspapers, Stubber. I
      have studied you closely and attentively. You submit to more social
      indignities than any nation, ancient or modern. I was in London in '15,
      and I remember, at a race-course,&mdash;Ascot, they called it,&mdash;the
      Prince had a certain horse called Rufus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I rode him," said Stubber, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>You</i> rode him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir. I was his jock for the King's Plate. There was a matter of
      twenty-eight started,&mdash;the largest field ever known for the Cup,&mdash;and
      Rufus reared, and, falling back, killed his rider; and the Duke of
      Dunrobin sent for me, and told me to mount. That's the way I came to be
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Per Bacco!</i> it was a splendid race, and I'm sure I never suspected
      when I cheered you coming in, that I was welcoming my future minister. Eh,
      Stubber, only fancy what a change!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stubber only shrugged his shoulders, as though the alteration in fortune
      was no such great prize after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won two thousand guineas on that day, Stubber. Lord Heddleworth paid me
      in gold, I remember; for they picked my pocket of three rouleaux on the
      course. The Prince laughed so at dinner about it, and said it was pure
      patriotism not to suffer exportation of bullion. A great people the
      English, that I must say! The display of wealth was the grandest spectacle
      I ever beheld; and such beauty too! By the way, Stubber, our ballet here
      is detestable. Where did they gather together that gang of horrors?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? signifies it, sir, if the Austrian Jagers are bivouacked in the
      theatre?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true, by Jove!" said the Duke, pondering. "Can't we hit upon
      something,&mdash;have you no happy suggestion? I have it, Stubber,&mdash;an
      admirable thought. We 'll have Upton to dinner. We 'll make it appear that
      he has come here specially to treat with us. There is a great coldness
      just now between St. James's and Vienna. Upton will be charmed with the
      thought of an intrigue; so will be La Sabloukoff. We 'll not invite the
      Field-Marshal Rosen-krantz: that will itself offend Austria. Eh, Stubber,
      is n't it good? Say to-morrow at six, and go yourself with the
      invitation."
    </p>
    <p>
      And, overjoyed with the notion of his own subtlety, the Prince walked up
      and down, laughing heartily, and rubbing his hands in glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stubber, however, was too well versed in the changeability of his master's
      nature to exhibit any rash promptitude in obeying him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must manage to let the English papers speak of this, Stubber. The
      'Augsburg Gazette' will be sure to copy the paragraph, and what a
      sensation it will create at Vienna!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am inclined to think Upton has come here about that young fellow we
      gave up to the Austrians last autumn, and for whom he desires to claim
      some compensation and an ample apology."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Apology, of course, Stubber,&mdash;humiliation to any extent. I'll send
      the Minister Landelli into exile,&mdash;to the galleys, if they insist;
      but I 'll not pay a scudo,&mdash;my royal word on it! But who says that
      such is the reason of his presence here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had a hint of it last night, and I received a polite note from Upton
      this morning, asking when he might have a few moments' conversation with
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go to him, Stubber, with our invitation. Ask him if he likes shooting.
      Say I am going to Serravezza on Saturday; sound him if he desires to have
      the Red Cross of Massa; hint that I am an ardent admirer of his public
      career; and be sure to tell me something he has said or done, if he come
      to dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is to be a dinner, then, sir?" asked Stubber, with the air of one
      partly struggling with a conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have said so, Chevalier!" replied the Prince, haughtily, and in the
      tone of a man whose decisions were irrevocable. "I mean to dine in the
      state apartments, and to have a reception in the evening, just to show
      Rosenkrantz how cheaply we hold him. Eh, Stubber? It will half kill him to
      come with the general company!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stubber gave a faint sigh, as though fresh complications and more troubles
      would be the sole results of this brilliant tactique.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I were well served and faithfully obeyed, there is not a sovereign in
      Europe who would boast a more independent position,&mdash;protected by my
      bold people, environed by my native Apennines, and sustained by the proud
      consciousness&mdash;the proud consciousness&mdash;-that I cannot injure a
      state which has not sixpence in the treasury! Eh, Stubber?" cried he, with
      a burst of merry laughter. "That's the grand feature of composure and
      dignity, to know you can't be worse! and this, we Italian princes can all
      indulge in. Look at the Pope himself, he is collecting the imposts a year
      in advance!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope that this country is more equitably administered," said Stubber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So do I, sir. Were I not impressed with the full conviction that the
      subjects of this realm were in the very fullest enjoyment of every liberty
      consistent with public tranquillity, protected in the maintenance of every
      privilege&mdash;By the way, talking of privileges, they must n't play
      'Trottolo' on the high roads; they sent one of those cursed wheels flying
      between the legs of my horse yesterday, so that if I had n't been an old
      cavalry soldier, I must have been thrown! I ordered the whole village to
      be fined three hundred scudi, one half of which to be sent to the shrine
      of our Lady of Loretta, who really, I believe, kept me in my saddle!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the people had sufficient occupation, they 'd not play 'Trottolo,'"
      said Stubber, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And whose the fault if they have not, sir? How many months have I been
      entreating to have those terraced gardens finished towards the sea? I want
      that olive wood, too, all stubbed up, and the ground laid out in handsome
      parterres. How repeatedly have I asked for a bridge over that ornamental
      lake; and as to the island, there's not a magnolia planted in it yet.
      Public works, indeed; find me the money, Stubber, and I 'll suggest the
      works. Then, there 's that villa, the residence of those English people,&mdash;have
      we not made a purchase of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, your Highness; we could not agree about the terms, and I have just
      heard that the stranger who is travelling with Upton is going to buy it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stepping in between me and an object I have in view! And in my own Duchy,
      too! And you have the hardihood to tell me that you knew of and permitted
      this negotiation to go on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing in the law to prevent it, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The law! What impertinence to tell me of the law I Why, sir, it is I am
      the law,&mdash;I am the head and fountain of all law here; without my
      sanction, what can presume to be legal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I opine that the Act which admits foreigners to possess property in the
      state was passed in the life of your Highness's father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I repeal it, then! It saps the nationality of a people; it is a blow
      aimed at the very heart of independent sovereignty. I may stand alone in
      all Europe on this point, but I will maintain it. And as to this stranger,
      let his passport be sent to him on the spot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He may possibly be an Englishman, your Highness: and remember that we
      have already a troublesome affair on our hands with that other youth, who
      in some way claims Upton's protection. Had we not better go more
      cautiously to work? I can see and speak with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a tyranny is this English interference! There is not a land, from
      Sweden to Sicily, where, on some assumed ground of humanity, your
      Government have not dared to impose their opinions! You presume to assert
      that all men must feel precisely like your dogged and hard-headed
      countrymen, and that what are deemed grievances in your land should be
      thought so elsewhere. You write up a code for the whole world, built out
      of the materials of all your national prejudices, your insular conceit,&mdash;ay,
      and out of the very exigencies of your bad climate; and then you say to
      us, blessed in the enjoyment of light hearts and God's sunshine, that we
      must think and feel as you do! I am not astonished that my nobles are
      discontented with the share you possess of my confidence; they must long
      have seen how little suited the maxims of your national policy are to the
      habits of a happier population!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The people are far better than their nobles,&mdash;that I 'm sure of,"
      said Stubber, stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want to preach socialism to me, and hope to convert me to that
      splendid doctrine of communism we hear so much of. You are a dangerous
      fellow,&mdash;a very dangerous fellow. It was precisely men of your stamp
      sapped the monarchy in France, and with it all monarchy in Europe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If your Highness intends Proserpine to run at Bologna, she ought to be
      put in training at once," said Stubber, gravely; "and we might send up
      some of the weeds at the same time, and sell them off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well thought of, Stubber; and there was something else in my head,&mdash;what
      was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The suppression of the San Lorenzo convent, perhaps; it is all completed,
      and only waits your Highness to sign the deed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sum does it give us, Stubber, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About one hundred and eighty thousand scudi, sir, of which some twenty
      thousand go to the National Mortgage Fund."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not one crown of it,&mdash;not a single bajocco, as I am a Christian
      knight and a true gentleman. I need it all, if it were twice as much. If
      we incur the anger of the Pope and the Sacred College,&mdash;if we risk
      the thunders of the Vatican,&mdash;let us have the worldly consolation of
      a full purse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I advised the measure on wiser grounds, sir. It was not fair and just
      that a set of lazy friars should be leading lives of indolence and
      abundance in the midst of a hard-worked and ill-fed peasantry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite true; and on these wise grounds, as you call them, we have rooted
      them out. We only wish that the game were more plenty, for the sport
      amuses us vastly." And he clapped Stubber familiarly on the shoulder, and
      laughed heartily at his jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in this happy frame of mind that Stubber always liked to leave his
      master; and so, promising to attend to the different subjects discussed
      between them, he bowed and withdrew.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIX. SOCIAL DIPLOMACIES
    </h2>
    <p>
      "What an insufferable bore, dear Princess!" sighed Sir Horace, as he
      opened the square-shaped envelope that contained his Royal Highnesses
      invitation to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean to be seriously indisposed," said Madame de Sabloukoff; "one gets
      nothing but chagrin in intercourse with petty Courts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like provincial journals, they only reproduce what has appeared in the
      metropolitan papers, and give you old gossip for fresh intelligence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or, worse again, ask you to take an interest in their miserable
      'localisms,'&mdash;the microscopic contentions of insect life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They have given us a sentry at the door, I perceive," said Sir Horace,
      with assumed indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very proper attention!" remarked the lady, in a tone that more than
      half implied the compliment was one intended for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen the Chevalier Stubber yet?" asked Upton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; he has been twice here, but I was dressing, or writing notes. And
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told him to come about two o'clock," sighed Sir Horace. "I rather like
      Stubber."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was said in a tone of such condescension that it sounded as though
      the utterer was confessing to an amicable weakness in his nature,&mdash;"I
      rather like Stubber."
    </p>
    <p>
      Though there was something meant to invite agreement in the tone, the
      Princess only accepted the speech with a slight motion of her eyebrows,
      and a look of half unwilling assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know he's not of <i>your</i> world, dear Princess, but he belongs to
      that Anglo-Saxon stock we are so prone to associate with all the ideas of
      rugged, unadorned virtue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rugged and unadorned indeed!" echoed the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet never vulgar," rejoined Upton,&mdash;"never affecting to be other
      than he is; and, stranger still, not self-opinionated and conceited."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I own to you," said she, haughtily, "that the whole Court here puts me in
      mind of Hayti, with its Marquis of Orgeat and its Count Marmalade. These
      people, elevated from menial station to a mock nobility, only serve to
      throw ridicule upon themselves and the order that they counterfeit. No
      socialist in Europe has done such service to the cause of democracy as the
      Prince of Massa!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Honesty is such a very rare quality in this world that I am not surprised
      at his Highness prizing it under any garb. Now, Stubber is honest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He says so himself, I am told."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he says so, and I believe him. He has been employed in situations of
      considerable trust, and always acquitted himself well. Such a man cannot
      have escaped temptations, and yet even his enemies do not accuse him of
      venality."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens! what more would he have than his legitimate spoils? He is a
      Minister of the Household, with an ample salary; a Master of the Horse; an
      inspector of Woods and Forests; a something over Church lands; and a Red
      Cross of Massa besides. I am quite 'made up' in his dignities, for they
      are all set forth on his visiting-card with what purports to be a coat of
      arms at top." And, as she spoke, she held out the card in derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's silly, I must say," said Upton, smiling; "and yet, I suppose that
      here in Massa it was requisite he should assert all his pretensions thus
      openly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps so," said she, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, after all," said Upton, who seemed rather bent on a system of mild
      tormenting,&mdash;"after all, there is something amiable in the weakness
      of this display,&mdash;it smacks of gratitude! It is like saying to the
      world, 'See what the munificence of my master has made me!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a delicate compliment, too, to his nobles, which proclaims that for
      a station of trust and probity the Prince must recruit from the kitchen
      and the stables. To <i>my</i> thinking, there is no such impertinent
      delusion as that popular one which asserts that we must seek for
      everything in its least likely place,&mdash;take ministers out of
      counting-houses, and military commanders from shop-boards. For the
      treatment of weighty questions in peace or war, the gentleman element is
      the first essential."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as long as the world thinks so, dear Princess; not an hour longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess arose, and walked the room in evident displeasure. She half
      suspected that his objections were only devices to irritate, and she
      determined not to prolong the discussion. The temptation to reply proved,
      however, too strong for her resolution, and she said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The world has thought so for some centuries; and when a passing shade of
      doubt has shaken the conviction, have not the people rushed from
      revolution into actual bondage, as though any despotism were better than
      the tyranny of their own passions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I opine," said Upton, calmly, "that the 'prestige' of the gentleman
      consists in his belonging to an 'order.' Now, that is a privilege that
      cannot be enjoyed by a mere popular leader. It is like the contrast
      between a club and a public meeting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is something that you confess these people have no 'prestige,'" said
      she, triumphantly. "Indeed, their presence in the world of politics, to my
      thinking, is a mere symbol of change,&mdash;an evidence that we are in
      some stage of transition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So we are, madame; there is nothing more true. Every people of Europe
      have outgrown their governments, like young heirs risen to manhood,
      ordering household affairs to their will. The popular voice now swells
      above the whisper of cabinets. So long as each country limits itself to
      home questions, this spirit will attract but slight notice. Let the issue,
      however, become a great international one, and you will see the popular
      will declaring wars, cementing alliances, and signing peaces in a fashion
      to make statecraft tremble!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you approve of this change, and welcome it?" asked she, derisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never said so, madame. I foresee the hurricane, that's all. Men
      like Stubber are to be seen almost everywhere throughout Europe. They are
      a kind of declaration that, for the government and guidance of mankind,
      the possession of a good head and an honest heart is amply sufficient;
      that rulers neither need fourteen quarterings nor names coeval with the
      Roman Empire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have given me but another reason to detest him," said the Princess,
      angrily. "I don't think I shall receive him to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you want to speak with him about that villa; there is some formality
      to be gone through before a foreigner can own property here. I think you
      promised Glencore you would arrange the matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply, and he continued: "Poor fellow! a very short lease
      would suffice for his time; he is sinking rapidly. The conflict his mind
      wages between hope and doubt has hastened all the symptoms of his malady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In such a struggle a woman has more courage than a man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say more boldness, Princess," said Upton, slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I repeat, courage, sir. It is fear, and nothing but fear, that agitates
      him. He is afraid of the world's sneer; afraid of what society will think,
      and say, and write about him; afraid of the petty gossip of the millions
      he will never see or hear of. This cowardice it is that checks him in
      every aspiration to vindicate his wife's honor and his boy's birth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Si cela se peut</i>," said Upton, with a very equivocal smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of haughty anger, with a flush of crimson on her cheek, was the
      only answer she made him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean that he is really not in a position to prove or disprove anything.
      He assumed certain 'levities'&mdash;I suppose the word will do&mdash;to
      mean more than levities; he construed indiscretions into grave faults, and
      faults into crimes. But that he did all this without sufficient reason, or
      that he now has abundant evidence that he was mistaken, I am unable to
      say, nor is it with broken faculties and a wandering intellect that he can
      be expected to review the past and deliver judgment on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The whole moral of which is: what a luckless fate is that of a foreign
      wife United to an English husband!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is much force in the remark," said Upton, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To have her thoughts, and words, and actions submitted to the standard of
      a nation whose moral subtleties she could never comprehend; to be taught
      that a certain amount of gloom must be mixed up with life, just as bitters
      are taken for tonics; that <i>ennui</i> is the sure type of virtue, and
      low spirits the healthiest condition of the mind,&mdash;these are her
      first lessons: no wonder if she find them hard ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be told that all the harmless familiarities she has seen from her
      childhood are dangerous freedoms, all the innocent gayeties of the world
      about her are snares and pitfalls, is to make existence little better than
      a penal servitude,&mdash;this is lesson the second. While, to complete her
      education, she is instructed how to assume a censorial rigidity of manner
      that would shame a duenna, and a condemnatory tone that assumes to arraign
      all the criminals of society, and pass sentence on them. How amiable she
      may become in disposition, and how suitable as a companion by this
      training, <i>you</i>, sir, and your countrymen are best able to
      pronounce."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You rather exaggerate our demerits, my dear Princess," said Upton,
      smiling. "We really do <i>not</i> like to be so very odious as you would
      make us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are excellent people, with whom no one can live,&mdash;that's the
      whole of it," said she, with a saucy laugh. "If your friend Lord Glencore
      had been satisfied to stay at home and marry one of his own nation, he
      might have escaped a deal of unhappiness, and saved a most amiable
      creature much more sorrow than falls to the lot of the least fortunate of
      her own country. I conclude you have some influence over him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As much, perhaps, as any one; but even that says little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you not use it, therefore, to make him repair a great wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had some plan, I think?" said he, hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I have written to her to come down here. I have pretended that her
      presence is necessary to certain formalities about the sale of the villa.
      I mean that they should meet, without apprising either of them. I have
      sent the boy out of the way to Pontremoli to make me a copy of some
      frescoes there; till the success of my scheme be decided, I did not wish
      to make him a party to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know Glencore,&mdash;at least as I know him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no reason that I should," broke she in. "What I would try is an
      experiment, every detail of which I would leave to chance. Were this a
      case where all the wrong were on one side, and all the forgiveness to come
      from the other, friendly aid and interposition might well be needed; but
      here is a complication which neither you, nor I, nor any one else can
      pretend to unravel. Let them meet, therefore, and let Fate&mdash;if that
      be the name for it&mdash;decide what all the prevention and planning in
      the world could never provide for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very fact that their meeting has been plotted beforehand will suggest
      distrust."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Their manner in meeting will be the best answer to that," said she,
      resolutely. "There will be no acting between them, depend upon 't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He told me that he had destroyed the registry of their marriage, nor does
      he know where a single witness of the ceremony could be found."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to know <i>how</i> he could make the <i>amende</i> till I
      know that he is ready to do it," said she, in the same calm tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To have arranged a meeting with the boy had perhaps been better than
      this. Glencore has not avowed it, but I think I can detect misgivings for
      his treatment of the youth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This was my first thought, and I spoke to young Massy the evening before
      Lord Glencore arrived. I led him to tell me of his boyish days in Ireland
      and his home there; a stern resolution to master all emotion seemed to
      pervade whatever he said; and though, perhaps, the effort may have cost
      him much, his manner did not betray it. He told me that he was
      illegitimate, that the secret was divulged to him by his own father, that
      he had never heard who his mother was, nor what rank in life she occupied.
      When I said that she was one in high station, that she was alive and well,
      and one of my own dearest friends, a sudden crimson covered his face, as
      quickly followed by a sickly pallor; and though he trembled in every limb,
      he never spoke a word. I endeavored to excite in him some desire to learn
      more of her, if not to see her, but in vain. The hard lesson he had taught
      himself enabled him to repress every semblance of feeling. It was only
      when at last, driven to the very limits of my patience, I abruptly asked
      him, 'Have you no wish to see your mother?' that his coldness gave way,
      and, in a voice tremulous and thick, he said, 'My shame is enough for
      myself.' I was burning to say more, to put before him a contingency, the
      mere shadow of a possibility that his claim to birth and station might one
      day or other be vindicated. I did not actually do so, but I must have let
      drop some chance word that betrayed my meaning, for he caught me up
      quickly, and said, 'It would come too late, if it came even to-day. I am
      that which I am by many a hard struggle; you 'll never see me risk a
      disappointment in life by any encouragement I may give to hope.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I then adverted to his father; but he checked me at once, saying, 'When
      the ties that should be closest in life are stained with shame and
      dishonor, they are bonds of slavery, not of affection. My debt to Lord
      Glencore is the degradation I live in,&mdash;none other. His heritage to
      me is the undying conflict in my heart between what I once thought I was
      and what I now know I am. If we met, it would be to tell him so.' In a
      word, every feature of the father's proud unforgivingness is reproduced in
      the boy, and I dreaded the very possibility of their meeting. If ever Lord
      Glencore avow his marriage and vindicate his wife's honor, his hardest
      task will be reconciliation with this boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All, and more than all, the evils I anticipated have followed this insane
      vengeance," said Upton. "I begin to think that one ought to leave a golden
      bridge even to our revenge, Princess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Assuredly, wherever a woman is the victim," said she, smiling; "for you
      are so certain to have reasons for distrusting yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upton sat meditating for some time on the plan of the Princess; had it
      only originated with himself, it was exactly the kind of project he would
      have liked. He knew enough of life to be aware that one can do very little
      more than launch events upon the great ocean of destiny; that the
      pretension to guide and direct them is oftener a snare than anything else;
      that the contingencies and accidents, the complications too, which beset
      every move in life, disconcert all one's pre-arrangements, so that it is
      rare indeed when we are able to pursue the same path towards any object by
      which we have set out.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the scheme was, however, that of another, he now scrutinized it, and
      weighed every objection to its accomplishment, constantly returning to the
      same difficulty, as he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not know Glencore."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man who has but one passion, one impulse in life, is rarely a
      difficult study," was the measured reply. "Lord Glencore's vengeance has
      worn itself out, exactly as all similar outbreaks of temper do, for want
      of opposition. There was nothing to feed, nothing to minister to it. He
      sees&mdash;I have taken care that he should see&mdash;that his bolt has
      not struck the mark; that her position is not the precarious thing he
      meant to make it, but a station as much protected and fenced round by its
      own conventionalities as that of any, the proudest lady in society. For
      one that dares to impugn her, there are full fifty ready to condemn <i>him</i>;
      and all this has been done without reprisal or recrimination; no
      partisanship to arraign his moroseness and his cruelty,&mdash;none of that
      'coterie' defence which divides society into two sections. This, of
      course, has wounded his pride, but it has not stimulated his anger; but,
      above all, it has imparted to her the advantage of a dignity of which his
      vengeance was intended to deprive her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be a sanguine and a hopeful spirit, Princess, if you deem that
      such elements will unite happily hereafter," said Upton, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really never carried my speculations so far," replied she. "It is in
      actual life, as in that of the stage, quite sufficient to accompany the
      actors to the fall of the curtain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Chevalier Stubber, madame," said a servant, entering, "wishes to know
      if you will receive him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;no&mdash;yes. Tell him to come in," said, she rapidly, as she
      resumed her seat beside the fire.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER L. ANTE-DINNER REFLECTIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the strongly expressed sentiments of the Princess with
      regard to the Chevalier Stubber, she received him with marked favor, and
      gave him her hand to kiss, with evident cordiality. As for Upton, it was
      the triumph of his manner to deal with men separated widely from himself
      in station and abilities. He could throw such an air of good fellowship
      into the smallest attentions, impart such a glow of kindliness to the
      veriest commonplaces, that the very craftiest and shrewdest could never
      detect. As he leaned his arm, therefore, on Stubber's shoulder, and smiled
      benignly on him, you would have said it was the affectionate meeting with
      a long-absent brother. But there was something besides this: there was the
      expansive confidence accorded to a trusty colleague; and as he asked him
      about the Duchy, its taxation, its debt, its alliances and difficulties,
      you might mark in the attention he bestowed all the signs of one receiving
      very valuable information.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You perceive, Princess," said he, at last, "Stubber quite agrees with the
      Duke of Cloudeslie,&mdash;these small states enjoy no real independence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why are they not absorbed into the larger nations about them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They have their uses; they are like substances interposed between
      conflicting bodies, which receive and diminish the shock of collisions. So
      that Prussia, when wanting to wound Austria, only pinches Baden; and
      Austria, desirous of insulting Saxony, 'takes it out' on Sigmaringen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a pleasant destiny you assign them," said she, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stubber will tell you I'm not far wrong in my appreciation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm not for what they call 'mediatizing' them neither, my Lady," said
      Stubber, who generally used the designation to imply his highest degree of
      respect. "That may all be very well for the interests of the great states,
      and the balance of power, and all that sort of thing; but we ought also to
      bestow a thought upon the people of these small countries, especially on
      the inhabitants of their cities. What's to become of <i>them</i> when you
      withdraw their courts, and throw their little capitals into the position
      of provincial towns and even villages?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will eke out a livelihood somehow, my dear Stubber. Be assured that
      they 'll not starve. Masters of the Horse may have to keep livery stables;
      chamberlains turn valets; ladies of the bedchamber descend to the arts of
      millinery: but, after all, the change will be but in name, and there will
      not be a whit more slavery in the new condition than in the old one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I 'm not so sure they 'll take the same comfortable view of it that
      you do, Sir Horace," said Stubber; "nor can I see who can possibly want
      livery stables, or smart bonnets, or even a fine butler, when the
      resources of the Court are withdrawn, and the city left to its own
      devices."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stubber suspects," said Upton, "that the policy which prevails amongst
      our great landed proprietors against small holdings is that which at
      present influences the larger states of Europe against small kingdoms; and
      so far he is right. It is unquestionably the notion of our day that the
      influences of government require space for their exercise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the happiness of the people was to be thought of, which of course it
      is not," said Stubber, "I'd say leave them as they are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my dear Stubber, you are now drawing the question into the realm of
      the imaginary. What do any of us know about our happiness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough to eat and drink, a comfortable roof over you, good clothes,
      nothing oppressive or unequal in the laws,&mdash;these go for a good way
      in the kind of thing I mean; and let me observe, sir, it is a great
      privilege little states, like little people, enjoy, that they need have no
      ambitions. They don't want to conquer anybody; they neither ask for the
      mouth of a river here, or an island there; and if only let alone, they 'll
      never disturb the peace of the world at large."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Stubber, you are quite a proficient at state-craft," said Upton,
      with the very least superciliousness in the accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't know, Sir Horace," said the other, modestly, "but as my
      master's means are about the double of what they were when I entered his
      service, and as the people pay about one-sixth less in taxes than they
      used to do, mayhap I might say that I have put the saddle on the right
      part of the back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your foreign policy does not seem quite as unobjectionable as your home
      management. That was an ugly business about that boy you gave up to the
      Austrians."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there were mistakes on all sides. You yourself, Sir Horace, gave
      him a false passport; his real name turns out to be Massy: it made an
      impression on me, from a circumstance that happened when I was a young
      fellow living as pad-groom with Prince Tottskoy. I went over on a lark one
      day to Capri, and was witness to a wedding there of a young Englishman
      called Massy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you, then, present at the ceremony?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; and what's stranger still, I have a voucher for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A voucher for it. What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was this way, sir. There was a great supper for the country people and
      the servants, and I was there, and I suppose I took too much of that Capri
      wine; it was new and hot at the time, and I got into a row of some sort,
      and I beat the Deputato from some place or t' other, and got locked up for
      three days; and the priest, a very jolly fellow, gave me under his
      handwriting a voucher that I had been a witness of the marriage, and all
      the festivities afterwards, just to show my master how everything
      happened. But the Prince never asked me for any explanations, and only
      said he 'hoped I had amused myself well;' and so I kept my voucher to
      myself, and I have it at this very hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you let me see it, Stubber?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure, sir, you shall have it, if I can lay my hand on 't in the
      course of the day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me beg you will go at once and search for it; it may be of more
      importance than you know of. Go, my dear Stubber, and look it up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll not lose a moment, since you wish to have it," said Stubber; "and I
      am sure your ladyship will excuse my abrupt departure."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess assured him that her own interest in the document was not
      inferior to that of Sir Horace, and he hastened off to prosecute his
      search.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, then, are all my plans altered at once," exclaimed she, as the door
      closed after him. "If this paper mean only as much as he asserts, it will
      be ample proof of marriage, and lead us to the knowledge of all those who
      were present at it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet must we well reflect on the use we make of it," said Upton. "Glencore
      is now evidently balancing what course to take. As his chances of recovery
      grow less each day, he seems to incline more and more to repair the wrong
      he has done. Should we show on our side the merest semblance of
      compulsion, I would not answer for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that we have the power, as a last resource, I am content to
      diplomatize," said the Princess; "but you must see him this evening, and
      press for a decision."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has already asked me to come to him after we return from Court. It
      will be late, but it is the hour at which he likes best to talk. If I see
      occasion for it, I can allude to what Stubber has told us; but it will be
      only if driven by necessity to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would act more boldly and more promptly," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And rouse an opposition, perhaps, that already is becoming dormant. No, I
      know Glencore well, and will deal with him more patiently."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the Chevalier Stubber, your Excellency," said a servant, presenting
      a sealed packet; and Sir Horace opened it at once. The envelope contained
      a small and shabby slip of paper, of which the writing appeared faint and
      indistinct. It was dated 18&mdash;, Church of St. Lorenzo, Capri, and went
      to certify that Guglielmo Stubber had been present, on the morning of the
      18th August, at the marriage of the Most Noble Signor Massy with the
      Princess de la Torre, having in quality as witness signed the registry
      thereof; and then went on to state the circumstance of his attendance at
      the supper, and the event which ensued. It bore the name of the writer at
      foot, Basilio Nardoni, priest of the aforesaid church and village.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little is Glencore aware that such an evidence as this is in existence,"
      said Upton. "The conviction that he had his vengeance in his power led him
      into this insane project. He fancied there was not a flaw in that terrible
      indictment; and see, here is enough to open the door to truth, and undo
      every detail of all his plotting. How strange is it that the events of
      life should so often concur to expose the dark schemes of men's hearts;
      proofs starting up in un-thought-of places, as though to show how vain was
      mere subtlety in conflict with the inevitable law of Fate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This Basilio Nardoni is an acquaintance of mine," said the Princess, bent
      on pursuing another train of thought; "he was chaplain to the Cardinal
      Caraffa, and frequently brought me communications from his Eminence. He
      can be found, if wanted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is unlikely&mdash;most unlikely&mdash;that we shall require him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you mean that Lord Glencore will himself make all the amends he can
      for a gross injury and a fraud, no more is necessary," said she, folding
      the paper, and placing it in her pocket-book; "but if anything short of
      this be intended, then there is no exposure too open, no publicity too
      wide, to be given to the most cruel wrong the world has ever heard of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave me to deal with Glencore. I think I am about the only one who can
      treat with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now for this dinner at Court, for I have changed my mind, and mean to
      go," said the Princess. "It is full time to dress, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is almost six o'clock," said Upton, starting up. "We have quite
      forgotten ourselves."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LI. CONFLICTING THOUGHTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Princess Sabloukoff found&mdash;not by any means an unfrequent
      experience in life&mdash;that the dinner, whose dulness she had dreaded,
      turned out a very pleasant affair. The Prince was unusually gracious. He
      was in good spirits, and put forth powers of agreeability which had been
      successful in one of less distinction than himself. He possessed
      eminently, what a great orator once panegyrized as a high conversational
      element, "great variety," and could without abruptness pass from subject
      to subject, with always what showed he had bestowed thought upon the theme
      before him. Great people have few more enviable privileges than that they
      choose their own topics for conversation. Nothing disagreeable, nothing
      wearisome, nothing inopportune, can be intruded upon them. When they have
      no longer anything worth saying, they can change the subject or the
      company.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Highness talked with Madame de Sabloukoff on questions of state as he
      might have talked with a Metternich; he even invited from her expressions
      of opinion that were almost counsels, sentiments that might pass for
      warnings. He ranged over the news of the day, relating occasionally some
      little anecdote, every actor in which was a celebrity; or now and then
      communicating some piece of valueless secrecy, told with all the mystery
      of a "great fact;" and then he discussed with Upton the condition of
      England, and deplored, as all Continental rulers do, the impending
      downfall of that kingdom, from the growing force of our restless and
      daring democracy. He regretted much that Sir Horace was not still in
      office, but consoled himself by reflecting that the pleasure he enjoyed in
      his society had been in that case denied him. In fact, what with
      insinuated flatteries, little signs of confidence, and a most marked tone
      of cordiality, purposely meant to strike beholders, the Prince conducted
      the conversation right royally, and played "Highness" to perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      And these two crafty, keen-sighted people, did they not smile at the
      performance, and did they not, as they drove home at night, amuse
      themselves as they recounted the little traits of the great man's dupery?
      Not a bit of it. They were charmed with his gracious manner, and actually
      enchanted with his agreeability. Strong in their self-esteem, they could
      not be brought to suspect that any artifice could be practised on <i>them</i>,
      or that the mere trickery and tinsel of high station could be imposed on
      them as true value. Nay, they even went further, and discovered that his
      Highness was really a very remarkable man, and one who received far less
      than the estimation due to him. His flightiness became versatility; his
      eccentricity was all originalty; and ere they reached the hotel, they had
      endowed him with almost every moral and mental quality that can dignify
      manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is really a magnificent turquoise," said the Princess, gazing with
      admiration at a ring the Prince had taken from his own finger to present
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How absurd is that English jealousy about foreign decorations! I was
      obliged to decline the Red Cross of Massa which his Highness proposed to
      confer on me. A monarchy that wants to emulate a republic is simply
      ridiculous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You English are obliged to pay dear for your hypocrisies; and you ought,
      for you really love them." And with this taunt the carriage stopped at the
      door of the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Upton passed up the stairs, the waiter handed him a note, which he
      hastily opened; it was from Glencore, and in these words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Upton,&mdash;I can bear this suspense no longer; to remain here
      canvassing with myself all the doubts that beset me is a torture I cannot
      endure. I leave, therefore, at once for Florence. Once there,&mdash;where
      I mean to see and hear for myself,&mdash;I can decide what is to be the
      fate of the few days or weeks that yet remain to&mdash;Yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is gone, then,&mdash;his Lordship has started?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, your Excellency, he is by this time near Lucca, for he gave orders
      to have horses ready at all the stations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Read that, madame," said Upton, as he once more found himself alone with
      the Princess; "you will see that all your plans are disconcerted. He is
      off to Florence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Sabloukoff read the note, and threw it carelessly on the table.
      "He wants to forgive himself, and only hesitates how to do so gracefully,"
      said she, sneeringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you are less than just to him," said Upton, mildly; "his is a
      noble nature, disfigured by one grand defect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your national character, like your language, is so full of incongruities
      and contradictions that I am not ashamed to own myself unequal to master
      it; but it strikes me that both one and the other usurp freedoms that are
      not permitted to others. At all events, I am rejoiced that he has gone. It
      is the most wearisome thing in life to negotiate with one too near you.
      Diplomacy of even the humblest kind requires distance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You agree with the duellist, I perceive," said he, laughing, "that twelve
      paces is a more fatal distance than across a handkerchief: proximity
      begets tremor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have guessed my meaning correctly," said she; "meanwhile, I must
      write to <i>her</i> not to come here. Shall I say that we will be in
      Florence in a day or two?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was just thinking of those Serravezza springs," said Upton; "they
      contain a bi-chloride of potash, which Staub, in his treatise, says, 'is
      the element wanting in all nervous organizations.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But remember the season,&mdash;we are in mid-winter; the hotels are
      closed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The springs are running, Princess; 'the earth,' as Mos-chus says, 'is a
      mother that never ceases to nourish.' I do suspect I need a little
      nursing."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess understood him thoroughly. She well knew that whenever the
      affairs of Europe followed an unbroken track, without anything eventful or
      interesting, Sir Horace fell back upon his maladies for matter of
      occupation. She had, however, now occasion for his advice and counsel, and
      by no means concurred in his plan of spending some days, if not weeks, in
      the dreary mountain solitudes of Serravezza. "You must certainly consult
      Zanetti before you venture on these waters," said she; "they are highly
      dangerous if taken without the greatest circumspection;" and she gave a
      catalogue of imaginary calamities which had befallen various illustrious
      and gifted individuals, to which Upton listened with profound attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," sighed he, as she finished, "it must be as you say. I'll see
      Zanetti, for I cannot afford to die just yet. That 'Greek question' will
      have no solution without me,&mdash;no one has the key of it but myself.
      That Panslavic scheme, too, in the Principalities attracts no notice but
      <i>mine</i>; and as to Spain, the policy I have devised for that country
      requires all the watchfulness I can bestow on it. No, Princess,"&mdash;here
      he gave a melancholy sigh,&mdash;"we must not die at this moment. There
      are just four men in Europe; I doubt if she could get on with three."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What proportion do you admit as to the other sex?" said she, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only know of one, madame;" and he kissed her hand with gallantry. "And
      now for Florence, if you will."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is by no means improbable that our readers have a right to an apology
      at our hands for the habit we have indulged of lingering along with the
      two individuals whose sayings and doings are not directly essential to our
      tale; but is not the story of every-day life our guarantee that incidents
      and people cross and re-cross the path we are going, attracting our
      attention, engaging our sympathy, enlisting our energies, even in our most
      anxious periods? Such is the world; and we cannot venture out of reality.
      Besides this, we are disposed to think that the moral of a tale is often
      more effectively conveyed by the characters than by the catastrophe of a
      story. The strange, discordant tones of the human heart, blending, with
      melody the purest, sounds of passionate meaning, are in themselves more
      powerful lessons than all the records of rewarded virtue and all the
      calendars of punished vice. The nature of a single man can be far more
      instructive than the history of every accident that befalls him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, then, with regret that we leave the Princess and Sir Horace to
      pursue their journey alone. We confess a liking for their society, and
      would often as soon loiter in the by-paths that they follow as journey in
      the more recognized high-road of our true story. Not having the conviction
      that our sympathy is shared by our readers, we again return to the
      fortunes of Glencore.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lord Glencore's carriage underwent the usual scrutiny exercised
      towards travellers at the gate of Florence, and prying officials poked
      their lanterns in every quarter, in all the security of their "caste," two
      foot travellers were rudely pushed aside to await the time till the
      pretentious equipage passed on. They were foreigners, and their effects,
      which they carried in knapsacks, required examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have come a long way on foot to-day," said the younger in a tone that
      indicated nothing of one asking a favor. "Can't we have this search made
      at once?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whisht! whisht!" whispered his companion, in English; "wait till the
      Prince moves on, and be polite with them all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am seeking for nothing in the shape of compliment," said the other;
      "there is no reason why, because I am on foot, I must be detained for this
      man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the other remonstrated, and suggested patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you grumbling about, young fellow?" cried one of the officers.
      "Do you fancy yourself of the same consequence as Milordo? And see, he
      must wait his time here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We came a good way on foot to-day, sir," interposed the elder, eagerly,
      taking the reply on himself, "and we 're tired and weary, and would be
      deeply obliged if you'd examine us as soon as you could."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand aside and wait your turn," was the stern response.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You almost deserve the fellow's insolence, Billy," said the youth; "a
      crown-piece in his hand had been far more intelligible than your appeal to
      his pity." And he threw himself wearily down on a stone bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aroused by the accent of his own language, Lord Glencore sat up in his
      carriage, and leaned out to catch sight of the speaker; but the shadow of
      the overhanging roof concealed him from view. "Can't you suffer those two
      poor fellows to move on?" whispered his Lordship, as he placed a piece of
      money in the officer's hand; "they look tired and jaded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, thank his Excellency for his kindness to you, and go your way,"
      muttered the officer to Billy, who, without well understanding the words,
      drew nigh the window; but the glass was already drawn up, the postilions
      were once more in their saddles, and away dashed the cumbrous carriage in
      all the noise and uproar that is deemed the proper tribute to rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth heard that they were free to proceed, with a half-dogged
      indifference, and throwing his knapsack on his shoulders, moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I asked them if they knew one of her name in the city, and they said,
      'No,'" said the elder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But they so easily mistake names: how did you call her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said 'Harley,&mdash;la Signora Harley,'" rejoined the other; "and they
      were positive she was not here. They never heard of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we shall know soon," sighed the youth, heavily. "Is not this an
      inn, Billy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay is it, but not one for our purpose,&mdash;it's like a palace. They
      told me of the 'Leone d'Oro' as a quiet place and cheap."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care where or what it be; one day and night here will do all I
      want. And then for Genoa, Billy, and the sea, and the world beyond the
      sea," said the youth, with increasing animation. "You shall see what a
      different fellow I'll be when I throw behind me forever the traditions of
      this dreary life here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know well the good stuff that's in ye," said the other, affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, but you don't know that I have energy as well as pride," said the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's nothing beyond your reach if you will only strive to get it,"
      said he again, in the same voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're an arrant flatterer, old boy," cried the youth, throwing his arm
      around him; "but I would not have you otherwise for the world. There is a
      happiness even in the self-deception of your praise that I could not deny
      myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus chatting, they arrived at the humble door of the "Leone d'Oro," where
      they installed themselves for the night. It was a house frequented by
      couriers and <i>vetturini</i>, and at the common table for this company
      they now took their places for supper. The Carnival was just drawing to
      its close, and all the gayeties of that merry season were going forward.
      Nothing was talked of but the brilliant festivities of the city, the
      splendid balls of the Court, and the magnificent receptions in the houses
      of the nobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Palazzo della Torre takes the lead of all," said one. "There were
      upwards of three thousand masks there this evening, I 'm told, and the
      gardens were just as full as the <i>salons</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is rich enough to afford it well," cried another. "I counted twenty
      servants in white and gold liveries on the stairs alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you there, then?" asked the youth, whom we may at once call by his
      name of Massy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; a mask and a domino, such as you see yonder, are passports
      everywhere for the next twenty-four hours; and though I 'm only a courier,
      I have been chatting with duchesses, and exchanging smart sayings with
      countesses, in almost every great house in Florence this evening. The
      Pergola Theatre, too, is open, and all the boxes crowded with visitors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a stranger, as I detect by your accent," said another, "and you
      ought to have a look at a scene such as you'll never witness in your own
      land."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would come of such freedoms with us, Billy?" whispered Massy. "Would
      our great lords tolerate, even for a few hours, the association with
      honest fellows of this stamp?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There would be danger in the attempt, anyhow," said Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What calumnies would be circulated, what slanderous tales would be sent
      abroad, under cover of this secrecy! How many a coward stab would be given
      in the shadow of that immunity! For one who would use the privilege for
      mere amusement, how many would turn it to account for private vengeance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you quite certain such accidents do not occur here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That society tolerates the custom is the best answer to this. There may
      be, for aught we know, many a cruel vengeance executed under favor of this
      secrecy. Many may cover their faces to unmask their hearts; but, after
      all, they continue to observe a habit which centuries back their
      forefathers followed; and the inference fairly is, that it is not baneful.
      For my own part, I am glad to have an opportunity of witnessing these
      Saturnalia, and to-morrow I 'll buy a mask and a domino, Billy, and so
      shall you too. Why should we not have a day's fooling, like the rest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy shook his head and laughed, and they soon afterwards parted for the
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      While young Massy slept soundly, not a dream disturbing the calmness of
      his rest, Lord Glencore passed the night in a state of feverish
      excitement. Led on by some strange, mysterious influence, which he could
      as little account for as resist, he had come back to the city where the
      fatal incident of his life had occurred. With what purpose, he could not
      tell. It was not, indeed, that he had no object in view. It was rather
      that he had so many and conflicting ones that they marred and destroyed
      each other. No longer under the guidance of calm reason, his head wandered
      from the past to the present and the future, disturbed by passion and
      excited by injured self-love. At one moment, sentiments of sorrow and
      shame would take the ascendant; and at the next, a vindictive desire to
      follow out his vengeance and witness the ruin that he had accomplished.
      The unbroken, unrelieved pressure of one thought, for years and years of
      time, had at last undermined his reasoning powers; and every attempt at
      calm judgment or reflection was sure to be attended with some violent
      paroxysm of irrepressible rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are men in whom the combative element is so strong that it usurps
      all their guidance, and when once they are enlisted in a contest, they
      cannot desist till the struggle be decided for or against them. Such was
      Glencore. To discover that the terrible injury he had inflicted on his
      wife had not crushed her nor driven her with shame from the world, aroused
      once more all the vindictive passions of his nature. It was a defiance he
      could not withstand. Guilty or innocent, it mattered not; she had braved
      him,&mdash;at least so he was told,&mdash;and as such he had come to see
      her with his own eyes. If this was the thought which predominated in his
      mind, others there were that had their passing power over him,&mdash;moments
      of tenderness, moments in which the long past came back again, full of
      softening memories; and then he would burst into tears and cry bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he ventured to project any plan for reconciliation with her he had so
      cruelly wronged, he as suddenly bethought him that her spirit was not less
      high and haughty than his own. She had, so far as he could learn, never
      quailed before his vengeance; how, then, might he suppose would she act in
      the presence of his avowed injustice? Was it not, besides, too late to
      repair the wrong? Even for his boy's sake, would it not be better if he
      inherited sufficient means to support an honorable life, unknown and
      unnoticed, than bequeath to him a name so associated with shame and
      sorrow?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who can tell," he would cry aloud, "what my harsh treatment may not have
      made him? what resentment may have taken root in his young heart? what
      distrust may have eaten into his nature? If I could but see him and talk
      with him as a stranger,&mdash;if I could be able to judge him apart from
      the influences that my own feelings would create,&mdash;even then, what
      would it avail me? I have so sullied and tarnished a proud name that he
      could never bear it without reproach. 'Who is this Lord Glencore?' people
      would say. 'What is the strange story of his birth? Has any one yet got at
      the truth? Was the father the cruel tyrant, or the mother the worthless
      creature, we hear tell of? Is he even legitimate, and, if so, why does he
      walk apart from his equals, and live without recognition by his order?'
      This is the noble heritage I am to leave him,&mdash;this the proud
      position to which he is to succeed! And yet Upton says that the boy's
      rights are inalienable; that, think how I may, do what I will, the day on
      which I die, he is the rightful Lord Glencore. His claim may lie dormant,
      the proofs may be buried, but that, in truth and fact, he will be what all
      my subterfuge and all my falsehood cannot deny him. And then, if the day
      should come that he asserts his right,&mdash;if, by some of those
      wonderful accidents that reveal the mysteries of the world, he should
      succeed to prove his claim,&mdash;what a memory will he cherish of <i>me!</i>
      Will not every sorrow of his youth, every indignity of his manhood, be
      associated with my name? Will he or can he ever forgive him who defamed
      the mother and despoiled the son?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the terrible conflict of such thoughts as these he passed the night;
      intervals of violent grief or passion alone breaking the sad connection of
      such reflections, till at length the worn-out faculties, incapable of
      further exercise, wandered away into incoherency, and he raved in all the
      wildness of insanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was thus that Upton found him on his arrival.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LII. MAJOR SCARESBY'S VISIT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Down the crowded thoroughfare of the Borgo d' Ognisanti the tide of
      Carnival mummers poured unceasingly. Hideous masks and gay dominos,
      ludicrous impersonations and absurd satires on costume, abounded, and the
      entire population seemed to have given themselves up to merriment, and
      were fooling it to the top o' their bent. Bands of music and
      chorus-singers from the theatre filled the air with their loud strains,
      and carriages crowded with fantastic figures moved past, pelting the
      bystanders with mock sweetmeats, and covering them with showers of flour.
      It was a season of universal license, and, short of actual outrage, all
      was permitted for the time. Nor did the enjoyment of the scene seem to be
      confined to the poorer classes of the people, who thus for the nonce
      assumed equality with their richer neighbors; but all, even to the very
      highest, mixed in the wild excitement of the pageant, and took the rough
      treatment they met with in perfect good-humor. Dukes and princes, white
      from head to foot with the snowy shower, went laughingly along, and grave
      dignitaries were fain to walk arm-inarm with the most ludicrous
      monstrosities, whose gestures turned on them the laughter of all around.
      Occasionally&mdash;but, it must be owned, rarely&mdash;some philosopher of
      a sterner school might be seen passing hurriedly along, his severe
      features and contemptuous glances owning to little sympathy with the
      mummery about him; but even <i>he</i> had to compromise his proud disdain,
      and escape, as best he might, from the indiscriminate justice of the
      crowd. To detect one of this stamp, to follow, and turn upon him the full
      tide of popular fury, seemed to be the greatest triumph of the scene. When
      such a victim presented himself, all joined in the pursuit: nuns embraced,
      devils environed him, angels perched on his shoulders, mock wild boars
      rushed between his legs; his hat was decorated with feathers, his clothes
      inundated with showers of meal or flour; hackney-coachmen, dressed as
      ladies, fainted in his arms, and semi-naked bacchanals pressed drink to
      his lips. In a word, each contributed what he might of attention to the
      luckless individual, whose resistance&mdash;if he were so impolitic as to
      make any&mdash;only increased the zest of the persecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instance of this kind had now attracted general attention, nor was the
      amusement diminished by the discovery that he was a foreigner and an
      Englishman. Impertinent allusions to his nation, absurd attempts at his
      language, ludicrous travesties of what were supposed to be his native
      customs, were showered on him, in company with a hailstorm of mock bonbons
      and lime-pellets; till, covered with powder, and outraged beyond all
      endurance, he fought his way into the entrance of the Hôtel d'Italie,
      followed by the cries and laughter of the populace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cursed tomfoolery! Confounded asses!" cried he, as he found himself in a
      harbor of refuge. "What the devil fun can they discover in making each
      other dirtier than their daily habits bespeak them? I say," cried he,
      addressing a waiter, "is Sir Horace Upton staying here? Well, will you say
      Major Scaresby&mdash;be correct in the name&mdash;Major Scaresby requests
      to pay his respects."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His Excellency will see you, sir," said the man, returning quickly with
      the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the end of a room, so darkened by closed shutters and curtains as to
      make all approach difficult, a weak voice called out, "Ah, Scaresby, how
      d' ye do? I was just thinking to myself that I could n't be in Florence,
      since I had not seen you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are too good, too kind, Sir Horace, to say so," said the other, with
      a voice whose tones by no means corresponded with the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Scaresby, everything in this good city is in a manner associated
      with your name. Its intrigues, its quarrels, its loves and jealousies, its
      mysteries, in fine, have had no such interpreter as yourself within the
      memory of man! What a pity there were no Scaresbys in the Cinque Cento!
      How sad there were none of your family here in the Medician period! What a
      picture might we then have had of a society fuller even than the present
      of moral delinquencies." There was a degree of pomposity in the manner he
      uttered this that served to conceal in a great measure its sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am much flattered to learn that I have ever enlightened your Excellency
      on any subject," said the Major, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you have, Scaresby. I was a mere dabbler in moral toxicology when I
      heard your first lecture, and, I assure you, I was struck by your
      knowledge. And how is the dear city doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is masquerading to-day," said Scaresby, "and, consequently, far more
      natural than at any other period of the whole year. Smeared faces and
      dirty finery,&mdash;exactly its suitable wear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are here, Major? Any one that one knows?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old Millington is here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Marquis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he 's here, fresh painted and lacquered; his eyes twinkling with a
      mock lustre that makes him look like an old po'-chaise with a pair of new
      lamps!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Sir Horace, encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then&mdash;there's Mabworth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Paul Mabworth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, the same old bore as ever! He has got off one of Burke's speeches on
      the India Bill by heart, and says that he spoke it on the question of the
      grant for Maynooth. Oh, if poor Burke could only look up!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look down! you ought to say, Scaresby; depend upon't, he 's not on the
      Opposition benches still!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hate the fellow," said Scaresby, whose ill-temper was always augmented
      by any attempted smartness of those he conversed with. "He has taken
      Walmsley's cook away from him, and never gives any one a dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is shameful; a perfect dog in the manger!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Worse; he 's a dog without any manger! For he keeps his house on
      board-wages, and there's literally nothing to eat! That poor thing,
      Strejowsky."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Olga Strejowsky, do you mean? What of her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, there's another husband just turned up. They thought he was killed
      in the Caucasus, but he was only passing a few years in Siberia; and so he
      has come back, and claims all the emeralds. You remember, of course, that
      famous necklace, and the great drops! They belonged once to the Empress
      Catherine, but Mabworth says that he took the concern with all its
      dependencies; he 'll give up his bargain, but make no compromise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's growing old, I fancy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's younger than the Sabloukoff by five good years, and they tell me <i>she</i>
      plays Beauty to this hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, Scaresby, had you known what words were these you have just uttered,
      or had you only seen the face of him who heard them, you had rather bitten
      your tongue off than suffered it to fashion them!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brignolles danced with her at that celebrated <i>fête</i> given by the
      Prince of Orleans something like eight-and-thirty years ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how is the dear Duke?" asked Upton, sharply.

      "Just as you saw him at the Court of Louis XVIII.; he swaggers a little
      more as he gets more feeble about the legs, and he shows his teeth when he
      laughs, more decidedly since his last journey to Paris. Devilish clever
      fellows these modern dentists are! He wants to marry; I suppose you 've
      heard it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a word of it. Who is the happy fair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Nina, as they call her now. She was one of the Delia Torres, who
      married, or didn't marry, Glencore. Don't you remember him? He was Colonel
      of the Eleventh, and a devil of a martinet he was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember him," said Upton, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he ran off with one of those girls, and some say they were married
      at Capri,&mdash;as if it signified what happened at Capri! She was a
      deuced good-looking girl at the time,&mdash;a coquette, you know,&mdash;and
      Glencore was one of those stiff English fellows that think every man is
      making up to his wife; he drank besides."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, pardon me, there you are mistaken. I knew him intimately; Glencore
      was as temperate as myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have it from Lowther, who used to take him home at night; <i>he</i>
      said Glencore never went to bed sober! At all events, she hated him, and
      detested his miserly habits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another mistake, my dear Major. Glencore was never what is called a rich
      man, but he was always a generous one!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you'll not deny that he used to thrash her? Ay, and with a
      horsewhip too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, Scaresby; this is really too coarse for mere jesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jest? By Jove! it was very bitter earnest. She told Brignolles all about
      it. I 'm not sure she didn't show him the marks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take my word for it, Scaresby," said Upton, dropping his voice to a low
      but measured tone, "this is a base calumny, and the Duke of Brignolles no
      more circulated such a story than I did. He is a man of honor, and utterly
      incapable of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can only repeat that I believe it to be perfectly true!" said Scaresby,
      calmly. "Nobody here ever doubted the story."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot say what measure of charity accompanies your zeal for truth in
      this amiable society, Scaresby, but I can repeat my assertion that this
      must be a falsehood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will find it very hard, nevertheless, to bring any one over to your
      opinion," retorted the unappeasable Major. "He was a fellow everybody
      hated; proud and supercilious to all, and treated his wife's relations&mdash;who
      were of far better blood than himself&mdash;as though they were <i>canaille</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud crash, as if of something heavy having fallen, here interrupted
      their colloquy, and Upton sprang from his seat and hastened into the
      adjoining room. Close beside the door&mdash;so close that he almost fell
      over it in entering&mdash;lay the figure of Lord Glencore. In his efforts
      to reach the door he had fainted, and there he lay,&mdash;a cold, clammy
      sweat covering his livid features, and his bloodless lips slightly parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost an hour ere his consciousness returned; but when it did, and
      he saw Upton alone at his bedside, he pressed his hand within his own, and
      said, "I heard it all, Upton, every word! I tried to reach the room; I got
      out of bed&mdash;and was already at the door&mdash;when my brain reeled,
      and my heart grew faint It may have been malady, it might be passion,&mdash;I
      know not; but I saw no more. He is gone,&mdash;is he not?" cried he, in a
      faint whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes,&mdash;an hour ago; but you will think nothing of what he said,
      when I tell you his name. It was Scaresby,&mdash;Major Scaresby; one whose
      bad tongue is the one solitary claim by which he subsists in a society of
      slanderers!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he is gone!" repeated the other, in a tone of deep despondency.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course he is. I never saw him since; but be assured of what I have
      just told you, that his libels carry no reproach. He is a calumniator by
      temperament."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'd have shot him, if I could have opened the door," muttered Glencore
      between his teeth; but Upton heard the words distinctly. "What am I to
      this man," cried he, aloud, "or he to me, that I am to be arraigned by him
      on charges of any kind, true or false? What accident of fortune makes him
      my judge? Tell me that, sir. Who has appealed to him for protection? Who
      has demanded to be righted at his hand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you not hear me, Glencore, when I say that his slanders have no
      sting? In the circles wherein he mixes, it is the mere scandal that
      amuses; for its veracity, there is not one that cares. You, or I, or some
      one else, supply the name of an actor in a disreputable drama, the plot of
      which alone interests, not the performer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And am I to sit tamely down under this degradation?" exclaimed Glencore,
      passionately. "I have never subscribed to this dictation. There is little,
      indeed, of life left to me, but there is enough, perhaps, to vindicate
      myself against men of this stamp. You shall take him a message from me;
      you shall tell him by what accident I overheard his discoveries."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Glencore, there are graver interests, far worthier cares, than
      any this man's name can enter into, which should now engage you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say he shall have my provocation, and that within an hour!" cried
      Glencore, wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would give this man and his words a consequence that neither have
      ever possessed," said Upton, in a mild and subdued tone. "Remember,
      Glencore, when I left with you this morning that paper of Stubber's it was
      with a distinct understanding that other and wiser thoughts than those of
      vengeance were to occupy your attention. I never scrupled to place it in
      your hands; I never hesitated about confiding to you what in a lawyer's
      phrase would be a proof against you. When an act of justice was to be
      done, I would not stain it by the faintest shadow of coercion. I left you
      free, I leave you still free, from everything but the dictates of your own
      honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glencore made no reply, but the conflict of his thoughts seemed to agitate
      him greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man who has pursued a false path in life," said Upton, calmly, "has
      need of much courage to retrace his steps; but courage is not the quality
      you fail in, Glencore, so that I appeal to you with confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have need of courage," muttered Glencore; "you say truly. What was it
      the doctor said this morning,&mdash;aneurism?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Upton moved his head with an inclination barely perceptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a Nemesis there is in nature," said Glencore, with a sickly attempt
      to smile, "that passion should beget malady! I never knew, physically
      speaking, that I had a heart&mdash;till it was broken. So that," resumed
      he, in a more agreeable tone, "death may ensue at any moment&mdash;on the
      least excitement?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He warned you gravely on that point," said Upton, cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How strange that I should have come through that trial of an hour ago! It
      was not that the struggle did not move me. I could have torn that fellow
      limb from limb, Upton, if I had but the strength! But see," cried he,
      feebly, "what a poor wretch I am; I cannot close these fingers!" and he
      held out a worn and clammy hand as he spoke. "Do with me as you will,"
      said he, after a pause; "I ought to have followed your counsels long ago!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Upton was too subtle an anatomist of human motives to venture by even the
      slightest word to disturb a train of thought which any interference could
      only damage. As the other still continued to meditate, and, by his manner
      and look, in a calmer and more reflective spirit, the wily diplomatist
      moved noiselessly away, and left him alone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIII. A MASK IN CARNIVAL TIME
    </h2>
    <p>
      From the gorgeous halls of the Pitti Palace down to the humblest chamber
      in Camaldole, Florence was a scene of rejoicing. As night closed in, the
      crowds seemed only to increase, and the din and clamor to grow louder. It
      seemed as though festivity and joy had overflowed from the houses, filling
      the streets with merry-makers. In the clear cold air, groups feasted, and
      sang, and danced, all mingling and intermixing with a freedom that showed
      how thoroughly the spirit of pleasure-seeking can annihilate the
      distinctions of class. The soiled and tattered mummer leaned over the
      carriage-door and exchanged compliments with the masked duchess within.
      The titled noble of a dozen quarterings stopped to pledge a merry company
      who pressed him to drain a glass of Monte Pulciano with them. There was a
      perfect fellowship between those whom fortune had so widely separated, and
      the polished accents of high society were heard to blend with the quaint
      and racy expressions of the "people."
    </p>
    <p>
      Theatres and palaces lay open, all lighted "<i>a giorno</i>." The whole
      population of the city surged and swayed to and fro like a mighty sea in
      motion, making the air resound the while with a wild mixture of sounds,
      wherein music and laughter were blended. Amid the orgie, however, not an
      act, not a word of rudeness, disturbed the general content. It was a
      season of universal joy, and none dared to destroy the spell of pleasure
      that presided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our task is not to follow the princely equipages as they rolled in
      unceasing tides within the marble courts, nor yet to track the strong
      flood that poured through the wide thoroughfares in all the wildest
      exuberance of their joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our business is with two travellers, who, well weary of being for hours
      a-foot, and partly sated with pleasure, sat down to rest themselves on a
      bench beside the Arno.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is glorious fooling, that must be owned, Billy," said Charles Massy,
      "and the spirit is most contagious. How little have you or I in common
      with these people! We scarce can catch the accents of the droll allusions,
      we cannot follow the strains of their rude songs, and yet we are carried
      away like the rest to feel a wild enjoyment in all this din, and glitter,
      and movement. How well they do it, too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all by rayson of concentration," said 'Billy, gravely. "They are
      highly charged with fun. The ould adage says, 'Non semper sunt
      Saturnalia,'&mdash;It is not every day Morris kills a cow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet it is by this very habit of enjoyment that they know how to be
      happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure it is," cried Billy; "<i>they</i> have a ritual for it which
      <i>we</i> have n't; as Cicero tells us, 'In jucundis nullum periculum.'
      But ye see we have no notion of any amusement without a dash of danger
      through it, if not even cruelty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The French know how to reconcile the two natures; they are brave, and
      light-hearted too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the Irish, Mister Charles,&mdash;the Irish especially," said Billy,
      proudly; "for I was alludin' to the English in what I said last. The
      'versatile ingenium' is all our own.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     He goes into a tent and he spends half a-crown,
     Comes out, meets a friend, and for love knocks him down.
</pre>
    <p>
      There 's an elegant philosophy in that, now, that a Saxon would never see!
      For it is out of the very fulness of the heart, ye may remark, that Pat
      does this, just as much as to say, 'I don't care for the expense!' He
      smashes a skull just as he would a whole dresser of crockery-ware! There's
      something very grand in that recklessness."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone of the remark, and a certain wild energy of his manner, showed
      that poor Billy's faculties were slightly under the influences of the
      Tuscan grape; and the youth smiled at sight of an excess so rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How hard it must be," said Massy, "to go back to the workaday routine of
      life after one of these outbursts,&mdash;to resume not alone the drudgery,
      but all the slavish observances that humble men yield to great ones!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis what Bacon says, 'There's nothing so hard as unlearnin' anything;'
      and the proof is how few of us ever do it! We always go on mucin' old
      thoughts with new,&mdash;puttin' different kinds of wine into the same
      glass, and then wonderin' we are not invigorated!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 're in a mood for moralizing to-night, I see, Billy," said the other,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The levities of life always puts me on that thrack, just as too bright a
      day reminds me to take out an umbrella with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet I do not see that all your observation of the world has indisposed
      you to enjoy it, or that you take harsher views of life the closer you
      look at it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite the reverse; the more I see of mankind, the more I 'm struck with
      the fact that the very wickedest and worst can't get rid of remorse! 'Tis
      something out of a man's nature entirely&mdash;something that dwells
      outside of him&mdash;sets him on to commit a crime; and then he begins to
      rayson and dispute with the temptation, just like one keepin' bad company,
      and listenin' to impure notions and evil suggestions day after day; as he
      does this, he gets to have a taste for that kind of low society,&mdash;I
      mane with his own bad thoughts,&mdash;till at last every other ceases to
      amuse him. Look! what's that there; where are they goin' with all the
      torches there?" cried he, suddenly, springing up and pointing to a dense
      crowd that passed along the street. It was a band of music, dressed in a
      quaint mediaeval costume, on its way to serenade some palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us follow and listen to them, Billy," said the youth; and they arose
      and joined the throng.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following in the wake of the dense mass, they at last reached the gates of
      a great palace, and after some waiting gained access to the spacious
      courtyard. The grim old statues and armorial bearings shone in the glare
      of a hundred torches, and the deep echoes rang with the brazen voices of
      the band as, pent up within the quadrangle, the din of a large orchestra
      arose. On a great terrace overhead numerous figures were grouped,&mdash;indistinctly
      seen from the light of the <i>salons</i> within,&mdash;but whose
      mysterious movements completed the charm of a very interesting picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some wrapped in shawls to shroud them from the night air, some, less
      cautiously emerging from the rooms within, leaned over the marble
      balustrade and showed their jewelled arms in the dim hazy light, while
      around and about them gay uniforms and costumes abounded. As Billy gave
      himself up to the excitement of the music, young Massy, more interested by
      the aspect of the scene, gazed unceasingly at the balcony. There was just
      that shadowy indistinctness in the whole that invested it with a kind of
      romantic interest, and he could weave stories and incidents from those
      whose figures passed and repassed before him. He fancied that in their
      gestures he could trace many meanings, and as the bent-down heads
      approached, and their hands touched, he fashioned many a tale in his own
      mind of moving fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And see, she comes again to that same dark angle of the terrace,"
      muttered he to himself, as, shrouded in a large mantle and with a half
      mask on her features, a tall and graceful figure passed into the place he
      spoke of. "She looks like one among, but not of, them. How much of
      heart-weariness is there in that attitude; how full is it of sad and
      tender melancholy! Would that I could see her face! My life on't that it
      is beautiful! There, she is tearing up her bouquet; leaf by leaf the
      rose-leaves are falling, as though one by one hopes are decaying in her
      heart." He pushed his way through the dense throng till he gained a corner
      of the court where a few leaves and flower-stems yet strewed the ground;
      carefully gathering up these, he crushed them in his hand, and seemed to
      feel as though a nearer tie bound him to the fair unknown. How little
      ministers to the hope; how infinitely less again will feed the imagination
      of a young heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      Between them now there was, to his appreciation, some mysterious link.
      "Yes," he said to himself, "true, I stand unknown, unnoticed; yet it is to
      <i>me</i> of all the thousands here she could reveal what is passing in
      that heart! I know it, I feel it! She has a sorrow whose burden I might
      help to bear. There is cruelty, or treachery, or falsehood arrayed against
      her; and through all the splendor of the scene&mdash;all the wild gayety
      of the orgie&mdash;some spectral image never leaves her side! I would
      stake existence on it that I have read her aright!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the intoxications that can entrance the human faculties, there is
      none so maddening as that produced by giving full sway to an exuberant
      imagination. The bewilderment resists every effort of reason, and in its
      onward course carries away its victims with all the force of a mountain
      torrent. A winding stair, long unused and partly dilapidated, led to the
      end of the terrace where she stood, and Massy, yielding to some strange
      impulse, slowly and noiselessly crept up this till he gained a spot only a
      few yards removed from her. The dark shadow of the building almost
      completely concealed his figure, and left him free to contemplate her
      unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some event of interest within had withdrawn all from the terrace save
      herself; the whole balcony was suddenly deserted, and she alone remained,
      to all seeming lost to the scene around her. It was then that she removed
      her mask, and suffering it to fall back on her neck, rested her head
      pensively on her hand. Massy bent over eagerly to try and catch sight of
      her face; the effort he made startled her, she looked round, and he cried
      out, "Ida&mdash;Ida! My heart could not deceive me!" In another instant he
      had climbed the balcony and was beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought we had parted forever, Sebastian," said she; "you told me so on
      the last night at Massa."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so I meant when I said it," cried he; "nor is our meeting now of my
      planning. I came to Florence, it is true, to see, but not to speak with
      you, ere I left Europe forever. For three entire days I have searched the
      city to discover where you lived, and chance&mdash;I have no better name
      for it&mdash;chance has led me hither."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is an unkind fortune that has made us meet again," said she, in a
      voice of deep melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never known fortune in any other mood," said he, fiercely. "When
      clouds show me the edge of their silver linings, I only prepare myself for
      storm and hurricane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know you have endured much," said she, in a voice of deeper sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know but little of what I have endured," rejoined he, sternly. "You
      saw me taunted, indeed, with my humble calling, insulted for my low birth,
      expelled ignominiously from a house where my presence had been sought for;
      and yet all these, grievous enough, are little to other evils I have had
      to bear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By what unhappy accident, what mischance, have you made <i>her</i> your
      enemy, Sebastian? She would not even suffer me to speak to you. She went
      so far as to tell me that there was a reason for the dislike,&mdash;one
      which, if she could reveal, I would never question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can I tell?" cried he, angrily. "I was born, I suppose, under an evil
      star; for nothing prospers with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But can you even guess her reasons?" said she, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, except it be the presumption of one in <i>my</i> condition daring to
      aspire to one in <i>yours</i>; and that, as the world goes, would be
      reason enough. It is probable, too, that I did not state these pretensions
      of mine over delicately. I told her, with a frankness that was not quite
      acceptable, I was one who could not speak of birth or blood. She did not
      like the coarse word I applied to myself, and I will not repeat it; and
      she ventured to suggest that, had there not appeared some ambiguity in her
      own position, <i>I</i> could never have so far forgotten mine as to
      advance such pretensions&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, and then?" cried the girl, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, and then," said he, deliberately, "I told her I had heard rumors of
      the kind she alluded to, but to <i>me</i> they carried no significance;
      that it was for <i>you</i> I cared. The accidents of life around you had
      no influence on my choice; you might be all that the greatest wealth and
      highest blood could make you, or as poor and ignoble as myself, without
      any change in my affections. 'These,' said she, 'are the insulting
      promptings of that English breeding which you say has mixed with your
      blood, and if for no other cause would make me distrust you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Stained as it may be,' said I, 'that same English blood is the best
      pride I possess.' She grew pale with passion as I said this, but never
      spoke a word; and there we stood, staring haughtily at each other, till
      she pointed to the door, and so I left her. And now, Ida, who is she that
      treats me thus disdainfully? I ask you not in anger, for I know too well
      how the world regards such as me to presume to question its harsh
      injustice. But tell me, I beseech you, that she is one to whose station
      these prejudices are the fitting accompaniments, and let me feel that it
      is less myself as the individual that she wrongs, than the class I belong
      to is that which she despises. I can better bear this contumely when I
      know that it is an instinct."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If birth and blood can justify a prejudice, a Princess of the house of
      Delia Torre might claim the privilege," said the girl, haughtily. "No
      family of the North, at least, will dispute with our own in lineage; but
      there are other causes which may warrant all that she feels towards you
      even more strongly, Sebastian. This boast of your English origin, this it
      is which has doubtless injured you in her esteem. Too much reason has she
      had to cherish the antipathy! Betrayed into a secret marriage by an
      Englishman who represented himself as of a race noble as her own, she was
      deserted and abandoned by him afterwards. This is the terrible mystery
      which I never dared to tell you, and which led us to a life of seclusion
      at Massa. This is the source of that hatred towards all of a nation which
      she must ever associate with the greatest misfortunes of her life! And
      from this unhappy event was she led to make me take that solemn oath that
      I spoke of, never to link my fortunes with one of that hated land."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you told me that you had not made the pledge," said he, wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor had I then, Sebastian; but since we last met, worked on by
      solicitation, I could not resist; tortured by a narrative of such sorrows
      as I never listened to before, I yielded, and gave my promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It matters little to <i>me!</i>" said he, gloomily; "a barrier the more
      or the less can be of slight moment when there rolls a wide sea between
      us! Had you ever loved me, such a pledge had been impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was you yourself, Sebastian, told me we were never to meet again,"
      rejoined she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better that we had never done so!" muttered he. "Nay, perhaps I am
      wrong," added he, fiercely; "this meeting may serve to mark how little
      there ever was between us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this cruelty affected, Sebastian, or is it real?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It cannot be cruel to echo your own words. Besides," said he, with an air
      of mockery in the words, "she who lives in this gorgeous palace,
      surrounded with all the splendors of life, can have little complaint to
      make against the cruelty of fortune!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How unlike yourself is all this!" cried she. "You of all I have ever seen
      or known, understood how to rise above the accidents of fate, placing your
      happiness and your ambitions in a sphere where mere questions of wealth
      never entered. What can have so changed you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he could reply, a sudden movement in the crowd beneath attracted
      the attention of both, and a number of persons who had filled the terrace
      now passed hurriedly into the <i>salons</i>, where, to judge from the
      commotion, an event of some importance had occurred. Ida lost not a moment
      in entering, when she was met by the words: "It is she, Nina herself is
      ill; some mask&mdash;a stranger, it would seem&mdash;has said something or
      threatened something." In fact, she had been carried to her room in strong
      convulsions; and while some were in search of medical aid for her, others,
      not less eagerly, were endeavoring to detect the delinquent.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the gay and brilliant picture of festivity which was presented but a
      few minutes back, what a change now came over the scene! Many hurried away
      at once, shocked at even a momentary shadow on the sunny road of their
      existence; others as anxiously pressed on to recount the incident
      elsewhere; some, again, moved by curiosity or some better prompting,
      exerted themselves to investigate what amounted to a gross violation of
      the etiquette of a carnival; and thus, in the <i>salons</i>, on the
      stairs, and in the court itself, the greatest bustle and confusion
      prevailed. At length some suggested that the gate of the palace should be
      closed, and none suffered to depart without unmasking. The motion was at
      once adopted, and a small knot of persons, the friends of the Countess,
      assumed the task of the scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite complaints and remonstrances as to the inconvenience and delay
      thus occasioned, they examined every carriage as it passed out. None,
      however, but faces familiar to the Florentine world were to be met with;
      the well-known of every ball and <i>fête</i> were there, and if a stranger
      presented himself, he was sure to be one for whom some acquaintance could
      bear testimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a fire in one of the smaller <i>salons</i> stood a small group, of
      which the Duc de Brignolles and Major Scaresby formed a part. Sentiments
      of a very different order had detained these two individuals, and while
      the former was deeply moved by the insult offered to the Countess, the
      latter felt an intense desire to probe the circumstance to the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Devilish odd it is!" cried Scaresby; "here we have been this last hour
      and a half turning a whole house out of the windows, and yet there's no
      one to tell us what it's all for, what it 's all about!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon, monsieur," said the Duke, severely. "We know that a lady whose
      hospitality we have been accepting has retired from her company insulted.
      It is very clearly our duty that this should not pass unpunished."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oughtn't we to have some clearer insight into what constituted the
      insult? It may have been a practical joke,&mdash;a <i>mauvaise
      plaisanterie</i>, Duke."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have no claim to any confidence not extended to us, sir," said the
      Frenchman. "To me it is quite sufficient that the Countess feels
      aggrieved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not but we shall cut an absurd figure to-morrow, when we own that we
      don't know what we were so indignant about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only so many of us as have characters for the 'latest intelligence.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      To this sally there succeeded a somewhat awkward pause, Scaresby occupying
      himself with thoughts of some perfectly safe vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shouldn't wonder if it was that Count Marsano&mdash;that fellow who
      used to be about the Nina long ago&mdash;come back again. He was at Como
      this summer, and made many inquiries after his old love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A most insulting stare of defiance was the only reply the old Duke could
      make to what he would have been delighted to resent as a personal affront.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marsano is a <i>mauvais drôle</i>," said a Russian; "and if a woman
      slighted him, or he suspected that she did, he's the very man to execute a
      vengeance of the kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should apply a harsher epithet to a man capable of such conduct," said
      the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He 'd not take it patiently, Duke," said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is precisely in that hope, sir, that I should employ it," said the
      Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again was the conversation assuming a critical turn, and again an interval
      of ominous silence succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is but one carriage now in the court, your Excellency," said the
      servant, addressing the Duke in a low voice, "and the gentleman inside
      appears to be seriously ill. It might be better, perhaps, not to detain
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not," said the Duke; "but stay, I will go down myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      There were still a considerable number of persons on foot in the court
      when the Duke descended, but only one equipage remained,&mdash;a hired
      carriage,&mdash;at the open door of which a servant was standing, holding
      a glass of water for his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I be of any use to your master?" said the Duke, approaching. "Is he
      ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear he has burst a blood-vessel, sir," said the man. "He is too weak
      to answer me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is it,&mdash;what 's his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not able to tell you, sir; I only accompanied him from the hotel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us have a doctor at once; he appears to be dying," said the Duke, as
      he placed his fingers on the sick man's wrist. "Let some one go for a
      physician."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is one here," cried a voice. "I'm a doctor;" and Billy Traynor
      pushed his way to the spot. "Come, Master Charles, get into the coach and
      help me to lift him out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Massy obeyed, and not without difficulty they succeeded at last in
      disengaging the almost lifeless form of a man whose dark domino was
      perfectly saturated with fresh blood; his half mask still covered his
      face, and, to screen his features from the vulgar gaze of the crowd, they
      suffered it to remain there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up the wide stairs and into a spacious <i>salon</i> they now carried the
      figure, whose drooping head and hanging limbs gave little signs of life.
      They placed him on a sofa, and Traynor, with a ready hand, untied the mask
      and removed it. "Merciful Heavens," cried he, "it's my Lord himself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth bent down, gazed for a few seconds at the corpse-like face, and
      fell fainting to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord Glencore himself!" said the Duke, who was himself an old and
      attached friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! not a word," whispered Traynor; "he 's rallyin'&mdash;he 's comin'
      to; don't utter a syllable."
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and languidly the dying man raised his eyelids, and gazed at each
      of those around him. From their faces he turned his gaze to the chamber,
      viewing the walls and the ceiling all in turn; and then, in an accent
      barely audible, he said, "Where am I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amongst friends, who love and will cherish you, dear Glencore," said the
      Duke, affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Brignolles, I remember you. And this,&mdash;who is this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Traynor, my Lord,&mdash;Billy Traynor, that will never leave you while he
      can serve you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whose tears are those upon my hand,&mdash;I feel them hot and burning,"
      said the sick man; and Billy stepped back, that the light should fall upon
      the figure that knelt beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't cry, poor fellow," said Glencore; "it must be a hard world, or you
      have many better and dearer friends than I could have ever been to you.
      Who is this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy tried, but could not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell him, if you know who it is; see how wild and excited it has made
      him," cried the Duke; for, stretching out both hands, Glencore had caught
      the boy's face on either side, and continued to gaze on it, in wild
      eagerness. "It' is&mdash;it is!" cried he, pressing it to his bosom, and
      kissing the forehead over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom does he fancy it? Whom does he suspect?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is&mdash;look, Brignolles," cried the dying man, in a voice already
      thick with a death-rattle,&mdash;"this is the seventh Lord Viscount
      Glencore. I declare it. And now&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell back, and never spoke more. A single shudder shook his feeble
      frame, and he was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have had occasion once before in this veracious history to speak of the
      polite oblivion Florentine society so well understands to throw over the
      course of events which might cloud, even for a moment, the sunny surface
      of its enjoyment. No people, so far as we know, have greater gifts in this
      way; to shroud the disagreeables of life in decent shadow&mdash;to ignore
      or forget them is their grand prerogative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely, therefore, had three weeks elapsed, than the terrible
      catastrophe at the Palazzo della Torre was totally consigned to the
      bygones; it ceased to be thought or spoken of, and was as much matter of
      remote history as an incident in the times of one of the Medici. Too much
      interested in the future to waste time on the past, they launched into
      speculations as to whether the Countess would be likely to marry again;
      what change the late event might effect in the amount of her fortune; and
      how far her position in the world might be altered by the incident. He
      who, in the ordinary esteem of society, would have felt less acutely than
      his neighbors for Glencore's sad fate,&mdash;Upton,&mdash;was in reality
      deeply and sincerely affected. The traits which make a consummate man of
      the world&mdash;one whose prerogative it is to appreciate others, and be
      able to guide and influence their actions&mdash;are, in truth, very high
      and rare gifts, and imply resources of fine sentiment as fully as stores
      of intellectual wealth. Upton sorrowed over Glencore as for one whose
      noble nature had been poisoned by an impetuous temper, and over whose best
      instincts an ungovernable self-esteem had ever held the mastery. They had
      been friends almost from boyhood, and the very worldliest of men can feel
      the bitterness of that isolation in which the "turn of life" too
      frequently commences. Such friendships are never made in later life. We
      lend our affections when young on very small security, and though it is
      true we are occasionally unfortunate, we do now and then make a safe
      investment. No men are more prone to attach an exaggerated value to early
      friendships than those who, stirred by strong ambitions, and animated by
      high resolves, have played for the great stakes in the world's lottery.
      Too much immersed in the cares and contests of life to find time to
      contract close personal attachments, they fall back upon the memory of
      school or college days to supply the want of their hearts. There is a
      sophistry, too, that seduces them to believe that then, at least, they
      were loved for what they were, for qualities of their nature, not for
      accidents of station, or the proud rewards of success. There is also
      another and a very strange element in the pleasure such memories afford.
      Our early attachments serve as points of departure by which we measure the
      distance we have travelled in life. "Ay," say we, "we were schoolfellows;
      I remember how he took the lead of me in this or that science, how far
      behind he left me in such a thing; and yet look at us now!" Upton had very
      often to fall back upon similar recollections; neither his school nor his
      college life had been remarkable for distinction; but it was always
      perceived that every attainment he achieved was such as would be available
      in after life. Nor did he ever burden himself with the toils of
      scholarship while there lay within his reach stores of knowledge that
      might serve to contest the higher and greater prizes that he had already
      set before his ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let us return to himself as, alone and sorrow-struck, he sat in his
      room of the Hôtel d'Italie. Various cares and duties consequent on
      Glencore's death had devolved entirely upon him. Young Massy had suddenly
      disappeared from Florence on the morning after the funeral, and was seen
      no more, and Upton was the only one who could discharge any of the
      necessary duties of such a moment. The very nature of the task thus
      imposed upon him had its own depressing influence on his mind; the gloomy
      pomp of death&mdash;the terrible companionship between affliction and
      worldliness&mdash;the tear of the mourner&mdash;the heart-broken sigh
      drowned in the sharp knock of the coffin-maker. He had gone through it
      all, and sat moodily pondering over the future, when Madame de Sabloukoff
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She 's much better this morning, and I think we can go over and dine with
      her to-day," said she, removing her shawl and taking a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a little easy smile that seemed assent, but did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I perceive you have not opened your letters this morning," said she,
      turning towards the table, littered over with letters and despatches of
      every size and shape! "This seems to be from the King,&mdash;is that his
      mode of writing 'G. R.' in the corner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is," said Upton, faintly. "Will you be kind enough to read it for
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pavilion, Brighton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Upton,&mdash;Let me be the first to congratulate you on an
      appointment which it affords me the greatest pleasure to confirm&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does he allude to?" cried she, stopping suddenly, while a slight
      tinge of color showed surprise, and a little displeasure, perhaps, mingled
      in her emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not the very remotest conception," said Upton, calmly. "Let us see
      what that large despatch contains; it comes from the Duke of Agecombe.
      Oh," said he, with a great effort to appear as calm and unmoved as
      possible, "I see what it is, they have given me India!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "India!" exclaimed she, in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean, my dear Princess, they have given me the Governor-Generalship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which, of course, you would not accept."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not, pray?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "India!" It is banishment, barbarism, isolation from all that really
      interests or embellishes existence,&mdash;a despotism that is wanting in
      the only element which gives a despot dignity, that he founds or
      strengthens a dynasty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, charming Princess," said he, smiling; "it is a very glorious
      sovereignty, with unlimited resources and&mdash;a very handsome stipend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which, therefore, you do not decline," said she, with a very peculiar
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With your companionship, I should call it a paradise," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And without such?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a sacrifice as one must never shrink from at the call of duty," said
      he, bowing profoundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess dined that day with the Countess of Glencore, and Sir Horace
      Upton journeyed towards England.

      CHAPTER LIV. THE END
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tears have gone over, and once more&mdash;it is for the last time&mdash;we
      come back to the old castle in the West, beside the estuary of the
      Killeries. Neglect and ruin have made heavy inroads on it. The battlements
      of the great tower have fallen. Of the windows, the stormy winds of the
      Atlantic have left only the stone mullions. The terrace is cumbered with
      loose stones and fallen masonry. Not a trace of the garden remains, save
      in the chance presence of some flowering plant or shrub, half-choked by
      weeds, and wearing out a sad existence in uncared-for solitude. The
      entrance-gate is closely barred and fastened, but a low portal, in a side
      wing, lies open, entering by which we can view the dreary desolation
      within. The apartments once inhabited by Lord Glencore are all dismantled
      and empty. The wind and the rain sweep at will along the vaulted corridors
      and through the deep-arched chambers. Of the damp, discolored walls and
      ceilings, large patches litter the floors with fragments of stucco and
      carved architraves.
    </p>
    <p>
      One small chamber, on the ground-floor, maintains a habitable aspect. Here
      a bed and a few articles of furniture, some kitchen utensils and a little
      bookshelf, all neatly and orderly arranged, show that some one calls this
      a home! Sad and lonely enough is it! Not a sound to break the weary
      stillness, save the deep roar of the heavy sea; not a living voice, save
      the wild shrill cry of the osprey, as he soars above the barren cliffs! It
      is winter, and what desolation can be deeper or gloomier! The sea-sent
      mists wrap the mountains and even the lough itself in their vapory shroud.
      The cold thin rain falls unceasingly; a cheerless, damp, and heavy
      atmosphere dwells even within doors; and the gray half light gives a
      shadowy indistinctness even to objects at hand, disposing the mind to sad
      and dreary imaginings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a deep straw chair, beside the turf fire, sits a very old man, with a
      large square volume upon his knee. Dwarfed by nature and shrunk by years,
      there is something of almost goblin semblance in the bright lustre of his
      dark eyes, and the rapid motion of his lips as he reads to himself half
      aloud. The almost wild energy of his features has survived the wear and
      tear of time, and, old as he is, there is about him a dash of vigor that
      seems to defy age. Poor Billy Traynor is now upwards of eighty; but his
      faculties are clear, his memory unclouded, and, like Moses, his eye not
      dimmed. "The Three Chronicles of Loughdooner," in which he is reading, is
      the history of the Glencores, and contains, amongst its family records,
      many curious predictions and prophecies. The heirs of that ancient house
      were, from time immemorial, the sport of fortune, enduring vicissitudes
      without end. No reverses seemed ever too heavy to rally from; no depth of
      evil fate too deep for them to extricate themselves. Involved in
      difficulties innumerable, engaged in plots, conspiracies, luckless
      undertakings, abortive enterprises, still they contrived to survive all
      around them, and come out with, indeed, ruined fortunes and beggared
      estate, but still with life, and with what is the next to life itself, an
      unconquerable energy of character.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the encouragement of these gifts that Billy now sought for what
      cheered the last declining days of his solitary life. His lord, as he ever
      called him, had been for years and years away in a distant colony, living
      under another name. Dwelling amongst the rough settlers of a wild remote
      tract, a few brief lines at long intervals were the only tidings that
      assured Billy he was yet living; yet were they enough to convince him,
      coupled with the hereditary traits of his house, that some one day or
      other he would come back again to resume his proud place and the noble
      name of his ancestors. More than once had it been the fate of the
      Glencores to see "the hearth cold, and the roof-tree blackened;" and Billy
      now muttered the lines of an old chronicle where such a destiny was
      bewailed:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Where are the voices, whispering low,
         Of lovers side by side?
     And where the haughty dames who swept
         Thy terraces in pride?
     Where is the wild and joyous mirth
         That drown'd th' Atlantic's roar,
     Making the rafters ring again
         With welcome to Glencore?
     "And where's the step of belted knight,
         That strode the massive floor?
     And where's the laugh of lady bright,
         We used to hear of yore?
     The hound that bayed, the prancing steed,
         Impatient at the door,
     May bide the time for many a year&mdash;
         They 'll never see Glencore!
</pre>
    <p>
      "And he came back, after all,&mdash;Lord Hugo,&mdash;and was taken
      prisoner at Ormond by Cromwell, and sentenced to death!" said Billy.
      "Sentenced to death!&mdash;but never shot! Nobody knew why, or ever will
      know. After years and years of exile he came back, and was at the Court of
      Charles, but never liked,&mdash;they say dangerous! That 's exactly the
      word,&mdash;dangerous!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He started up from his revery, and, taking his stick, issued from the
      room. The mist was beginning to rise, and he took his way towards the
      shore of the lough, through the wet and tangled grass. It was a long and
      toilsome walk for one so old as he was, but he went manfully onward, and
      at last reached the little jetty where the boats from the mainland were
      wont to put in. All was cheerless and leaden-hued over the wide waste of
      water; a surging swell swept heavily along, but not a sail was to be seen.
      Far across the lough he could descry the harbor of Leenane, where the
      boats were at anchor, and see the lazy smoke as it slowly rose in the
      thick atmosphere. Seated on a stone at the water's edge, Billy watched
      long and patiently, his eyes turning at times towards the bleak
      mountain-road, which for miles was visible. At last, with a weary sigh, he
      arose, and muttering, "He won't come to-day," turned back again to his
      lonely home.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this hour he lives, and waits the "coming of Glencore."
    </p>
    <p>
      THE END. <br /> <br />

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
