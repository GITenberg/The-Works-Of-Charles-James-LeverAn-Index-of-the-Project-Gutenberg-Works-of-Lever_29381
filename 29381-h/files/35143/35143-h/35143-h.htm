    <h2>
      PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1872.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I had made my arrangement with my publishers for this new story, I
      was not sorry for many reasons to place the scene of it in Ireland. One of
      my late critics, in noticing "Roland Cashel" and "The Daltons," mildly
      rebuked me for having fallen into doubtful company, and half censured&mdash;in
      Bohemian&mdash;several of the characters in these novels. I was not then,
      still less am I now, disposed to argue the point with my censor, and show
      that there is a very wide difference between the persons who move in the
      polite world, with a very questionable morality, and those patented
      adventurers whose daily existence is the product of daily address. The
      more one sees of life, the more is he struck by the fact that the mass of
      mankind is rarely very good or very bad, that the business of life is
      carried on with mixed motives; the best people being those who are least
      selfish, and the worst being little other than those who seek their own
      objects with slight regard for the consequences to others, and even less
      scruple as to the means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any uniformity in good or evil would be the deathblow to that genteel
      comedy which goes on around us, and whose highest interest very often
      centres in the surprises we give ourselves by unexpected lines of action
      and unlooked-for impulses. As this strange drama unfolded itself before
      me, it had become a passion with me to watch the actors, and speculate on
      what they might do. For this Florence offered an admirable stage. It was
      eminently cosmopolitan; and, in consequence, less under the influence of
      any distinct code of public opinion than any section of the several
      nationalities I might have found at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a universal toleration abroad; and the Spaniard conceded to the
      German, and the Russian to the Englishman, much on the score of
      nationality; and did not question too closely a morality which, after all,
      might have been little other than a conventional habit. Exactly in the
      same way, however, that one hurries away from the life of a city and its
      dissipations, to breathe the fresh air and taste the delicious quiet of
      the country, did I turn from these scenes of splendor, from the crush of
      wealth, and the conflict of emotion, to that Green Island, where so many
      of my sympathies were intertwined, and where the great problem of human
      happiness was on its trial on issues that differed wonderfully little from
      those that were being tried in gilded salons, and by people whose names
      were blazoned in history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ireland, at the time I speak of, was beginning to feel that sense of
      distrust and jealousy between the owner and the tiller of the soil which,
      later on, was to develop itself into open feud. The old ties that have
      bound the humble to the rich man, and which were hallowed by reciprocal
      acts of good-will and benevolence, were being loosened. Benefits were
      canvassed with suspicion, ungracious or unholy acts were treasured up as
      cruel wrongs. The political agitator had so far gained the ear of the
      people, that he could persuade them that there was not a hardship or a
      grievance of their lot that could not be laid at the door of the landlord.
      He was taught to regard the old relation of love and affection to the
      owner of the soil, as the remnants of a barbarism that had had its day,
      and he was led to believe that whether the tyranny that crushed him was
      the Established Church or the landlord, there was a great Liberal party
      ready to aid him in resisting either or both, when he could summon courage
      for the effort. By what promptings the poor man was brought to imagine
      that a reign of terror would suffice to establish him in an undisputed
      possession of the soil, and that the best lease was a loaded musket, it is
      not either my wish nor my duty here to narrate; I only desire to call my
      reader's attention to the time itself, as a transition period when the
      peasant had begun to resent some of the ties that had bound him to his
      landlord, and had not yet conceived the idea of that formidable conspiracy
      which issues its death-warrants and never is at a loss for the agents to
      enforce them. There were at the time some who, seeing the precarious
      condition of the period, had their grave forebodings of what was to come,
      when further estrangement between the two classes was accomplished, and
      the poor man should come to see in the rich only an oppressor and a
      tyrant. There was not at that time the armed resistance to rents, nor the
      threatening letter system to which we were afterwards to become
      accustomed, still less was there the thought that the Legislature would
      interfere to legalize the demands by which the tenant was able to coerce
      his landlord; and for a brief interval there did seem a possibility of
      reuniting once again, by the ties of benefit and gratitude, the two
      classes whose real welfare depends on concord and harmony. I have not the
      shadow of a pretext to be thought didactic, but I did believe that if I
      recalled in fiction some of the traits which once had bound up the
      relations of rich and poor, and given to our social system many of the
      characteristics of the family, I should be reviving pleasant memories if
      not doing something more.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this end I sketched the character of Mary Martin. By making the opening
      of my story date from the time of the Relief Bill, I intended to picture
      the state of the country at one of the most memorable eras in its history,
      and when an act of the Legislature assumed to redress inequalities,
      compose differences, and allay jealousies of centuries' growth, and make
      of two widely differing races one contented people.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not, I own, any implicit faith in Acts of Parliament, and I had a
      fervent belief in what kindness&mdash;when combined with knowledge of
      Ireland&mdash;could do with Irishmen. I have never heard of a people with
      whom sympathy could do so much, nor the want of it be so fatal. I have
      never heard of any other people to whom the actual amount of a benefit was
      of less moment than the mode it was bestowed. I have never read of a race
      who, in great poverty and many privations, attach a higher value to the
      consideration that is bestowed on them than to the actual material boons,
      and feel such a seemingly disproportioned gratitude for kind words and
      generous actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      What might not be anticipated from a revulsion of sentiment in a people
      like this, to what violence might not this passion for vengeance be
      carried, if the notion possessed them that they, whom she called her
      betters, only traded on the weakness of their poverty and the imbecility
      of their good faith? It was in a fruitful soil of this kind that the
      agitation now sowed the seeds of distrust and disorder; and with what
      fatal rapidity the poison reproduced itself and spread, the history of
      late years is the testimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      If such traits as I have endeavored to picture in Mary Martin were engaged
      in the work of benevolence tomorrow, they would be met on every side by
      discouragement and defeat. The priest would denounce them as a propaganda
      artfully intended to sap the ancient faith of the people; the agitators
      would denounce them as the cunning flatteries of political solicitation;
      the people themselves would distrust them as covering some secret object;
      and the National Press would be certain to utter its warnings against
      whatever promised to establish peace or contentment to the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said already, and I repeat it here, that this character of Mary
      Martin is purely fictitious; and there is the more need I should say it,
      since there was once a young lady of this very name,&mdash;many traits of
      whose affection for the people and efforts for their well being might be
      supposed to have been my original. To my great regret I never had the
      happiness to have met her; however, I have heard much of her devotion and
      her goodness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not sure that some of my subordinate characters were not drawn from
      life. Mrs. Nelligan, I remember, had her type in a little Galway town I
      once stopped at, and Dan Nelligan had much in common with one who has
      since held a distinguished place on the Bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the terrible epidemic which devastated Ireland, there was much for
      which I drew on my own experience. Of its fearful ravages in the west, in
      the wilds of Clare, and that lonely promontory that stretches at the mouth
      of the Shannon into the Atlantic, I had been the daily witness; and even
      to recall some of the incidents passingly was an effort of great pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of one feature of the people at this disastrous time, I could not say
      enough; nor could any words of mine do justice to the splendid heroism
      with which they bore up, and the noble generosity they showed each other
      in misfortune. It is but too often remarked how selfish men are made by
      misery, and how fatal is a common affliction to that charity that cares
      for others. There was none of this here; I never in any condition or class
      recognized more traits of thoughtful kindness and self-denial than I did
      amongst these poor, famished, and forgotten people. I never witnessed in
      the same perfection, how a widespread affliction could call up a humanity
      great as itself, and make very commonplace natures something actually
      heroic and glorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing short of the fatal tendency I have to digression, and the watchful
      care I am bound to bestow against this fault, prevented me from narrating
      several incidents with which my own experience had made me acquainted.
      Foreign as these were to the burden of my tale, it was only by an effort I
      overcame the temptation to recall them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a nation is to be judged by her bearing under calamity, Ireland&mdash;and
      she has had some experiences&mdash;comes well through the ordeal. That we
      may yet see how she will sustain her part in happier circumstances is my
      hope and my prayer, and that the time be not too far off.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. CRO' MARTIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am about to speak of Ireland as it was some four-and-twenty years ago,
      and feel as if I were referring to a long-past period of history, such
      have been the changes, political and social, effected in that interval!
      Tempting, as in some respects might be an investigation into the causes of
      these great changes, and even speculation as to how they might have been
      modified and whither they tend, I prefer rather to let the reader form his
      own unaided judgment on such matters, and will therefore, without more of
      preface, proceed to my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the traveller leaves the old town of Oughterard, and proceeds westward,
      he enters a wild and dreary region, with few traces of cultivation, and
      with scarcely an inhabitant. Bare, bleak mountains, fissured by many a
      torrent, bound plains of stony surface,&mdash;here and there the miserable
      hut of some "cottier," with its poor effort at tillage, in the shape of
      some roods of wet potato land, or the sorry picture of a stunted oat crop,
      green even in the late autumn. Gradually, however, the scene becomes less
      dreary. Little patches of grass land come into view, generally skirting
      some small lake; and here are to be met with droves of those wild
      Connemara ponies for which the district is so celebrated; a stunted hardy
      race, with all the endurance and courage that beseem a mountain origin.
      Further on, the grateful sight of young timber meets the eye, and large
      enclosures of larch and spruce fir are seen on every favorable spot of
      ground. And at length, on winding round the base of a steep mountain, the
      deep woods of a rich demesne appear, and soon afterwards a handsome
      entrance-gate of massive stone, with armorial bearings above it, announces
      the approach to Cro' Martin Castle, the ancient seat of the Martins.
    </p>
    <p>
      An avenue of several miles in length, winding through scenery of the most
      varied character, at one time traversing rich lawns of waving meadow, at
      another tracking its course along some rocky glen, or skirting the bank of
      a clear and rapid river, at length arrives at the castle. With few
      pretensions to architectural correctness, Cro' Martin was, indeed, an
      imposing structure. Originally the stronghold of some bold Borderer, it
      had been added to by successive proprietors, till at last it had assumed
      the proportions of a vast and spacious edifice, different eras
      contributing the different styles of building, and presenting in the mass
      traces of every architecture, from the stern old watch-tower of the
      fourteenth century to the commodious dwelling-house of our own.
    </p>
    <p>
      If correct taste might take exception to many of the external details of
      this building, the arrangements within doors, where all that elegance and
      comfort could combine were to be found, might safely challenge criticism.
      Costly furniture abounded, not for show in state apartments, shrouded in
      canvas, or screened from sunlight, but for daily use in rooms that showed
      continual habitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the apartments displayed massive specimens of that richly carved
      old oak furniture for which the châteaux of the Low Countries were famed;
      others abounded with inlaid consoles and costly tables of "marqueterie,"
      and others again exhibited that chaste white and gold which characterized
      the splendid era of the Regency in France. Great jars of Sèvres, those
      splendid mockeries of high art, stood in the windows, whose curtains were
      of the heaviest brocade. Carpets of soft Persian wool covered the floors,
      and rich tapestries were thrown over sofas and chairs with a careless
      grace, the very triumph of picturesque effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the scrupulous neatness of all these arrangements, in the orderly air,
      the demure and respectful bearing of the servants as they showed the
      castle to strangers, one might read the traces of a strict and rigid
      discipline,&mdash;features, it must be owned, that seemed little in
      accordance with the wild region that stretched on every side. The spotless
      windows of plate-glass, the polished floor that mirrored every chair that
      stood on it, the massive, and well-fitting doors, the richly gilded dogs
      that shone within the marble hearth, had little brotherhood with the
      dreary dwellings of the cottiers beyond the walls of the park; and
      certainly even Irish misery never was more conspicuous than in that lonely
      region.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was early on a calm morning of the late autumn that the silent
      courtyard of the castle resounded with the sharp quick tramp of a horse,
      suddenly followed by a loud shrill whistle, as a young girl, mounted upon
      a small but highly bred horse, galloped up to one of the back entrances.
      Let us employ the few seconds in which she thus awaited, to introduce her
      to the reader. Somewhat above the middle size, and with a figure admirably
      proportioned, her face seemed to blend the joyous character of happy
      girlhood with a temperament of resolute action. The large and liquid hazel
      eyes, with their long dark fringes, were almost at variance with the
      expression of the mouth, which, though finely and beautifully fashioned,
      conveyed the working of a spirit that usually followed its own dictates,
      and as rarely brooked much interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shaded by a broad-leaved black hat, and with a braid of her dark auburn
      hair accidentally fallen on her shoulder, Mary Martin sat patting the head
      of the wire-haired greyhound who had reared himself to her side,&mdash;a
      study for Landseer himself. Scarcely above a minute had elapsed, when
      several servants were seen running towards her, whose hurried air betrayed
      that they had only just risen from bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're all very late to-day," cried the young lady. "You should have been
      in the stables an hour ago. Where 's Brand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He 's gone into the fair, miss, with a lot of hoggets," said a little old
      fellow with a rabbit-skin cap, and a most unmistakable groom formation
      about the knees and ankles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look to the mare, Barny," said she, jumping off; "and remind me, if I
      forget it, to fine you all, for not having fed and watered before six
      o'clock. Yes, I 'll do it; I said so once before, and you 'll see I 'll
      keep my word. Is it because my uncle goes a few weeks to the seaside, that
      you are to neglect your duty? Hackett, I shall want to see the colts
      presently; go round to the straw-yard and wait till I come; and, Graft,
      let us have a look at the garden, for my aunt is quite provoked at the
      flowers you have been sending her lately."
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was said rapidly, and in a tone that evidently was not meant to
      admit of reply; and the gardener led the way, key in hand, very much with
      the air of a felon going to conviction. He was a Northern Irishman,
      however, and possessed the Scotch-like habits of prudent reserve that
      never wasted a word in a bad cause. And thus he suffered himself to be
      soundly rated upon various short-comings in his department,&mdash;celery
      that wanted landing; asparagus grown to the consistence of a walking-cane;
      branches of fruit-trees breaking under their weight of produce; and even
      weed-grown walks,&mdash;all were there, and upon all was he arraigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The old story, of course, Graft," said she, slapping her foot impatiently
      with her riding-whip,&mdash;"you have too few people in the garden; but my
      remedy will be to lessen their number. Now mark me. My uncle is coming
      home on Wednesday next,&mdash;just so&mdash;a full month earlier than you
      expected,&mdash;and if the garden be not in perfect order,&mdash;if I find
      one of these things I have complained of to-day&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my leddy, this is the season when, what wi' sellin' the fruit, and
      what wi' the new shoots&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll have it done, that 's all, Mr. Graft; and you 'll have one man less
      to do it with. I 'll go over the hothouse after breakfast," said she,
      smiling to herself at the satisfaction with which he evidently heard this
      short reprieve. Nor was he himself more anxious to escape censure than was
      she to throw off the ungracious office of inflicting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now for old Catty Broon, and a good breakfast to put me in better
      temper," said she to herself, as she entered the castle and wended her way
      to the housekeeper's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I never; but I thought it was a dream when I heard your voice
      outside," said old Catty, as she welcomed her young mistress with
      heartfelt delight; "but when I saw them runnin' here and runnin' there, I
      said, sure enough, she's come in earnest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite true, Catty," said Mary, laughing. "I surprised the garrison, and
      found them, I must say, in most sorry discipline; but never mind, they 'll
      have everything to rights by Wednesday, when we are all coming back
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was the bathing any use to my Lady, miss?" asked Catty, but in a tone
      that combined a kind of half drollery with earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's better and worse, Catty; better in health, and scarcely as
      good-humored; but, there 's a good old soul, let me have breakfast, for I
      have a great deal to do before I ride back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But sure you are not goin' to ride back to Kilkieran to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That am I, Catty, and up to Kyle's Wood and the new plantations before I
      go. Why, it's only fifteen miles, old lady!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix, you 're your father's daughter all over," said Catty, with a look
      first at <i>her</i>, and then at a water-colored sketch which occupied a
      place over the chimney, and represented a fair-haired, handsome boy of
      about ten years of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was that ever like papa?" asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis his born image, it is," said Catty; and her eyes swam with tears as
      she turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, to <i>my</i> thinking he is far better-looking in that picture!"
      said Mary, pointing with her whip to a colored drawing of a showily
      dressed dragoon officer, reining in his charger, and seeming to eye with
      considerable disdain the open mouth of a cannon in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, then, the other was more himself!" sighed Catty; "and more nat'ral
      too, with the long hair on his neck and that roguish laugh in his eye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And neither are very like that!" said Mary, pointing to a third portrait,
      which represented a swarthy horseman with a wide sombrero and a jacket all
      braided and buttoned in Mexican fashion, a rifle at his back, and a long
      lance in his hand, with the heavy coil of a lasso at his saddle-peak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arrah, that ain't a bit like him," said the old woman, querulously, "for
      all that he said that it was."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary arose at the words, and perused aloud some lines which were written
      at the foot of the picture, and which many and many a time before she had
      conned over and repeated. They ran thus: "Aye, Catty, though you won't
      believe it, that rough-looking old rider, all bearded and sunburned, is
      your own wild Barry of former days; and for all that the world has done,
      wonderfully little altered in the core, though the crust is not very like
      that cherry-cheeked boy that used to, and mayhap still may, hang over your
      fireplace.&mdash;Guastalla, May, 1808."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And has he not written since that?" sighed the girl, over whom the dark
      shadow of orphanhood passed as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twice only: the first of the two spoke of his coming home again; but
      somehow he seemed to be put off it, and the next letter was all about you,
      as if he did n't mean to come back! My Lady and Master Barry never was
      fond of each other," muttered the old woman, after a pause, and as though
      giving an explanation to some problem that she was working within her own
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But my uncle loved him," broke in Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why wouldn't he? War n't they twins? There was only a few minutes
      between them,&mdash;long enough to make one a rich man, and leave the
      other only his own wits and the wide world for a fortune! Ayeh, ayeh!"
      grumbled out the old crone, "if they were both born poor, they 'd be
      livin' together like brothers now, under the one roof,&mdash;happy and
      comfortable; and you and your cousin, Master Dick, would be playfellows
      and companions, instead of his being away in Ingia, or America, or
      wherever it is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl leaned her head on her hand, and appeared to have fallen
      into a deep train of thought; for she never noticed old Catty's remarks,
      nor, indeed, seemed conscious of her presence for some time. "Catty," said
      she, at length, and in a voice of unusually calm earnestness, "never talk
      to me of these things; they only fret me; they set me a thinking of Heaven
      knows what longings,&mdash;for a home that should be more like a real home
      than this, though God knows my uncle is all that I could wish in kindness
      and affection; but&mdash;but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, and her lip quivered, and her eyes grew heavy-looking; and
      then, with a kind of struggle against her emotions, she added gayly, "Come
      and show me the dairy, Catty. I want to see all those fine things in
      Wedgewood-ware that you got while we were away, and then we 'll have a
      peep at the calves, and by that time it will be the hour for my levee."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix, miss," said the old woman, "they 're all here already. The news
      soon spread that you came over this morning, and you 'll have a great
      assembly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll not keep them waiting, then," said Mary; and, so saying, she left
      the room, and proceeding by many passages and corridors, at length reached
      a remote part of the building which once had formed part of the ancient
      edifice. A suite of low-ceiled rooms here opened upon a small grassy
      enclosure, all of which had been appropriated by Mary to her own use. One
      was a little library or study, neatly but very modestly furnished;
      adjoining it was her office, where she transacted all business matters;
      and beyond that again was a large chamber, whose sole furniture consisted
      in a row of deal presses against the walls, and a long table or counter
      which occupied the middle of the room. Two large windows opening to the
      floor lighted the apartment; and no sooner had Mary thrown these wide,
      than a burst of salutations and greetings arose from a dense and motley
      crowd assembled on the grass outside, and who stood, sat, or lay in every
      possible attitude and grouping, their faces all turned towards the window
      where she was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      With true native volubility they poured out not only their welcomings, but
      a number of interjectional flatteries, supposed not to be audible by her
      on whom they commented; and thus her hair, her eyes, her teeth, her
      complexion, even her foot, were praised with an enthusiasm of admiration
      that might have shamed more polished worshippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      These muttered eulogies continued as the young girl was occupied unlocking
      drawers and presses, and placing upon the table several books and papers,
      as well as a small scale and weights,&mdash;preparations all equally the
      source of fruitful observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company was entirely of the softer sex,&mdash;an epithet not perhaps
      in the strictest accordance with an array of faces that really might have
      shamed witchcraft. Bronzed, blear-eyed, and weather-beaten, seamed with
      age and scarred with sickness, shrewd-looking, suspicious, and crafty in
      every lineament, there was yet one characteristic predominant over all,&mdash;an
      intense and abject submission, an almost slavish deference to every
      observation addressed to them. Their dress bespoke the very greatest
      poverty; not only were they clothed in rags of every hue and shape, but
      all were barefooted, and some of the very oldest wore no other covering to
      their heads than their own blanched and grizzled locks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor would a follower of Lavater have argued too favorably of the
      prosperity of Irish regeneration, in beholding that array of faces,&mdash;low-browed,
      treacherous-looking, and almost savagely cruel, as many of them were in
      expression. There was not, indeed, as often is to be remarked amongst the
      peasant class of many countries, a look of stupid, stolid indifference; on
      the contrary, their faces were intensely, powerfully significant, and
      there was stamped upon them that strange mixture of malignant drollery and
      sycophancy that no amount of either good or adverse fortune ever entirely
      subdues in their complex natures.

    <p>
      The expediency of misery had begotten the expediency of morals, and in all
      the turnings and windings of their shifty natures you could see the
      suggestions of that abject destitution which had eaten into their very
      hearts. It would have puzzled a moralist to analyze these "gnarled
      natures," wherein some of the best and some of the worst features of
      humanity warred and struggled together. Who could dare to call them
      kind-hearted or malevolent, grateful or ungrateful, free-giving or
      covetous, faithful or capricious, as a people? Why, they were all these,
      and fifty other things just as opposite besides, every twenty-four hours
      of their lives! Their moods of mind ranged from one extreme to the other;
      nothing had any permanency amongst them but their wretchedness. Of all
      their qualities, however, that which most obstructed their improvement,
      ate deepest into their natures, and suggested the worst fears for the
      future, was suspicion. They trusted nothing,&mdash;none,&mdash;so that
      every benefit bestowed on them came alloyed with its own share of doubt;
      and all the ingenuity of their crafty minds found congenial occupation in
      ascribing this or that motive to every attempt to better their condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Martin knew them&mdash;understood them&mdash;as well as most people;
      few, indeed, out of their own actual station of life had seen so much of
      their domesticity. From her very childhood she had been conversant with
      their habits and their ways. She had seen them patient under the most
      trying afflictions, manfully braving every ill of life, and submitting
      with a noble self-devotion to inevitable calamity; and she had also beheld
      them, with ignorant impatience, resenting the slightest interference when
      they deemed it uncalled for, and rejecting kindness when it came coupled
      with the suggestion of a duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      By considerable skill, and no little patience, she had insinuated a
      certain small amount of discipline into this disorderly mass. She could
      not succeed in persuading them to approach her one by one, or wait with
      any semblance of order while she was yet occupied; but she enforced
      conformity with at least one rule, which was, that none should speak save
      in answer to some question put by herself. This may seem a very small
      matter, and yet to any one who knows the Irish peasant it will appear
      little short of miraculous. The passion for discursiveness, the tendency
      to make an effective theme of their misery, whatever particular shape it
      may assume, is essentially national; and to curb this vent to native
      eloquence was to oppose at once the strongest impulse of their natures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing short of actual, tangible benefits could compensate them for what
      they scrupled not to think was downright cruelty; nor was it till after
      months of steady perseverance on her part that her system could be said to
      have attained any success. Many of the most wretched declined to seek
      relief on the conditions thus imposed. Some went as actual rebels, to show
      their friends and neighbors how they would resist such intolerance;
      others, again, professed that they only went out of curiosity. Strange and
      incomprehensible people, who can brave every ill of poverty, endure famine
      and fever and want, and yet will not bow the head to a mere matter of
      form, nor subject themselves to the very least restriction when a passion
      or a caprice stands opposed to it! After about eighteen months of hard
      persistence the system began at length to work; the refractory spirits had
      either refrained from coming or had abandoned the opposition; and now a
      semblance of order pervaded the motley assemblage. Whenever the slightest
      deviation from the ritual occurred, a smart tap of a small ivory ruler on
      the table imposed silence; and they who disregarded the warning were
      ordered to move by, unattended to. Had a stranger been permitted,
      therefore, to take a peep at these proceedings, he would have been
      astonished at the rapidity with which complaints were heard, and wants
      redressed; for, with an instinct thoroughly native, Mary Martin
      appreciated the cases which came before her, and rarely or never
      confounded the appeal of real suffering with the demands of fictitious
      sorrow. Most of those who came were desirous of tickets for Dispensary
      aid; for sickness has its permanent home in the Irish cabin, and fever
      lurks amidst the damp straw and the smoky atmosphere of the poor peasant's
      home. Some, however, came for articles of clothing, or for aid to make and
      repair them; others for some little assistance in diet, barley for a sick
      man's drink, a lemon or an orange to moisten the parched lips of fever;
      others, again, wanted leave to send a grandchild or a niece to the school;
      and, lastly, a few privileged individuals appeared to claim their weekly
      rations of snuff or tobacco,&mdash;little luxuries accorded to old age,&mdash;comforts
      that solaced many a dreary hour of a joyless existence. Amongst all the
      crowded mass there was not one whom Mary had not known and visited in
      their humble homes. Thoroughly conversant with their condition and their
      necessities, she knew well their real wants; and if one less hopeful than
      herself might have despaired to render any actual relief to such
      widespread misery, she was sanguine enough to be encouraged by the results
      before her, small and few as they were, to think that possibly the good
      time was yet to come when such efforts would be unneeded, and when
      Ireland's industry, employed and rewarded, would more than suffice for all
      the requirements of her humble poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane Maloney," said Mary, placing a small packet on the table, "give this
      to Sally Kieran as you pass her door; and here 's the order for your own
      cloak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May the heavens be your bed. May the holy&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Catty Honan," cried Mary, with a gesture to enforce silence. "Catty, your
      granddaughter never comes to the school now that she has got leave. What's
      the reason of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix, your reverance, miss, 'tis ashamed she is by ray-son of her
      clothes. She says Luke Cassidy's daughters have check aprons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more of this, Catty. Tell Eliza to come on Monday, and if I 'm
      satisfied with her she shall have one too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two ounces of tea for the Widow Jones."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ayeh," muttered an old hag. "But it's weak it makes it without a little
      green in it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are the pains, Sarah?" asked Mary, turning to a very feeble-looking
      old creature with crutches.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Worse and worse, my Lady. With every change of the weather they come on
      afresh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The doctor will attend you, Sally, and if he thinks wine good for you,
      you shall have it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'T is that same would be the savin' of me, Miss Mary," said a
      cunning-eyed little woman, with a tattered straw bonnet on her head, and a
      ragged shawl over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think so, Nancy. Come up to the house on Monday morning and help
      Mrs. Taafe with the bleaching."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So this is the duplicate, Polly?" said she, taking a scrap of paper from
      an old woman whose countenance indicated a blending of dissipation with
      actual want.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One-and-fourpence was all I got on it, and trouble enough it gave me."
      These words she uttered with a heavy sigh, and in a tone at once resentful
      and complaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were my uncle to know that you had pawned your cloak, Polly, he 'd never
      permit you to cross his threshold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ayeh, it's a great sin, to be sure," whined out the hag, half insolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A great shame and a great disgrace it certainly is; and I shall stop all
      relief to you till the money be paid back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why not!" "To be sure!" "Miss Mary is right!" "What else could she
      do?" broke in full twenty sycophant voices, who hoped to prefer their own
      claims by the cheap expedient of condemning another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Widow Hannigan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, miss," simpered out a smiling little old creature, with a courtesy,
      as she held up a scroll of paper in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What 's this, Widow Hannigan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'T is a picture Mickey made of you, miss, when you was out riding that
      day with the hounds; he saw you jumping a stone wall."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary smiled at the performance, which certainly did not promise future
      excellence, and went on,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell Mickey to mend his writing; his was the worst copy in the class; and
      here's a card for your daughter's admission into the Infirmary. By the
      way, widow, which of the boys was it I saw dragging the river on
      Wednesday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix, miss, I don't know. Sure it was none of ours would dare to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, they would, any one of them; but I 'll not permit it; and what's
      more, widow, if it occur again, I 'll withdraw the leave I gave to fish
      with a rod.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Teresa Johnson, your niece is a very good child, and promises to be very
      handy with her needle. Let her hem these handkerchiefs, and there's a
      frock for herself. My uncle says Tom shall have half his wages paid him
      till he's able to come to work again."
    </p>
    <p>
      But why attempt to follow out what would be but the long, unending
      catalogue of native misery,&mdash;that dreary series of wants and
      privations to which extreme destitution subjects a long-neglected and
      helpless people? There was nothing from the cradle to the coffin, from the
      first wailing wants of infancy to the last requirement of doting old age,
      that they did not stand in need of.
    </p>
    <p>
      A melancholy spectacle, indeed, was it to behold an entire population so
      steeped in misery, so utterly inured to wretchedness, that they felt no
      shame at its exposure, but rather a sort of self-exultation at any
      opportunity of displaying a more than ordinary amount of human suffering
      and sorrow;&mdash;to hear them how they caressed their afflictions, how
      they seemed to fondle their misfortunes, vying with each other in
      calamity, and bidding higher and higher for a little human sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Martin set herself stoutly to combat this practice, including, as it
      does, one of the most hopeless features of the national character. To
      inculcate habits of self-reliance she was often driven, in violation of
      her own feelings, to favor those who least needed assistance, but whose
      efforts to improve their condition might serve as an example. With a
      people who are such consummate actors she was driven into simulation
      herself, and paraded sentiments of displeasure and condemnation when her
      very heart was bursting with pity and compassion. No wonder was it, then,
      that she rejoiced when this painful task was completed, and she found
      herself in the more congenial duty of looking over the "young stock," and
      listening to old Barny's predictions about yearlings and two-year-olds.
    </p>
    <p>
      This young girl, taught to read by a lady's maid, and to sew by a
      housekeeper, possessed scarcely any of the resources so usual to those in
      her own condition, and was of sheer necessity thrown upon herself for
      occupation and employment. Her intense sympathy with the people, her
      fondness for them even in their prejudices, had suggested the whole story
      of her life. Her uncle took little or no interest in the details of his
      property. The indolence in which he first indulged from liking, became at
      last a part of his very nature, and he was only too well pleased to see
      the duty undertaken by another which had no attraction for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Mary will look to it"&mdash;"Tell my niece of it"&mdash;"Miss Martin
      will give her orders," were the invariable replies by which he escaped all
      trouble, and suffered the whole weight of labor and responsibility to
      devolve upon a young girl scarcely out of her teens, until gradually, from
      the casual care of a flower-garden, or a childish pleasure in giving
      directions, she had succeeded to the almost unlimited rule of her uncle's
      house and his great estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Martin was often alarmed at some of his niece's measures of reform.
      The large sums drawn out of bank, the great expenses incurred in weekly
      wages, the vast plans of building, draining, road-making, and even
      bridging, terrified him; while the steward, Mr. Henderson, slyly
      insinuated, that though Miss Mary was a wonderful manager, and the "best
      head he ever knew, except my Lady's," she was dreadfully imposed on by the
      people&mdash;but, to be sure, "how could a young lady be up to them?" But
      she was up to them, aye, and more still, she was up to Mr. Henderson
      himself, notwithstanding his mild, douce manner, his cautious reserve, and
      his unbroken self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very far from my intention to say that Mary Martin was not over and
      over again the dupe of some artifice or other of the crafty and subtle
      natures that surrounded her. Mock misery, mock industry, mock
      enlightenment, mock conviction, even mock submission and resignation, had
      all their partial successes; and she was entrapped by many a pretence that
      would have had no chance of imposing on Mr. Henderson. Still there was a
      credit side to this account, wherein his name would not have figured.
      There were traits of the people, which he neither could have understood or
      valued. There were instincts&mdash;hard struggling efforts, fighting their
      way through all the adverse circumstances of their poverty&mdash;that he
      never could have estimated, much less could he have speculated on the
      future to which they might one day attain.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mary was heart and soul devoted to her object,&mdash;if she thought of
      nothing else,&mdash;if all her dreams by night and all her daily efforts
      were in the cause, she was by no means insensible to the flattery which
      constantly beset her. She accepted it readily and freely, laughing at what
      she persuaded herself to believe was the mere exuberance of that national
      taste for praise. Like most warm and impulsive natures, she was greedy of
      approbation; even failure itself was consoled by a word of encomium on the
      effort. She liked to be thought active, clever, and energetic. She loved
      to hear the muttered voices which at any moment of difficulty said, "Faix,
      Miss Mary will find the way to it;" or, "Sure it won't baffle <i>her</i>,
      anyhow." This confidence in her powers stimulated and encouraged her,
      often engendering the very resources it imputed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She might have made many a mistake in the characters of those for whom she
      was interested,&mdash;conceived many a false hope,&mdash;nurtured many a
      delusive expectation; but in the scheme of life she had planned out for
      herself, the exalting sense of a duty more than recompensed her for every
      failure: and if any existence could be called happy, it was hers,&mdash;the
      glorious excitement of an open-air life, with all its movements and
      animation. There was that amount of adventure and enterprise which gave a
      character of romantic interest to her undertakings, and thus elevated her
      to a degree of heroism to herself, and then, knowing no fatigue, she was
      again in the saddle, and, straight as the crow flies, over the county to
      Kyle's Wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      A solitary cabin or two stood in the midst of the wild, bleak plain, and
      by these she paused for a few minutes. The watchful eyes that followed her
      as she went, and the muttered blessings that were wafted after her,
      proclaimed what her mission had been, and showed how she had for a brief
      space thrown a gleam of sunshine over the darksome gloom of some sad
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless her! she's always cheerful and light-hearted," said the poor
      peasant, as he leaned on his spade to look after her; "and one feels
      better the whole day after the sight of her!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. KILKIERAN BAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      In one of the many indentures of Kilkieran Bay,&mdash;favored by a
      southerly aspect and a fine sandy beach, sheltered by two projecting
      headlands,&mdash;stood a little row of cabins, originally the dwellings of
      poor fishermen, but now, in summer-time, the resort of the neighboring
      gentry, who frequented the coast for sea-bathing. There was little attempt
      made by the humble owners to accommodate the habits of the wealthy
      visitors. Some slight effort at neatness, or some modest endeavor at
      internal decoration, by a little window-curtain or a rickety chest of
      drawers, were the very extent of these pretensions. Year by year the
      progress of civilization went thus lazily forward; and, far from finding
      fault with this backwardness, it was said that the visitors were just as
      well satisfied. Many hoped to see the place as they remembered it in their
      own childhood, many were not sorry to avail themselves of its inexpensive
      life and simple habits, and some were more pleased that its humble
      attractions could draw no strangers to sojourn there to mock by their more
      costly requirements the quiet ways of the old residents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the shelter of a massive rock, which formed the northern boundary of
      the little bay, stood one building of more pretension. It was a handsome
      bathing-lodge, with a long veranda towards the sea, and an effort, not
      very successful, however, at a little flower-garden in front. The spacious
      bay-windows, which opened in French fashion, were of plate-glass; the deep
      projecting eave was ornamented with a handsome cornice; and the entire
      front had been richly decorated by entablatures in stucco and common
      cement. Still, somehow, there seemed to be a spiteful resistance in the
      climate to such efforts at embellishment. The wild hurricanes that swept
      over the broad Atlantic were not to be withstood by the frail timbers of
      the Gothic veranda. The sweeping gusts that sent foaming spray high over
      the rocky cliffs shattered the costly panes, and smashed even the mullions
      that held them; while fragments of carving, or pieces of stuccoed tracery,
      together with broken vases and uprooted shrubs, littered the garden and
      the terrace. The house was but a few years built, and yet was already
      dilapidated and ruinous-looking. A stout stone wall had replaced the
      trellised woodwork of one side of the porch; some of the windows were
      firmly barricaded with boards on the outside; and iron cramps and other
      appliances equally unsightly on the roof, showed by what means the slates
      were enabled to resist the storms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aspect of consistent poverty never inspires ridicule. It is shabby
      gentility alone that provokes the smile of sarcastic meaning; and thus the
      simple dwellings of the fishermen, in all their humility, offered nothing
      to the eye of critical remark. There seemed abundant absurdity in this
      attempt to defy climate and aspect, place and circumstance; and every
      effort to repair an accident but brought out the pretension into more
      glaring contrast. The "Osprey's Nest," as Lady Dorothea Martin had styled
      her bathing-lodge, bore, indeed, but a sorry resemblance to its
      water-colored emblem in the plan of the architect; for Mr. Kirk had not
      only improvised a beautiful villa, with fuchsias and clematis and
      moss-roses clustering on it, but he had invented an Italian sky, and given
      a Lago Maggiore tint to the very Atlantic. Your fashionable architect is
      indeed a finished romancer, and revels in the license of his art with a
      most voluptuous abandonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now, however, late in the autumn; some warnings of the approaching
      equinox had already been felt, and the leaden sky above, and the
      dark-green, sullen sea beneath, above which a cold northwester swept
      gustily, recalled but little of the artistic resemblance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The short September day was drawing to a close, and it was just that
      dreary interval between day and dusk, so glorious in fine weather, but so
      terribly depressing in the cold ungenial season, as all the frequenters of
      the little bay were hastening homeward for the night. Already a twinkling
      candle or two showed that some had retired to their humble shealings to
      grumble over the discomforts about them, and speculate on a speedy
      departure. They who visited Kilkieran during the "season" were usually the
      gentry families of the neighborhood; but as the summer wore over, their
      places were occupied by a kind of "half-price company,"&mdash;shopkeepers
      and smart residents of Oughterard, who waited for their pleasure till it
      could be obtained economically. Of this class were now those on the
      evening I have mentioned, and to a small select party of whom I now desire
      to introduce my reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was "Mrs. Cronan's Evening"&mdash;for the duty of host was taken in
      rotation&mdash;and Mrs. Cronan was one of the leaders of fashion in
      Oughterard, for she lived on her own private means, at the top of Carraway
      Street, entertained Father Maher every Sunday at dinner, and took in the
      "Galway Intelligence," which, it is but fair to say, was, from inverted
      letters and press blunders, about as difficult reading as any elderly lady
      ever confronted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cronan was eminently genteel,&mdash;that is to say, she spent her
      life in unceasing lamentations over the absence of certain comforts "she
      was always used to," and passed her days in continual reference to some
      former state of existence, which, to hear her, seemed almost borrowed
      bodily out of the "Arabian Nights." Then there was Captain Bodkin, of the
      Galway Fencibles,&mdash;a very fat, asthmatic old gentleman, who came down
      to the "salt water" every summer for thirty years, fully determined to
      bathe, but never able to summon courage to go in. He was a kind-hearted,
      jolly old fellow, who loved strong punch and long whist, and cared very
      little how the world went on, if these enjoyments were available.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was Miss Busk, a very tall, thin, ghostly personage, with a
      pinkish nose and a pinched lip, but whose manners were deemed the very
      type of high breeding, for she courtesied or bowed at almost minute
      intervals during an "Evening," and had a variety of personal reminiscences
      of the Peerage. She was of "an excellent family," Mrs. Cronan always said;
      and though reduced by circumstances, she was the Swan and Edgar of
      Oughterard,&mdash;"was company for the Queen herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth hand in the whist-table was usually taken by Mrs. Nelligan,
      wife of "Pat Nelligan," the great shopkeeper of Oughterard, and who,
      though by no means entitled on heraldic grounds to take her place in any
      such exalted company, was, by the happy accident of fortune, elevated to
      this proud position. Mrs. Nelligan being unwell, her place was, on the
      present occasion, supplied by her son; and of him I would fain say a few
      words, since the reader is destined to bear company with him when the
      other personages here referred to have been long forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph Nelligan was a tall, pale young fellow who, though only just passed
      twenty-two, looked several years older; the serious, thoughtful expression
      of his face giving the semblance of age. His head was large and massively
      shaped, and the temples were strong and square, deeply indented at the
      sides, and throwing the broad, high forehead into greater prominence; dark
      eyes, shaded by heavy, black eyebrows, lent an almost scowling character
      to a face which, regular in feature, was singularly calm and
      impassive-looking. His voice was deep, low, and sonorous, and though
      strongly impressed with the intonation of his native province, was
      peculiarly soft, and, to Irish ears, even musical. He was, however,
      remarkably silent; rarely or never conversed, as his acquaintances
      understood conversation, and only when roused by some theme that he cared
      for, or stimulated by some assertion that he dissented from, was he heard
      to burst forth into a rapid flow of words, uttered as though under the
      impulse of passion, and of which, when ended, he seemed actually to feel
      ashamed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was no favorite with the society of Kilkieran; some thought him
      downright stupid; others regarded him as a kind of spy upon his neighbors,&mdash;an
      imputation most lavishly thrown out in every circle where there is nothing
      to detect, and where all the absurdity lies palpable on the surface; and
      many were heard to remark that he seemed to forget who he was, and that
      "though he was a college student, he ought to remember he was only Pat
      Nelligan's son."
    </p>
    <p>
      If he never courted their companionship, he as little resented their
      estrangement from him. He spent his days and no small share of his nights
      in study; books supplied to him the place of men, and in their converse he
      forgot the world. His father's vanity had entered him as a Fellow-Commoner
      in the University, and even this served to widen the interval between him
      and those of his own age; his class-fellows regarded his presence amongst
      them as an intolerable piece of low-bred presumption. Nor was this
      unkindly feeling diminished when they saw him, term after term, carry away
      the prizes of each examination; for equally in science as in classics was
      he distinguished, till at length it became a current excuse for failure
      when a man said, "I was in Nelligan's division."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not impossible that his social isolation contributed much to his
      success. For him there were none of the amusements which occupy those of
      his own age. The very fact of his fellow-commoner's gown separated him as
      widely from one set of his fellow-students as from the other, and thus was
      he left alone with his ambition. As time wore on, and his successes
      obtained wider notoriety, some of those in authority in the University
      appeared to be disposed to make advances to him; but he retreated modestly
      from these marks of notice, shrouding himself in his obscurity, and
      pleading the necessity for study. At length came the crowning act of his
      college career, in the examination for the gold medal; and although no
      competitor was bold enough to dispute the prize with him, he was obliged
      to submit to the ordeal. It is rarely that the public vouchsafes any
      interest in the details of University honors; but this case proved an
      exception, and almost every journal of the capital alluded in terms of
      high paneygric to the splendid display he made on that occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the very midst of these triumphs, young Nelligan arrived at his
      father's house in Oughterard, to enjoy the gratification his success had
      diffused at home, and rest himself after his severe labors. Little as old
      Pat Nelligan of his neighbors knew of University honors, or the toil which
      won them, there was enough in the very publicity of his son's career to
      make him a proud man. He at least knew that Joe had beaten them all; that
      none could hold a candle to him; "that for nigh a century such answering
      had not been heard on the bench." This was the expression of a Dublin
      journal, coupled with the partisan regret that, by the bigoted statutes of
      the college, genius of such order should be denied the privilege of
      obtaining a fellowship.
    </p>
    <p>
      If young Nelligan retired, half in pride, half in bashful-ness, from the
      notice of society in Dublin, he was assuredly little disposed to enter
      into the gayeties and dissipations of a small country-town existence. The
      fulsome adulation of some, the stupid astonishment of others, but, worse
      than either, the vulgar assumption that his success was a kind of party
      triumph,&mdash;a blow dealt by the plebeian against the patrician, the
      Papist against the Protestant,&mdash;shocked and disgusted him, and he was
      glad to leave Oughterard and accompany his mother to the seaside. She was
      an invalid of some years' standing,&mdash;a poor, frail, simple-hearted
      creature, who, after a long, struggling life of hardship and toil, saw
      herself in affluence and comfort, and yet could not bring her mind to
      believe it true. As little could she comprehend the strange fact of Joe's
      celebrity; of his name figuring in newspapers, and his health being drunk
      at a public dinner in his native town. To her he was invaluable; the very
      tenderest of nurses, and the best of all companions. She did n't care for
      books, even those of the most amusing kind; but she loved to hear the
      little gossip of the place where the neighbors passed the evening; what
      topics they discussed; who had left and who had arrived, and every other
      little incident of their uneventful lives. Simple and easy of execution as
      such an office might have been to a kindred spirit, to Joseph Nelligan it
      proved no common labor. And certain it is that the mistakes he committed
      in names, and the blunders he fell into as regarded events, rather
      astonished his mother, and led that good lady to believe that Trinity
      College must not have been fertile in genius when poor Joe was regarded as
      one of the great luminaries of his time. "Ah," would she say, "if he had
      his father's head it would be telling him! but, poor boy, he remembers
      nothing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This digression&mdash;far longer than I cared to make it, but which has
      grown to its present extent under my hands&mdash;will explain young
      Nelligan's presence at Mrs. Cronan's "Tea," where already a number of
      other notables had now assembled, and were gracefully dispersed through
      the small rooms which formed her apartment. Play of various kinds formed
      the chief amusement of the company; and while the whist-table, in decorous
      gravity, held the chief place in the sitting-room, a laughing round game
      occupied the kitchen, and a hardly contested "hit" of backgammon was being
      fought out on the bed, where, for lack of furniture, the combatants had
      established themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The success of an evening party is not always proportionate to the means
      employed to secure it. Very splendid <i>salons</i>, costly furniture, and
      what newspapers call "all the delicacies of the season," are occasionally
      to be found in conjunction with very dull company; while a great deal of
      enjoyment and much social pleasure are often to be met with where the
      material resources have been of the fewest and most simple kind. On the
      present occasion there was a great deal of laughing, and a fair share of
      love-making; some scolding at whist, and an abundance of scandal, at least
      of that cut-and-thrust-at character which amuses the speakers themselves,
      and is never supposed to damage those who are the object of it. All the
      company who had frequented the port&mdash;as Kilkieran was called&mdash;during
      the season were passed in review, and a number of racy anecdotes
      interchanged about their rank, morals, fortune, and pretensions. A very
      general impression seemed to prevail that in the several points of
      climate, scenery, social advantages, and amusements, Kilkieran might stand
      a favorable comparison with the first watering-places, not alone of
      England, but the Continent; and after various discursive reasons why its
      fame had not equalled its deserts, there was an almost unanimous
      declaration of opinion that the whole fault lay with the Martins; not,
      indeed, that the speakers were very logical in their arguments, since some
      were heard to deplore the change from the good old times, when everybody
      was satisfied to live anywhere and anyhow, when there was no road to the
      place but a bridle-path, not a loaf of bread to be had within twelve
      miles, no post-office; while others eloquently expatiated on all that
      might have been, and yet was not done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We tried to get up a little news-room," said Captain Bodkin, "and I went
      to Martin myself about it, but he hum'd and ha'd, and said, until people
      subscribed for the Dispensary he thought they needn't mind newspapers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just like him," said Mrs. Cronan; "but, indeed, I think it's my Lady does
      it all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I differ from you, ma'am," said Miss Busk, with a bland smile; "I
      attribute the inauspicious influence to another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean Miss Martin?" said Mrs. Cronan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so, ma'am; indeed, I have reason to know I am correct. This time two
      years it was I went over to Cro' Martin House to propose opening 'my
      Emporium' for the season at the port. I thought it was due to the owners
      of the estate, and due to myself also," added Miss Busk, majestically, "to
      state my views about a measure so intimately associated with the&mdash;the&mdash;in
      fact, what I may call the interests of civilization. I had just received
      my plates of the last fashions from Dublin,&mdash;you may remember them,
      ma'am; I showed them to you at Mrs. Cullenane's&mdash;well, when I was in
      the very middle of my explanation, who should come into the room but Miss
      Martin&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dressed in the old brown riding-habit?" interposed a fat old lady with
      one eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mrs. Few, in the old brown riding-habit. She came up to the table,
      with a saucy laugh in her face, and said, 'Why, uncle, are you going to
      give a fancy ball?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It is the last arrival from Paris, miss,' said I; 'the Orleans mantle,
      which, though not a "costume de Chasse," is accounted very becoming.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ah, you 're laughing at my old habit, Miss Busk,' said she, seeing how I
      eyed her; 'and it really is very shabby, but I intend to give Dan Leary a
      commission to replace it one of these days.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dan Leary, of the Cross-roads!" exclaimed Captain Bodkin, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pledge you my word of honor, sir, she said it. 'And as to all this
      finery, Miss Busk,' said she, turning over the plates with her whip, 'it
      would be quite unsuitable to our country, our climate, and our habits; not
      to say, that the Orleans mantle would be worn with an ill grace when our
      people are going half naked!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Positively indecent! downright indelicate!" shuddered Mrs. Cronan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And did Martin agree with her?" asked the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to know when he dared to do otherwise. Why, between my lady
      and the niece he can scarcely call his life his own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They say he has a cruel time of it," sighed Mr. Clinch, the
      revenue-officer, who had some personal experience of domestic slavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tush,&mdash;nonsense!" broke in his wife. "I never knew one of those
      hen-pecked creatures that was n't a tyrant in his family. I 'll engage, if
      the truth were known, Lady Dorothy has the worst of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, and he's much altered from what he was when a boy, if any one
      rules him," said the captain. "I was at school with him and his
      twin-brother Barry. I remember the time when one of them had to wear a bit
      of red ribbon in his button-hole to distinguish him from the other. They
      were the born images of each other,&mdash;that is, in looks; for in real
      character they were n't a bit like. Godfrey was a cautious, quiet, careful
      chap that looked after his pocket-money, and never got into scrapes; and
      Barry was a wasteful devil that made the coin fly, and could be led by any
      one. I think he 'd have given his life for his brother any day. I remember
      once when Godfrey would n't fight a boy,&mdash;I forget what it was about;
      Barry stole the bit of ribbon out of his coat, and went up and fought in
      his place; and a mighty good thrashing he got, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have heard my father speak of that," said a thin, pale, careworn little
      man in green spectacles; "for the two boys were taken away at once, and it
      was the ruin of the school."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it was, doctor; you're right there," broke in the Captain; "and they
      say that Martin bears a grudge against you to this day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would be hard," sighed the meek doctor; "for I had nothing to do
      with it, or my father, either. But it cost him dearly!" added he,
      mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know best, doctor, whether it is true or not; but he certainly was
      n't your friend when you tried for the Fever Hospital."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was because Pat Nelligan was on my committee," said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And was that sufficient to lose you Mr. Martin's support, sir?" asked
      young Nelligan, with a degree of astonishment in his face, that, joined to
      the innocence of the question, caused a general burst of hearty laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The young gentleman knows more about <i>cubic</i> sections, it appears,
      than of what goes on in his own town," said the Captain. "Why, sir, your
      father is the most independent man in all Oughterard; and if I know
      Godfrey Martin, he 'd give a thousand guineas this night to have him out
      of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      A somewhat animated "rally" followed this speech, in which different
      speakers gave their various reasons why Martin ought or ought not to make
      any sacrifice to put down the spirit of which Pat Nelligan was the chief
      champion. These arguments were neither cogent nor lucid enough to require
      repeating; nor did they convey to Joseph himself, with all his anxiety for
      information, the slightest knowledge on the subject discussed. Attention
      was, however, drawn off the theme by the clattering sound of a horse
      passing along the shingly shore at a smart gallop; and with eager
      curiosity two or three rushed to the door to see what it meant. A swooping
      gust of wind and rain, overturning chairs and extinguishing candles, drove
      them suddenly back again; and, half laughing at the confusion, half
      cursing the weather, the party barricaded the door, and returned to their
      places.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course it was Miss Martin; who else would be out at this time of the
      night?" said Mrs. Clinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And without a servant!" exclaimed Miss Busk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, you may well make the remark, ma'am," said Mrs. Cronan. "The
      young lady was brought up in a fashion that was n't practised in my time!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where could she have been down that end of the port, I wonder?" said Mrs.
      Clinch. "She came up from Garra Cliff."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe she came round by the strand," said the doctor; "if she did, I
      don't think there 's one here would like to have followed her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would n't be her horse!" said one; "nor her groom!" muttered another;
      and thus, gradually lashing themselves into a wild indignation, they
      opened, at last, a steady fire upon the young lady,&mdash;her habits, her
      manners, and her appearance all coming in for a share of criticism; and
      although a few modest amendments were put in favor of her horsemanship and
      her good looks, the motion was carried that no young lady ever took such
      liberties before, and that the meeting desired to record their strongest
      censure on the example thus extended to their own young people.
    </p>
    <p>
      If young Nelligan ventured upon a timid question of what it was she had
      done, he was met by an eloquent chorus of half a dozen voices, recounting
      mountain excursions which no young lady had ever made before; distant
      spots visited, dangers incurred, storms encountered, perils braved,
      totally unbecoming to her in her rank of life, and showing that she had no
      personal respect, nor&mdash;as Miss Busk styled it&mdash;"a proper sense
      of the dignity of woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'T was down at Mrs. Nelligan's, ma'am, Miss Mary was," said Mrs. Cronan's
      maid, who had been despatched special to make inquiry on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At my mother's!" exclaimed Joseph, reddening, without knowing in the
      least why. And now a new diversion occurred, while all discussed every
      possible and impossible reason for this singular fact, since the family at
      the "Nest" maintained no intercourse whatever with their neighbors, not
      even seeming, by any act of their lives, to acknowledge their very
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Nelligan took the opportunity to make his escape during the debate;
      and as the society offers nothing very attractive to detain us, it will be
      as well if we follow him, while he hastened homeward along the dark and
      storm-lashed beach. He had about a mile to go, and, short as was this
      distance, it enabled him to think over what he had just heard, strange and
      odd as it seemed to his ears. Wholly given up, as he had been for years
      past, to the ambition of a college life, with but one goal before his
      eyes, one class of topics engrossing his thoughts, he had never even
      passingly reflected on the condition of parties, the feuds of opposing
      factions, and, stronger than either, the animosities that separated social
      ranks in Ireland. Confounding the occasional slights he had experienced by
      virtue of his class, with the jealousy caused by his successes, he had
      totally overlooked the disparagement men exhibited towards the son of the
      little country shopkeeper, and never knew of his disqualification for a
      society whose precincts he had not tried to pass. The littleness, the
      unpurpose-like vacuity, the intense vulgarity of his Oughterard friends
      had disgusted him, it is true; but he had yet to learn that the foolish
      jealousy of their wealthy neighbor was a trait still less amiable, and
      ruminating over these problems,&mdash;knottier far to him than many a
      complex formula or many a disputed reading of a Greek play,&mdash;he at
      last reached the solitary little cabin where his mother lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is astonishing how difficult men of highly cultivated and actively
      practised minds find it to comprehend the little turnings and windings of
      commonplace life, the jealousies and the rivalries of small people. They
      search for motives where there are merely impulses, and look for reasons
      when there are simple passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only as he lifted the latch that he remembered how deficient he was
      in all the information his mother would expect from him. Of the fortunes
      of the whist-table he actually knew nothing; and had he been interrogated
      as to the "toilette" of the party, his answers would have betrayed a
      lamentable degree of ignorance. Fortunately for him, his mother did not
      display her habitual anxiety on these interesting themes. She neither
      asked after the Captain's winnings,&mdash;he was the terror of the party,&mdash;nor
      whether Miss Busk astonished the company by another new gown. Poor Mrs.
      Nelligan was too brimful of another subject to admit of one particle of
      extraneous matter to occupy her. With a proud consciousness, however, of
      her own resources, she affected to have thoughts for other things, and
      asked Joe if he passed a pleasant day?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, very&mdash;middling&mdash;quite so&mdash;rather stupid, I thought,"
      replied he, in his usual half-connected manner, when unable to attach his
      mind to the question before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of, course, my dear, it's very unlike what you 're used to up in Dublin,
      though I believe that Captain Bodkin, when he goes there, always dines
      with the Lord-Lieutenant; and Miss Busk, I know, is second cousin to Ram
      of Swainestown, and there is nothing better than that in Ireland. I say
      this between ourselves, for your father can't bear me to talk of family or
      connections, though I am sure I was always brought up to think a great
      deal about good blood; and if my father was a Finnerty, my mother was a
      Moore of Crockbawn, and her family never looked at her for marrying my
      father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" said Joe, in a dreamy semi-consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's true what I 'm telling you. She often said it to me herself, and
      told me what a blessing it was, through all her troubles and trials in
      life; and she had her share of them, for my father was often in drink, and
      very cruel at times. 'It supports me,' she used to say, 'to remember who I
      am, and the stock I came from, and to know that there 's not one belonging
      to me would speak to me, nor look at the same side of the road with me,
      after what I done; and, Matty,' said she to me, 'if ever it happens to you
      to marry a man beneath you in life, always bear in mind that, no matter
      how he treats you, you 're better than him.' And, indeed, it's a great
      support and comfort to one's feelings, after all," said she, with a deep
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm certain of it," muttered Joe, who had not followed one word of the
      harangue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But mind that you never tell your father so. Indeed, I would n't let on
      to him what happened this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was that?" asked the young man, roused by the increased anxiety of
      her manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a visit I had, my dear," replied the old lady, with a simpering
      consciousness that she had something to reveal,&mdash;"it was a visit I
      had paid me, and by an elegant young lady, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A young lady? Not Miss Cassidy, mother. I think she left yesterday
      morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed, my dear. Somebody very different from Miss Cassidy; and you
      might guess till you were tired before you 'd think of Miss Martin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Martin!" echoed Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly so. Miss Martin of Cro' Martin; and the way it happened was this.
      I was sitting here alone in the room after my tea,&mdash;for I sent Biddy
      out to borrow the 'Intelligence' for me; and then comes a sharp knock to
      the door, and I called out, 'Come in;' but instead of doing so there was
      another rapping, louder than before, and I said, 'Bother you, can't you
      lift the latch?' and then I heard something like a laugh, and so I went
      out; and you may guess the shame I felt as I saw a young lady fastening
      the bridle of her horse to the bar of the window. 'Mrs. Nelli-gan, I
      believe,' said she, with a smile and a look that warmed my heart to her at
      once; and as I courtesied very low, she went on. I forget, indeed, the
      words,&mdash;whether she said she was Miss Martin, or it was I that asked
      the question; but I know she came in with me to the room, and sat down
      where you are sitting now. 'Coming back from Kyle's Wood this morning,'
      said she, 'I overtook poor Billy with the post. He was obliged to go two
      miles out of his way to ford the river; and what with waiting for the
      mail, which was late in coming, and what with being wet through, he was
      completely knocked up; so I offered to take the bag for him, and send it
      over to-morrow by one of our people. But the poor fellow would n't
      consent, because he was charged with something of consequence for you,&mdash;a
      small bottle of medicine. Of course I was only too happy to take this
      also, Mrs. Nelligan, and here it is.' And with that she put it on the
      table, where you see it. I 'm sure I never knew how to thank her enough
      for her good nature, but I said all that I could think of, and told her
      that my son was just come back from college, after getting the gold
      medal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did n't speak of that, mother," said he, blushing till his very
      forehead was crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, then, I did, Joe; and I 'd like to know why I would n't. Is it a
      shame or a disgrace to us! At any rate, <i>she</i> didn't think so, for
      she said, 'You must be very proud of him;' and I told her so I was, and
      that he was as good as he was clever; and, moreover, that the newspapers
      said the time was coming when men like young Nelligan would soar their way
      up to honors and distinctions in spite of the oppressive aristocracy that
      so long had combined to degrade them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens! mother, you could n't have made such a speech as that?"
      cried he, in a voice of downright misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did n't I, then? And did n't she say, if there were any such oppression
      as could throw obstacles in the way of deserving merit, she heartily hoped
      it might prove powerless; and then she got up to wish me good-evening. I
      thought, at first, a little stiffly,&mdash;that is, more haughty in her
      manner than at first; but when I arose to see her out, and she saw I was
      lame, she pressed me down into my chair, and said, in such a kind voice,
      'You must n't stir, my dear Mrs. Nelligan. I, who can find my road over
      half of the county, can surely discover my way to the door.' 'Am I ever
      like to have the happiness of seeing you again, miss?' said I, as I held
      her hand in mine. 'Certainly, if it would give you the very slightest
      pleasure,' said she, pressing my hand most cordially; and with that we
      parted. Indeed, I scarce knew she was gone, when I heard the clattering of
      the horse over the shingle; for she was away in a gallop, dark as the
      night was. Maybe," added the old lady, with a sigh,&mdash;"maybe, I 'd
      have thought it was all a dream if it was n't that I found that glove of
      hers on the floor; she dropped it, I suppose, going out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Nelligan took up the glove with a strange feeling of bashful
      reverence. It was as though he was touching a sacred relic; and he stood
      gazing on it steadfastly for some seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll send it over to the house by Biddy, with my compliments, and to
      know how the family is, in the morning," said Mrs. Nelligan, with the air
      of one who knew the value of conventional usages.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she 'll make some stupid blunder or other," replied Joe, impatiently,
      "that will cover us all with shame. No, mother, I 'd rather go with it
      myself than that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure, and why not?" said Mrs. Nelligan. "There 's no reason why <i>you</i>
      should be taking up old quarrels against the Martins; for <i>my</i> part,
      I never knew the country so pleasant as it used to be long ago, when we
      used to get leave to go picnicking on the grounds of Cro' Martin, up to
      the Hermitage, as they called it; and now the gates are locked and barred
      like a jail, and nobody allowed in without a ticket."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I'll go myself with it," said Joe, who heard nothing of his mother's
      remark, but was following out the tract of his own speculations. As little
      did he attend to the various suggestions she threw out for his guidance
      and direction, the several topics to which he might, and those to which he
      must not, on any account, allude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a word, for your life, Joe, about the right of pathway to Clune
      Abbey, and take care you say nothing about the mill-race at Glandaff, nor
      the shooting in Kyle's Wood. And if by any chance there should be a talk
      about the tolls at Oughterard, say you never heard of them before. Make
      out, in fact," said she, summing up, "as if you never heard of a county
      where there was so much good-will and kindness between the people; and
      sure it is n't your fault if it's not true!" And with this philosophic
      reflection Mrs. Nelligan wished her son good-night, and retired.

      CHAPTER III. AN AUTUMN MORNING IN THE WEST
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Osprey's Nest was, I have said, like a direct challenge hurled at the
      face of western gales and Atlantic storms. With what success, its aspect
      of dilapidation and decay but too plainly betrayed. The tangled seaweed
      that hung in dripping festoons over the porch, the sea-shells that rattled
      against the window-panes, seemed like an angry denunciation of the attempt
      to brave the elements by the mere appliances of ease and luxury.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was better, however, in the inside, where, in a roomy apartment, most
      comfortably furnished, a lady and gentleman sat at breakfast. The table
      stood in a little projection of the room, admitting of a wide sea-view
      over the bay and the distant islands of Lettermullen, but as carefully
      excluded all prospect of the port,&mdash;a locality which held no high
      place in the esteem of the lady of the house, and which, by ignoring, she
      half fancied she had annihilated. Wild promontories of rocks, jutting out
      here and there, broke the coast line, and marked the shore with a foaming
      stream of white water, as the ever-restless sea dashed over them. The long
      booming swell of the great ocean bounded into many a rocky cavern, with a
      loud report like thunder, and issued forth again with a whole cataract of
      falling stones, that rattled like the crash of small-arms. It was
      unceasing, deafening clamor in the midst of death-like desolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me, however, turn once more to the scene within, and present the
      living elements to my reader. They were both past the prime of life. The
      lady might still be called handsome; her features were perfectly regular,
      and finely cut, bearing the impress of a proud and haughty spirit that
      never quailed beneath the conflict of a long life, and even yet showed a
      firm front to fortune. Her hair was white as snow; and as she wore it
      drawn back, after the fashion of a bygone time, it gave her the air of a
      fine lady of the old French Court, in all the pomp of powder and pomatum.
      Nor did her dress correct the impression, since the deep falls of lace
      that covered her hands, the lengthy stomacher, and trailing folds of her
      heavy brocade gown, all showed a lurking fondness for the distinctive
      toilette of that era. Lady Dorothea Martin had been a beauty and an earl's
      daughter; two facts that not even the seclusion of the wild west could
      erase from her memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Martin himself was no unworthy "pendant" to this portrait. He was tall
      and stately, with a lofty forehead, and temples finely and well fashioned;
      while full, deep-set blue eyes of the very sternest determination, and a
      mouth, every line of which betrayed firmness, gave the character to a face
      that also could expand into the most genial good-fellowship, and become at
      times the symbol of a pleasant and convivial Irish gentleman. In his youth
      he had been a beau of the Court of Versailles. Scandal had even coupled
      his name with that of Marie Antoinette; and more truthful narratives
      connected him with some of the most extravagant adventures of that
      profligate and brilliant period. After a career of the wildest dissipation
      and excess, he had married, late in life, the daughter of the Earl of
      Exmere, one of the proudest and poorest names in the British Peerage. Two
      or three attempts to shine in the world of London,&mdash;not as successful
      as they were expected to have proved,&mdash;an effort at ascendancy in
      Irish political life, also a failure, coupled with disappointment on the
      score of an only brother, who had married beneath him, and was reputed to
      have "lost himself," seemed to have disgusted Godfrey Martin with the
      world, and he had retired to his lonely mansion in the west, which now for
      eighteen years he had scarcely quitted for a single day.
    </p>
    <p>
      His only son had joined a cavalry regiment in India a few years before the
      period our story opens, and which, I may now state, dates for about four
      or five and twenty years back; but his family included a niece, the only
      child of his brother, and whose mother had died in giving her birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between Mr. Martin and Lady Dorothea, as they sat at breakfast, little
      conversation passed. He occupied himself with the newly arrived
      newspapers, and she perused a mass of letters which had just come by that
      morning's post; certain scraps of the intelligence gleaned from either of
      these sources forming the only subjects of conversation between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So they have resolved to have a new Parliament. I knew it would come to
      that; I always said so; and, as usual, the dissolution finds us
      unprepared."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plantagenet's regiment is ordered to Currachee, wherever that may be,"
      said Lady Dorothea, languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call him Harry, and we shall save ourselves some trouble in discussing
      him," replied he, pettishly. "At all events, he cannot possibly be here in
      time for the contest; and we must, I suppose, give our support to
      Kilmorris again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean, after his conduct about the harbor, and the shameful way he
      sneaked out of the Port Martin project?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Find anything better, madam; there is the difficulty. Kilmorris is a
      gentleman, and no Radical; and, as times go, these are rather rare
      qualities."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Sarah Upton's match is off," said Lady Dorothea, reading from a note
      beside her. "Sir Joseph insisted upon the uncontrolled possession of all
      her Staffordshire property."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And perfectly right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly wrong to give it to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fool if he married without it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A mean creature she, to accept him on such terms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The woman is eight-and-thirty,&mdash;if not more. I remember her at
      Tunbridge. Let me see, what year was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I detest dates, and abhor chronologies. Reach me the marmalade," said
      Lady Dorothea, superciliously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's this balderdash here from the 'Galway Indicator'? 'The haughty and
      insolent, aye, and ignorant aristocracy will have to swallow a bitter
      draught erelong; and such petty despots as Martin of Cro' Martin will
      learn that the day is gone by for their ascendancy in this county.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "They tell me we have a law of libel in the land; and yet see how this
      scoundrel can dare to drag me by name before the world; and I 'll wager a
      thousand pounds I 'd fail to get a verdict against him if I prosecuted him
      to-morrow," said Martin, as he dashed the newspaper to the ground, and
      stamped his foot upon it. "We are constantly reading diatribes about
      absentee landlords, and the evils of neglected property; but I ask, what
      inducements are there held out to any gentleman to reside on his estate,
      if every petty scribbler of the press can thus attack and assail him with
      impunity?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that Mary I see yonder?" asked Lady Dorothea, languidly, as she lifted
      her double eye-glass, and then suffered it to fall from her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is, by Jove!" cried Martin, springing up, and approaching the
      window. "I wish she 'd not venture out in that small boat in this
      treacherous season. What a swell there is, too! The wind is from the sea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's coming in, I fancy," drawled out Lady Dorothea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is she to do it, though?" exclaimed he, hurriedly; "the sea is
      breaking clear over the piers of the harbor. I can only see one man in the
      boat. What rashness! what folly! There, look, they're standing out to sea
      again!" And now, throwing open the window, Martin stepped out on the
      rocks, over which the white foam flashed by like snow. "What are they at,
      Peter? What are they trying to do?" cried he to an old fisherman, who,
      with the coil of a net he was just mending on his arm, had now come down
      to the shore to watch the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They 're doing right, your honor," said he, touching his cap
      respectfully. "'Tis Loony my Lady has in the boat, and there's no better
      man in trouble! He's just going to beat out a bit, and then he 'll run in
      under the shelter of the blue rocks. Faix, she 's a fine boat, then, for
      her size,&mdash;look at her now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Martin had covered his eyes with his hand, while his lips murmured and
      moved rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I never, but they 're letting out the reef!" screamed the old man in
      terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "More sail, and in such a sea!" cried Martin, in a voice of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye, and right, too," said the fisherman, after a pause; "she 's rising
      lighter over the sea, and steers better, besides. It's Miss Mary has the
      tiller," added the old fellow, with a smile. "I 'll lay a shilling she 's
      singing this minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think so," said Martin, glad to catch at this gleam of confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it well, your honor. I remember one day, off Lettermullen, it was
      worse than this. Hurrah!" screamed he out suddenly; "she took in a great
      sea that time!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get out a boat, Peter, at once; what are we standing here for?" cried
      Martin, angrily. "Man a boat this instant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure no boat could get out to sea with this wind, sir," remonstrated the
      old man, mildly; "she'd never leave the surf if she had forty men at her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what's to be done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just let them alone; themselves two know as well what to do as any pair
      in Ireland, and are as cool besides. There, now, she 's putting her about,
      as I said, and she 'll run for the creek." The frail boat, a mere speck
      upon the dark green ocean, seemed now to fly, as with a slackened sheet
      she darted over the water. Her course was bent for a little cove concealed
      from view by a rugged promontory of rock, up which the old fisherman now
      clambered with the alacrity of a younger man. Martin tried to follow; but
      overcome by emotion, he was unable, and sat down upon a ledge of rock,
      burying his face within his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the whole fishing population of the little village had
      gathered on the beach around the cove, to watch the boat as she came in;
      numbers had gone out to meet her, and stood up to their waists in the
      white and boiling surf, ready to seize upon the skiff and run her high and
      dry upon the sand. Even they were obliged to be lashed together by a rope,
      lest the receding waves should carry them out to sea, or the "under tow"
      suck them beneath the surface. As the boat came within speaking distance,
      a wild shout arose from the shore to "down sail" and suffer her to come in
      on her way alone; but with all the canvas spread, they came flying along,
      scarce seeming more than to tip the waves as they skipped over them, while
      a shower of spray appeared to cover them as the sea broke upon the stern.
      Instead of rendering aid, the utmost the fishermen could do was to clear a
      path amongst them for the skiff to pass, as with lightning speed she
      flitted by and drove her bow high up on the hard beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wild, glad cheer of joy and welcome burst from the hearty fishermen as
      they crowded about the young girl, who stepped out of the boat with a
      heavy bundle in her arms. Her hair hung in great masses over her neck and
      shoulders, her cheeks were flushed, and her dark eyes gleamed with all the
      excitement of peril and triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, Margaret," said she to a young woman, who, pale with terror and
      with face streaming in tears, rushed towards her,&mdash;"here 's your
      little fellow, all safe and sound; I 'd not have put back but for his
      sake." And with this she placed in his mother's arms a little boy of about
      three years of age, sound asleep. "He must wait for better weather if he
      wants to see his grandmother. And," added she, laughing, "I scarcely think
      you 'll catch me going to sea again with so precious a cargo. Poor little
      man!" and she patted his ruddy cheeks; "he behaved so well, like a stout
      fisherman's son as he is,&mdash;never showed fear for a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of delighted hearts ran through the crowd; some thinking of the
      child, but many more in warm admiration of the brave and beautiful young
      girl before them. "Loony," said she to her boatman, "when you 've got the
      tackle to rights, come up to the house for your breakfast." And with that,
      and a few words of grateful recognition as she passed, she clambered up
      the rock and hastened homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for her uncle, no sooner had he heard of her safe arrival on shore than
      he hurried back, anxious to reach the house before her. For a considerable
      time back Martin had schooled himself into an apparent indifference about
      his niece's perils. Lady Dorothea had probably given the initiative to
      this feeling by constantly asserting that the young lady would incur few
      risks when they ceased to create alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a somewhat ungracious theory, and excited in Martin's mind, when he
      first heard it, a sensation the very reverse of agreeable. Without
      accepting its truth, however, it made a deep impression upon him, and at
      last, by way of policy, he resolved to feign a degree of callous
      indifference very foreign to his nature; and, by dint of mere habit, he at
      length acquired a semblance of calm under circumstances that sorely tested
      his powers of self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has the heroine arrived safe on shore?" asked Lady Dorothea in her own
      languid drawl. And Martin almost started at the question, and seemed for a
      moment as if the indignation it excited could not be repressed; then
      smiling superciliously at the impassive air of her features, he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and by rare good luck, too! The sea is a terrific one this morning!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it ever anything else in this heavenly climate?" said she, sighing. "I
      have counted two fine days since the 8th of June; and, indeed, it rained a
      little on one of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin winced impatiently under the remark, but never lifted his eyes from
      the newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had hoped your niece was making arrangements for our return to Cro'
      Martin," said she, querulously, "instead of planning marine excursions. I
      told her yesterday, or the day before,&mdash;I forget which; but who could
      remember time in such a place?&mdash;that I was bored to death here. The
      observation seems to amuse you, Mr. Martin; but it is a simple fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are bored to death at Cro' Martin, too, if I mistake not?" said
      he, with a very significant dryness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think I was, sir; and nothing very astonishing in the
      confession, besides."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Dublin, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't speak of it. If one must endure prison discipline, at least let us
      have a cell to ourselves. Good-morning, Miss Martin. I hope you enjoyed
      your party on the water?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This speech was addressed to Mary, who now entered the room dressed in a
      plain morning costume, and in her quiet, almost demure look resembling in
      nothing the dripping and dishevelled figure that sprung from the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning, aunt," said she, gayly. "Good-morning, uncle," kissing, as
      she spoke, his cheek, and patting him fondly on the shoulder. "I saw you
      out on the rocks as we were coming in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh, pooh!" said he, in affected indifference. "I knew there was no
      danger&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but there was, though," said she, quickly. "If we had n't set all
      sail on her, she 'd have been pooped to a certainty; and I can tell you I
      was in a rare fright, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, indeed; you confess to such an ignoble emotion?" said Lady Dorothea,
      with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I do, aunt, for I had poor Madge Lennan's little boy on my lap all
      the time; and if it came to a swim, I don't see how he was to be saved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 'd not have left him to his fate, I suppose?" said Lady Dorothea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I scarcely know what I should have done. I sincerely hope it would have
      been my best; but in a moment like that, within sight of home, too&mdash;"
      Her eyes met her uncle's as she said this; he had raised them from his
      newspaper, and bent them fully on her. There was that in their expression
      which appealed so strongly to her heart that instead of finishing her
      speech she sprung towards him and threw her arms around his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite a scene; and I detest scenes," said Lady Dorothen, as she arose and
      swept out of the room contemptuously; but they neither heard the remark
      nor noticed her departure.

      CHAPTER IV. MAURICE SCANLAN, ATTORNEY-AT-LAW.
    </h2>
    <p>
      About an hour after the occurrence mentioned in our last chapter, the
      quiet little village of Kilkieran was startled by the sharp clattering
      sounds of horses' feet, as Mr. Scanlan's tandem came slinging along; and
      after various little dexterities amid stranded boats, disabled anchors,
      and broken capstans, drew up at the gate of the Osprey's Nest. When men
      devise their own equipage, they invariably impart to it a strong infusion
      of their own idiosyncrasy. The quiet souls who drag through life in
      chocolate-colored barouches, with horses indifferently matched, give no
      clew to their special characteristics; but your men of tax-carts and
      tandems, your Jehus of four-in-hand teams, write their own biographies in
      every detail of the "turn-out."

    <p>
      Maurice Scanlan was a sporting attorney, and from the group of game cocks
      neatly painted on the hind panel, to the wiry, well-bred, and well-looking
      screws before him, all was indicative of the man. The conveyance was high
      and red-wheeled; the nags were a chestnut and a gray; he drove them
      without winkers or bearing-reins, wearing his white hat a very little on
      ope side, and gracefully tilting his elbow as he admonished the wheeler
      with the "crop" of his whip. He was a good-looking, showy, vulgar,
      self-sufficient kind of fellow, with consummate shrewdness in all business
      transactions, only marred by one solitary weak point,&mdash;an intense
      desire to be received intimately by persons of a station above his own,
      and to seem, at least, to be the admitted guest of very fashionable
      society. It was not a very easy matter to know if this Lord-worship of his
      was real, or merely affected, since, certainly, the profit he derived from
      the assumption was very considerable, and Maurice was intrusted with a
      variety of secret-service transactions, and private affairs for the
      nobility, which they would never have dreamed of committing to the hands
      of their more recognized advisers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If men would have been slow to engage his services in any grave or
      important suit, he was invaluable in all the ordinary and constantly
      occurring events of this changeful world. He knew every one's difficulties
      and embarrassments. There was not a hitch in a settlement, nor a spavin in
      your stables, could escape him. He seemed to possess a kind of intuitive
      appreciation of a flaw; and he pounced upon a defect with a rapidity that
      counterfeited genius. To these gifts he added a consummate knowledge of
      his countrymen. He had emerged from the very humblest class of the people,
      and he knew them thoroughly; with all their moods of habitual distrust and
      momentary enthusiasm,&mdash;with all their phases of sanguine hopefulness
      he was familiar; and he could mould and fashion and weld them to his will,
      as passive subjects as the heated bar under the hammer of the smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an electioneering agent he was unequalled. It was precisely the sphere
      in which his varied abilities were best exercised; and it was, besides, an
      arena in which he was proud of figuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while he seemed&mdash;at least in his own eyes&mdash;to stand on a
      higher eminence than the candidate he represented, and to be a more
      prominent and far grander personage than his principal. In fact, it was
      only under some tacit acknowledgment of this temporary supremacy that his
      services were obtainable; his invariable stipulation being that he was to
      have the entire and uncontrolled direction of the election.
    </p>
    <p>
      Envious tongues and ungenerous talkers did, indeed, say that Maurice
      insisted upon this condition with very different objects in view, and that
      his unlimited powers found their pleasantest exercise in the inexplorable
      realms of secret bribery; however, it is but fair to say that he was
      eminently successful, and that one failure alone in his whole career
      occurred to show the proverbial capriciousness of fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the little borough of Oughterard he had become so identified that his
      engagement was regarded as one of the first elements of success. Hitherto,
      indeed, the battle had been always an easy one. The Liberal party&mdash;as
      they pleasantly assumed to style themselves&mdash;had gone no further in
      opposition than an occasional burst of intemperate language, and an effort&mdash;usually
      a failure&mdash;at a street row during the election. So little of either
      energy or organization had marked their endeavors, that the great leader
      of the day had stigmatized their town with terms of heavy censure, and
      even pronounced them unworthy of the cause. An emissary, deputed to report
      upon the political state of the borough, had described the voters as mere
      dependants on the haughty purse-proud proprietor of Cro' Martin, who
      seemed, even without an effort, to nominate the sitting member.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great measure of the year '29&mdash;the Catholic Relief Bill&mdash;had
      now, however, suggested to even more apathetic constituencies the prospect
      of a successful struggle. The thought of being represented by "one of
      their own sort" was no mean stimulant to exertion; and the leading spirits
      of the place had frequently conferred together as to what steps should be
      taken to rescue the borough from the degrading thraldom of an aristocratic
      domination. Lord Kilmorris, it is true, was rather popular with them than
      the reverse. The eldest son of an Earl, who only cared to sit in
      Parliament on easy terms, till the course of time and events should call
      him to the Upper House, he never took any very decided political line, but
      sat on Tory benches and gave an occasional vote to Liberal measures, as
      though foreshadowing that new school who were to take the field under the
      middle designation of Conservatives. Some very remote relationship to Lady
      Dorothea's family had first introduced him to the Martins' notice; and
      partly from this connection, and partly because young Harry Martin was too
      young to sit in Parliament, they had continued to support him to the
      present time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Martin himself cared very little for politics; had he even cared more,
      he would not have sacrificed to them one jot of that indolent, lazy,
      apathetic existence which alone he seemed to prize. He was rather grateful
      than otherwise to Lord Kilmorris for taking upon him the trouble of a
      contest, if there should be such a thing. His greatest excuse through
      life, at least to himself, had ever been that he was "unprepared." He had
      been in that unhappy state about everything since he was born, and so,
      apparently, was he destined to continue to the very last. With large
      resources, he was never prepared for any sudden demand for money. When
      called on for any exertion of mind or body, when asked to assist a friend
      or rescue a relation from difficulty, he was quite unprepared; and so
      convinced was he that this was a fatality under which he labored, that no
      sooner had he uttered the expression than he totally absolved himself from
      every shadow of reproach that might attach to his luke-warmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The uncontrolled position he occupied, joined to the solitary isolation in
      which he lived, had doubtless engendered this cold and heartless theory.
      There was no one to dispute his will,&mdash;none to gainsay his opinions.
      There was not for him any occasion for the healthful exertion which is
      evoked by opposition, and he sunk gradually down into a moping, listless,
      well-meaning, but utterly good-for-nothing gentleman, who would have been
      marvellously amazed had any one arraigned him for neglect of his station
      and its great requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      That such an insolent possibility could be, was only demonstrated to him
      in that morning's newspaper. To be called a despot was bad enough, but a
      petty despot,&mdash;and to be told that such despotism was already doomed&mdash;aroused
      in him a degree of indignation all the more painful that the sensation was
      one he had not experienced for many a year back. Whose fault was it that
      such an impertinence had ever been uttered? Doubtless, Kilmorris's. Some
      stupid speech, some absurd vote, some ridiculous party move had brought
      down this attack upon him; or perhaps it was Mary, with her new-fangled
      ideas about managing the estate, her school-houses, and her model-farms.
      The ignorant people had possibly revolted against her interference; or it
      might be Lady Dorothea herself, whose haughty manner had given offence; at
      all events, <i>he</i> was blameless, and strange to say, either he was not
      perfectly assured of the fact, or that the assumption was not pleasant,
      but he seemed very far from being satisfied with the explanation. In the
      agitated mood these feelings produced, a servant came to inform him that
      Mr. Scanlan had just arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say I 'm out&mdash;I 'm unwell&mdash;I don't feel quite myself to-day.
      Call Miss Mary to him." And with an impatient gesture he motioned the
      servant away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Mary will be down in a few minutes, sir," said the man, entering the
      room where Mr. Scanlan stood arranging his whiskers before the
      chimney-glass, and contemplating with satisfaction his general appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was Mr. Martin himself, Thomas, that I wanted to see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that, sir, but the Master is n't well this morning; he told me to
      send Miss Mary to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," said Scanlan, giving a finishing touch to the tie of his
      cravat, and then gracefully bestowing his person into an easy-chair. To
      common observation he looked perfectly unconcerned in every gesture, and
      yet no man felt less at his ease at that moment than Mr. Maurice Scanlan;
      and though the cause involves something like a secret, the reader shall
      know it. Mr. Scanlan had seen a good deal of the world&mdash;that is, of
      <i>his</i> world. He had mixed with barristers and solicitors, "Silk
      Gowns," masters in Chancery, and even puisne judges had he come into
      contact with; he had mingled in turf experiences with certain sporting
      lords and baronets, swapped horses, and betted and handicapped with men of
      fortune; he had driven trotting-matches, and ridden hurdle-races against
      young heirs to good estates, and somehow always found himself not inferior
      in worldly craft and address to those he came in contact with,&mdash;nay,
      he even fancied that he was occasionally rather a little more wide awake
      than his opponents; and what with a little blustering here, a little
      blarney there, a dash of mock frankness to this man, or an air of
      impulsive generosity to the other,&mdash;an accommodating elasticity, in
      fact, that extended to morals, manners, and principles,&mdash;he found
      that he was, as he himself styled it, "a fair match with equal weights for
      anything going." There was but one individual alone in presence of whom he
      in reality felt his own inferiority deeply and painfully; strange to say,
      that was Miss Martin! At first sight this would seem almost
      unintelligible. She was not either a haughty beauty, presuming on the
      homage bestowed upon her by high and distinguished admirers, nor was she
      any greatly gifted and cultivated genius dominating over lesser
      intelligences by the very menace of her acquirements. She was simply a
      high-spirited, frank, unaffected girl, whose good breeding and good sense
      seemed alike instinctive, and who read with almost intuition the shallow
      artifices by which such natures as Scanlan's impose upon the world. She
      had seen him easily indolent with her uncle, obsequiously deferential to
      my Lady, all in the same breath, while the side-look of tyranny he could
      throw a refractory tenant appeared just as congenial to his nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some strange consciousness which told him he could not deceive <i>her</i>,
      that made Scanlan ever abashed in her presence, and by the self-same
      impulse was it that she was the only one in the world for whose good
      esteem he would have sacrificed all he possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he waited for her coming, he took a leisurely survey of the room.
      The furniture, less costly and rich than at Cro' Martin, was all marked by
      that air of propriety and comfort so observable in rich men's houses.
      There were the hundred appliances of ease and luxury that show how
      carefully the most trifling inconveniences are warded off, and the course
      of daily life rendered as untroubled as mere material enjoyments can
      secure. Scanlan sighed deeply, for the thought crossed his mind how was a
      girl brought up in this way ever to stoop to ally her fortune to a man
      like him? Was it, then, possible that he nourished such a presumption?
      Even so. Maurice was of an aspiring turn; he had succeeded in twenty
      things that a dozen years past he had never dared to dream of. He had
      dined at tables and driven with men whose butlers and valets he once
      deemed very choice company; he had been the guest at houses where once his
      highest ambition had been to see the interior as a matter of curiosity.
      "Who could say where he might be at last?" Besides this, he knew from his
      own knowledge of family matters that she had no fortune, that her father
      was infinitely more likely to leave debts than an inheritance behind him,
      and that her uncle was the last man in the world ever to think of a
      marriage-portion for one he could not afford to part with. There was,
      then, no saying what turn of fortune might present him in an admissible
      form as a suitor. At all events, there was no rival in the field, and
      Maurice had seen many a prize won by a "walk over" purely for want of a
      competitor in the race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding all these very excellent and reassuring considerations,
      Maurice Scanlan could not overcome a most uncomfortable sense of
      awkwardness as Mary Martin entered the room, and saluting him with easy
      familiarity, said, "I'm quite ashamed of having made you wait, Mr.
      Scanlan; but I was in the village when I got my uncle's message. I find
      that he is not well enough to receive you, and if I can&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure it's only too much honor you do me, Miss Mary; I never expected
      to have the pleasure of this interview; indeed, it will be very hard for
      me to think of business, at all, at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would be most unfortunate after your coming so far on account of
      it," said she, half archly, while she seated herself on a sofa at some
      distance from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it were a question about the estate, Miss Mary," said he, in his most
      obsequious manner, "there's nobody equal to yourself; or if it were
      anything at all but what it is, I know well that you'd see your way out of
      it; but the present is a matter of politics,&mdash;it 's about the
      borough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That weary borough," said she, sighing; "and are we about to have another
      election?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That 's it, Miss Mary; and Lord Kilmorris writes me to say that he 'll be
      over next week, and hopes he 'll find all his friends here as well
      disposed towards him as ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he written to my uncle?" asked Mary, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; and that's exactly what I came about. There was a kind of coldness,&mdash;more
      my Lady's, I think, than on Mr. Martin's part,&mdash;and Lord Kilmorris
      feels a kind of delicacy; in fact, he doesn't rightly know how he stands
      at Cro' Martin." Here he paused, in hopes that she would help him by even
      a word; but she was perfectly silent and attentive, and he went on. "So
      that, feeling himself embarrassed, and at the same time knowing how much
      he owes to the Martin interest&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, go on," said she, calmly, as he came a second time to a dead stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't so easy, then, Miss Mary," said he, with a long sigh, "for there
      are so many things enter into it,&mdash;so much of politics and party and
      what not,&mdash;that I quite despair of making myself intelligible,
      though, perhaps, if I was to see your uncle, he 'd make out my meaning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I try and induce him to receive you, then?" said she, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, I don't like asking it," said he, doubtfully; "for, after
      all, there's nobody can break it to him as well as yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Break it to him, Mr. Scanlan?" said she, in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, it 's the very word, then," said he; "for do what one will, say
      what they may, it will be sure to surprise him, if it does no worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You alarm me, sir; and yet I feel that if you would speak boldly out your
      meaning, there is probably no cause for fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll just do so, then, Miss Mary; but at the same time I 'd have you to
      understand that I 'm taking a responsibility on myself that his Lordship
      never gave me any warrant for, and that there is not another&mdash;" Mr.
      Scanlan stopped, but only in time; for, whether it was the fervor in which
      he uttered these words, or that Miss Martin anticipated what was about to
      follow, her cheek became scarlet, and a most unmistakable expression of
      her eyes recalled the worthy practitioner to all his wonted caution. "The
      matter is this, Miss Martin," said he, with a degree of deference more
      marked than before, "Lord Kilmorris is dissatisfied with the way your
      uncle supported him at the last election. He complains of the hard
      conditions imposed upon him as to his line of conduct in the House; and,
      above all, he feels insulted by a letter Lady Dorothea wrote him, full of
      very harsh expressions and hard insinuations. I never saw it myself, but
      that's his account of it,&mdash;in fact, he's very angry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And means to throw up the borough, in short," broke in Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid not, Miss Mary," said the other, in a half whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What then?&mdash;what can he purpose doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He means to try and come in on his own interest," said Scanlan, who
      uttered the words with an effort, and seemed to feel relief when they were
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I to understand that he would contest the borough with us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Scanlan nodded an affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, Mr. Scanlan, this is some mistake,&mdash;some misapprehension on
      your part. His Lordship may very possibly feel aggrieved,&mdash;he may
      have some cause, for aught I know,&mdash;about something in the last
      election, but this mode of resenting it is quite out of the question,&mdash;downright
      impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best way is to read his own words. Miss Martin. There's his letter,"
      said he, handing one towards her, which, however, she made no motion to
      take.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you won't read it, then, perhaps you will permit me to do so. It's
      very short, too, for he says at the end he will write more fully
      to-morrow." Mr. Scanlan here muttered over several lines of the epistle,
      until he came to the following: "I am relieved from any embarrassment I
      should have felt at breaking with the Martins by reflecting over the
      altered conditions of party, and the new aspect politics must assume by
      the operations of the Emancipation Act. The old ways and traditions of the
      Tories must be abandoned at once and forever; and though Martin in his
      life of seclusion and solitude will not perceive this necessity, we here
      all see and admit it. I could, therefore, no longer represent his
      opinions, since they would find no echo in the House. To stand for the
      borough I must stand on my own views, which, I feel bold to say, include
      justice to both of the contending factions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admirably argued," broke in Mary. "He absolves himself from all ties of
      gratitude to my uncle by adopting principles the reverse of all he ever
      professed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very like that, indeed, Miss Mary," said Scanlan, timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very like it, sir? it is exactly so. Really the thing would be too gross
      if it were not actually laughable;" and as she spoke she arose and paced
      the room in a manner that showed how very little of the ludicrous side of
      the matter occupied her thoughts. "He will stand for the borough&mdash;he
      means to stand in opposition to us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's his intention&mdash;at least, if Mr. Martin should not come to the
      conclusion that it is better to support his Lordship than risk throwing
      the seat into the hands of the Roman Catholics."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't follow all these intrigues, Mr. Scanlan. I confess to you,
      frankly, that you have puzzled me enough already, and that I have found it
      no small strain on my poor faculties to conceive a gentleman being able to
      argue himself into any semblance of self-approval by such sentiments as
      those which you have just read; but I am a poor country girl, very
      ignorant of great topics and great people. The best thing I can do is to
      represent this affair to my uncle, and as early as may be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope he'll not take the thing to heart, miss; and I trust he 'll acquit
      <i>me</i>&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be assured he'll despise the whole business most thoroughly, sir. I never
      knew him take any deep interest in these themes; and if this be a fair
      specimen of the way they are discussed, he was all the wiser for his
      indifference. Do you make any stay in the village? Will it be inconvenient
      for you to remain an hour or so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll wait your convenience, miss, to any hour," said Scanlan, with an air
      of gallantry which, had she been less occupied with her thoughts, might
      have pushed her hard to avoid smiling at.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be down at Mrs. Cronan's till I hear from you, Miss Mary." And with
      a look of as much deferential admiration as he dared to bestow, Scanlan
      took his leave, and mounting to his box, assumed the ribbons with a
      graceful elegance and a certain lackadaisical languor that, to himself at
      least, appeared demonstrative of an advanced stage of the tender passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begad, she's a fine girl; devil a lie in it, but she has n't her equal!
      and as sharp as a needle, too," muttered he, as he jogged along the
      shingly beach, probably for the first time in his whole life forgetting
      the effect he was producing on the bystanders.

      CHAPTER V. A STUDIO AND AN ARTIST
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Is my uncle in the library, Terence?" asked Mary of a very corpulent old
      man, in a red-brown wig.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, miss, he's in the&mdash;bother it, then, if I ever can think of the
      name of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The studio, you mean," said she, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so, Miss Mary," replied he, with a sigh; for he remembered certain
      penitential hours passed by himself in the same locality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think you could manage to let him know I want him&mdash;that is,
      that I have something important to say to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's clean impossible, miss, to get near him when he's there. Sure, is
      n't he up on a throne, dressed out in goold and dimonds, and as cross as a
      badger besides, at the way they're tormenting him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that tiresome picture, is it never to be completed?" muttered she,
      half unconsciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The saints above know whether it is or no," rejoined Terence, "for one of
      the servants told me yesterday that they rubbed every bit of the master
      out, and began him all again; for my Lady said he was n't half haggard
      enough, or worn-looking; but, by my conscience, if he goes on as he 's
      doing, he ought to satisfy them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I thought it was Henderson was sitting," said Mary, somewhat amused
      at the old man's commentaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he was; but they rubbed him out, too; for it seems now he ought to be
      bald, and they 've sent him into Oughter-ard to get his head shaved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what were <i>you</i>, Terry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arrah, who knows?" said he, querulously. "At first I was to be somebody's
      mother that was always cryin'; but they weren't pleased with the way I
      done it; and then they made me a monk, and after that they put two
      hundredweight of armor on me, and made me lean my head on my arm as if I
      was overcome; and faith, so I was; for I dropped off asleep, and fell into
      a pot of varnish, and I 'm in disgrace now, glory be to God! and I only
      hope it may last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I shared your fortune, Terry, with all my heart," said Mary, with
      some difficulty preserving her gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't it catch fire&mdash;by accident, I mean, miss&mdash;some evening
      after dark?" whispered Terry, confidentially. "Them 's materials that
      would burn easy! for, upon my conscience, if it goes on much longer there
      won't be a sarvant will stay in the sarvice. They had little Tom Regan
      holding a dish of charcoal so long that he tuk to his bed on Friday last,
      and was never up since; and Jinny Moore says she 'd rather lave the place
      than wear that undacent dress; and whist, there's murder goin' on now
      inside!" And with that the old fellow waddled off with a speed that seemed
      quite disproportionate to his years.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Mary was still hesitating as to what she should do, the door
      suddenly opened, and a man in a mediaeval costume rushed out, tugging
      after him a large bloodhound, whose glaring eyeballs and frothy mouth
      betokened intense passion. Passing hurriedly forward, Mary beheld Lady
      Dorothea bending over the fainting figure of a short little man, who lay
      on the floor; while her uncle, tottering under a costume he could barely
      carry, was trying to sprinkle water over him from an urn three feet in
      height.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Crow has fainted,&mdash;mere fright, nothing more!" said Lady
      Dorothea. "In stepping backward from the canvas he unluckily trod upon
      Fang's paw, and the savage creature at once sprung on him. That stupid
      wretch, Regan, one of your favorites, Miss Martin, never pulled him off
      till he had torn poor Mr. Crow's coat, clean in two.".
    </p>
    <p>
      "Egad, if I had n't smashed my sceptre over the dog's head the mischief
      wouldn't have stopped there; but he 's coming to. Are you better, Crow?
      How do you feel, man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you are better, sir?" said Lady Dorothea, in an admirable blending
      of grand benevolence and condescension.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0003" id="linkimage-0003">

    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/080.jpg" width="100%" alt="080 " />
    </div>
    <p>
      "Infinitely better; supremely happy, besides, to have become the object of
      your Ladyship's kind inquiries," said the little man, sitting up, and
      looking around with a very ghastly effort at urbanity and ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never knew Fang to bite any one," said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does n't she, by jingo!" exclaimed the artist, who with difficulty caught
      himself in time before he placed his hand on the supposed seat of his
      injuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She shall be muzzled in future," said Lady Dorothea, haughtily,
      repressing the familiar tone of the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think&mdash;indeed, I feel sure&mdash;I could get her in from memory,
      my Lady; she 's a very remarkable creature, and makes an impression on
      one." As he uttered these words ruefully, he lifted from the floor the
      fragment of his coat-skirt, and gazed mournfully at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose we must suspend proceedings," said Lady Dorothea; "though
      really it is a pity to lose the opportunity of Miss Martin's presence,&mdash;an
      honor she so very rarely accords us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think after a few minutes or so, my Lady, I might feel equal," said Mr.
      Crow, rising and retreating to a wall with a degree of caution that showed
      he entertained grave fears as to the state of his habiliments,&mdash;"I
      might feel equal, if not exactly to delineate Miss Martin's Classic
      features, at least to throw in&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could n't think of such a thing; I should be wretched at the idea of
      engaging your attention at such a moment," said Mary, with a carelessness
      that contrasted strongly with her words; while she added, with
      earnestness, "Besides, I 'm not sure I could spare the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, sir," said her Ladyship to the artist, "you have to deal with a
      young lady whose occupations are like those of a Premier. The Duke of
      Wellington can vouchsafe a sitting for his portrait, but Miss Martin
      cannot spare the time for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, Aunt Dorothy, if I were the Duke of Wellington I should do as he
      does. It is being Mary Martin, whose picture can have no interest for any
      one, enables me to follow the bent of my own wishes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humility is another of her perfections," said Lady Dorothea, with a look
      that but too palpably expressed her feeling towards her niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mary was assisting her uncle to get rid of some of his superfluous
      draperies, neither of them overheard this remark; while Mr. Crow was too
      deeply impressed with his own calamities to pay any attention to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Scanlan has been very anxious to see you, uncle," whispered Mary in
      his ear. "He has something of importance to communicate about the
      borough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't you manage it yourself, Molly? Can't you contrive somehow to spare
      me this annoyance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you really ought to hear what he has to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I perceive that Miss Martin has a secret of moment to Impart to you; pray
      let me not trouble the interview by my presence," said Lady Dorothea. And
      she swept haughtily out of the room, throwing a most disdainful glance at
      her husband as she went.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, by George! you've secured me a pleasant afternoon, at all events!"
      said Martin, angrily, to his niece, as throwing off the last remnant of
      his regal costume, he rushed out, banging the door passionately behind
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary sat down to compose her thoughts in quiet, for Mr. Crow had
      previously made his escape unobserved; and truly there was need of some
      repose for her agitated and wearied faculties. Her uncle's dependence upon
      her for everything, and her aunt's jealousy of the influence she had over
      him, placed her in a position of no common difficulty, and one of which
      every day seemed to increase the embarrassment. For a moment she thought
      she would have preferred a life of utter insignificance and obscurity; but
      as suddenly it occurred to her, "What had I been without these duties and
      these cares? For me there are few, if any, of the ties that bind other
      girls to their homes. I have neither mother nor sister; I have none of the
      resources which education suggests to others. My mind cannot soar above
      the realities that surround me, and seek for its enjoyments in the realms
      of fancy; but, perhaps, I can do better," said she, proudly, "and make of
      these same every-day materials the poetry of an actual existence." As she
      spoke, she threw open the window, and walked out upon the terrace over the
      sea. The fishermen's boats were all standing out from shore,&mdash;a tiny
      fleet, whose hardy crews had done no discredit to the proudest
      three-decker. Though the heavy gale of the morning had gone down, it still
      blew fresh, and a long rolling swell thundered along in-shore, and sent a
      deep booming noise through many a rocky cavern. High above this deafening
      clamor, however, rose the hearty cheers of the fishermen as they detected
      Mary's figure where she stood; and many a tattered rag of showy bunting
      was hoisted to do her honor. Never insensible to such demonstrations, Mary
      felt at the moment almost overpowered with emotion. But a moment back and
      she bewailed her isolation and friendlessness; and see, here were hundreds
      who would have resigned life in her behalf. Still, as the boats receded,
      the wind bore to her ears the welcome sounds; and as she heard them, her
      heart seemed to expand and swell with generous thoughts and good wishes,
      while along her cheeks heavy tears were rolling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What need have I of other friends than such as these?" cried she,
      passionately. "<i>They</i> understand me, and I them; and as for the great
      world, we are not made for each other!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My own sentiments to a 'T,' miss," said a soft, mincing voice behind her;
      and Mary turned and beheld Mr. Crow. He had arrayed himself in a small
      velvet skull-cap and a blouse, and stood mixing the colors on his palette
      in perfect composure. "I 'm afraid, Miss Martin, there 's an end of the
      great 'Historical.' Your uncle will scarcely be persuaded to put on the
      robes again, and it's a downright pity. I was getting a look of weariness&mdash;imbecility
      I might call it&mdash;into his features that would have crowned the work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think I ever knew what your subject was!" said she, half
      indolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Abdication of Charles V., Miss Martin," said he, proudly. "This is
      the fourteenth time I have depicted it; and never, I am bound to say, with
      more favorable 'studies.' Your uncle is fine; my Lady gorgeous; I don't
      say what I 'd like of another lovely and gifted individual; but even down
      to that old rogue of a butler that would insist on taking snuff through
      the bars of his helmet, they were all grand, miss,&mdash;positively
      grand!" Seeing that she appeared to bestow some attention to him, Mr. Crow
      went on: "You see, miss, in the beginning of a great effort of this kind
      there is no progress made at all. The sitters keep staring at one another,
      each amused at some apparent absurdity in costume or attitude; and then,
      if you ask them to call up a look of love, hate, jealousy, or the like,
      it's a grin you get,&mdash;a grin that would shame a hyena. By degrees,
      however, they grow used to the situation; they 'tone down,' as one might
      say, and learn to think less of themselves, and be more natural. It was
      sheer fatigue, downright exhaustion, and nothing else, was making your
      uncle so fine; and if he could have been kept on low diet,&mdash;I did n't
      like to mention it, though I often wished it,&mdash;I 'd have got a look
      of cadaverous madness into his face that would have astonished you."
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Mr. Crow had approached his canvas, and was working away
      vigorously, the action of his brush appearing to stimulate his loquacity.
      Mary drew near to observe him, and insensibly felt attracted by that
      fascination which the progress of a picture invariably possesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is the Queen," continued he; "she's crying,&mdash;as well she might;
      she doesn't rightly know whether the old fellow's out of his mind or not;
      she has her misgivings, and she does n't half like that old thief of a
      Jesuit that's whispering in the King's ear. This was to be you, Miss
      Martin; you were betrothed to one of the young princes; but somehow you
      weren't quite right in your head, and you are looking on rather more
      amused, you perceive, than in any way moved; you were holding up your
      beautiful petticoat, all covered with gold and precious stones, as much as
      to say, 'Ain't I fine this morning?' when you heard the herald's trumpet
      announce the Prince of Orange; and there he is,&mdash;or there he ought to
      be,&mdash;coming in at the door. There's a chap pulling the curtain aside;
      but I suppose, now," added he, with a sigh, "we 'll never see the Prince
      there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where could you have found a study for your Prince, Mr. Crow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have him here, miss," said Crow, laying down his brush to take a small
      sketch-book from the pocket of his blouse. "I have him here; and there
      wouldn't have been a finer head in the canvas,&mdash;pale, stern-looking,
      but gentle withal; a fellow that would say, 'Lead them to the scaffold,'
      as easy as winking, and that would tremble and falter under the eye of a
      woman he loved. There he is, now,&mdash;the hair, you know, I put in
      myself, and the bit of beard, just for a little Titian effect; but the
      eyes are his own, and the mouth not as good as his own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a striking head, indeed," said Mary, still contemplating it
      attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's exactly what it is; none of your common brain-boxes, but a grand
      specimen of the classic head, civilized down to a mediaeval period; the
      forty-first descendant of an Emperor or a Proconsul, living at the Pincian
      Hall, or at his villa on the Tiber, sitting for his likeness to Giordano."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a painful expression in the features, too," added she, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So there is; and I believe he 's in bad health."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" said Mary, starting. "I quite forgot there was an original all
      this time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's alive; and what's more, he's not a mile from where we 're standing."
      Mr. Crow looked cautiously about him as he spoke, ac if fearful of being
      overheard; and then approaching close to Miss Martin, and dropping his
      voice to a whisper, said, "I can venture to tell you what I dare n't tell
      my Lady; for I know well if she suspected who it was would be the Prince
      of Orange, begad, I might abdicate too, as well as the King. That young
      man there is-the son of a grocer in Oughterard,&mdash;true, every word of
      it,&mdash;Dan Nelligan's son! and you may fancy now what chance he 'd have
      of seeing himself on that canvas if her Ladyship knew it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this the youth who has so distinguished himself at college?" asked
      Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very one. I made that sketch of him when he was reading for the
      medal; he did n't know it, for I was in a window opposite, where he
      couldn't see me; and when I finished he leaned his chin in his hand and
      looked up at the sky, as if thinking; and the expression of his up-turned
      face, with the lips a little apart, was so fine that I took it down at
      once, and there it is," said he, turning over the page and presenting a
      few pencil lines lightly and spiritedly drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A young gentleman left this packet, Miss Mary, and said it was for you,"
      said a servant, presenting a small sealed enclosure. Mary Martin blushed
      deeply, and she opened the parcel, out of which fell her own glove, with a
      card.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very man we were talking of," said Mr. Crow, lifting it up and
      handing it to her,&mdash;"Joseph Nelligan. That's like the old proverb;
      talk of the&mdash;" But she was gone ere he could finish his quotation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There she goes," said Crow, sorrowfully; "and if she 'd have stayed ten
      minutes more I 'd have had her all complete!" and he contemplated with
      glowing satisfaction a hasty sketch he had just made in his book. "It's
      like her,&mdash;far more than anything I have done yet; but after all&mdash;"
      And he shook his head mournfully as he felt the poor pretension of his
      efforts. "Small blame to me to fail, anyhow," added he, after a pause. "It
      would take Titian himself to paint her; and even he couldn't give all the
      softness and delicacy of the expression,&mdash;that would take Raffaelle;
      and Vandyke for her eyes, when they flash out at times; and Giordano for
      the hair. Oh, if he could have seen it just as I did a minute ago, when
      the wind blew it back, and the sunlight fell over it! "Arrah!" cried he,
      impatiently, as with a passionate gesture he tore the leaf from his book
      and crushed it in his hand,&mdash;"arrah! What right have I even to
      attempt it?" And he sat down, covering his face with his hands, to muse
      and mourn in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simpson&mdash;or as he was more generally known, Simmy Crow&mdash;was
      neither a Michael Angelo nor a Raffaelle; but he was a simple-minded,
      honest-hearted creature, whose life had been a long hand-to-hand fight
      with fortune. Originally a drawing-master in some country academy, the
      caprice&mdash;for it was little else&mdash;of a whimsical old lady had
      sent him abroad to study; that is, sent him to contemplate the very
      highest triumphs of genius with a mind totally unprepared and
      uncultivated, to gaze on the grandest conceptions without the shadow of a
      clew to them, and to try and pick up the secrets of art when he stood in
      utter ignorance of its first principles. The consequence was, he went wild
      in the enthusiasm of his admiration; he became a passionate worshipper at
      the shrine, but never essayed to be priest at the altar. Disgusted and
      dispirited by his own miserable attempts, he scarcely ever touched a
      pencil, but roved from city to city, and from gallery to gallery,
      entranced,&mdash;enchanted by a fascination that gradually insinuated
      itself into his very being, and made up the whole aim and object of his
      thoughts. This idolatry imparted an ecstasy to his existence that lifted
      him above every accident of fortune. Poor, hungry, and ill-clad, he still
      could enter a gallery or a church, sit down before a Guido or a Rembrandt,
      and forget all, save the glorious creation before him. By the sudden death
      of his patroness, he was left, without a shilling, hundreds of miles from
      home. Humble as his requirements were, he could not supply them; he
      offered to teach, but it was in a land where all have access to the best
      models; he essayed to copy, but his efforts were unsalable. To return home
      to his country was now his great endeavor; and after innumerable
      calamities and reverses, he did arrive in England, whence he made his way
      to Ireland, poorer than he had quitted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he returned in better plight, had he come back with some of the
      appearance of success, the chances are that he might have thriven on the
      accidents of fame; but he was famishing and in beggary. Some alleged that
      he was a worthless fellow who had passed a life of idleness and debauch;
      others, that he was not without ability, but that his habits of
      dissipation rendered him hopeless; and a few&mdash;a very few&mdash;pitied
      him as a weak-brained enthusiast, who had no bad about him, but was born
      to failure!
    </p>
    <p>
      In his utter destitution he obtained work as a house-painter,&mdash;an
      employment which he followed for three or four yeare, and in which
      capacity he had been sent by his master to paint some ornamental
      stucco-work at Cro' Martin. The ability he displayed attracted Lady
      Dorothea's notice, and she engaged him to decorate a small garden villa
      with copies from her own designs. He was entirely successful, and so much
      pleased was her Ladyship that she withdrew him from his ignoble servitude
      and attached him to her own household, where now he had been living two
      years, the latter half of which period had been passed in the great work
      of which we have already made some mention. It so chanced that poor Simmy
      had never sold but two copies in his life: one was The Abdication of
      Charles V., the other, The Finding of Moses; and so, out of gratitude to
      these successes, he went on multiplying new versions of these subjects <i>ad
      infinitum</i>, eternally writing fresh variations on the old themes, till
      the King and the Lawgiver filled every avenue of his poor brain, and he
      ceased to have a belief that any other story than these could be the
      subject of high art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy as he now was, he never ceased to feel that his position exposed him
      to many an ungenerous suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They 'll say I 'm humbugging this old lady," was the constant
      self-reproach he kept repeating. "I know well what they 'll think of me; I
      think I hear the sneering remarks as I pass." And so powerfully had this
      impression caught hold of him, that he vowed, come what would of it, he 'd
      set out on his travels again, and face the cold stern world, rather than
      live on what seemed to be the life of a flatterer and a sycophant. He
      could not, however, endure the thought of leaving his "Abdication"
      unfinished, and he now only remained to complete this great work. "Then I
      'm off," said he; "and then they 'll see if poor Simmy Crow was the fellow
      they took him for." Better thoughts on this theme were now passing through
      his mind, from which at last he aroused himself to proceed with his
      picture. Once at work, his spirits rose; hopes flitted across his brain,
      and he was happy. His own creations seemed to smile benignly on him, too,
      and he felt towards them like a friend, and even talked with them, and
      confided his secret thoughts to them. In this pleasant mood we shall leave
      him, then; nor shall we linger to listen to the avowals he is making of
      his upright intentions, nor his willingness to bear the hardest rubs of
      fortune, so that none can reproach him for a mean subserviency.

      CHAPTER VI. A DASH OF POLITICS
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Well, what is it, Molly,&mdash;what is it all about?" said Martin, as
      Mary entered the library, where he was sitting with an unread newspaper
      stretched across his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a piece of news Scanlan has brought, uncle, and not of the most
      agreeable kind either."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'll not hear more of it," broke he in, pettishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you must, uncle, since without your own counsel and advice nothing
      can be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do nothing, then," added he, sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, I 'll not let you off thus easily," said she, passing an arm
      over his shoulder. "You know well I 'd not tease you if it could be
      avoided, but here is a case where I can be no guide. It is a question of
      the borough, Lord Kilmorris thinks himself strong enough to stand on his
      own merits, and repudiates your aid and his own principles together."
      Martin's attention being now secured, she went on: "He says&mdash;at least
      as well as I can follow his meaning&mdash;that with this new measure must
      come a total change of policy,&mdash;abrogating all old traditions and old
      notions; that <i>you</i>, of course, are little likely to adopt this
      opinion, at least at once, and so he releases you from all obligations to
      support him, and himself from all tie to represent <i>you</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is Lady Dorothy's doing," broke in Martin, passionately; "her
      confounded letter-writing has brought this upon us. I told her that those
      fellows were trimming; I warned her that they were only waiting for this
      Bill to pass, to turn round upon us as a barbarous old remnant of feudal
      oppression; but he dare n't do it, Molly,&mdash;Kilmorris has n't a leg to
      stand upon in the borough. He could n't count upon twenty&mdash;no, not
      ten votes, without me. It's a scurvy trick, too, and it sha'n't succeed,
      if I stand for the borough myself." And he blurted out the last words as
      though they were the expression of an enmity driven to its last resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, uncle," said she, caressingly; "after all you have yourself told
      me of a parliamentary life, that must never be. Its unending intrigues and
      petty plotting, its fatiguing days and harassing nights, its jealousies
      and disappointments, and defeats, all hard enough to be borne by those who
      must make a trade of their politics, but utterly insupportable to one who,
      like you, can enjoy his independence. Do not think of that, I beseech
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then am I to see this man carry my own town in my very teeth?" cried he,
      angrily. "Is that your advice to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You often spoke of Harry. Why not put him forward now he is coming home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, and the very first thing he'll do will be to resign the seat because
      he had not been consulted about the matter before the election. You know
      him well, Molly; and you know that he exchanged into a regiment in India
      simply because I had obtained his appointment to the Blues. His amiable
      mother's disposition is strong in him!" muttered he, half to himself, but
      loud enough to be heard by his niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events, see Scanlan," said she; "learn how the matter really
      stands; don't rely on my version of it, but see what Lord Kilmorris
      intends, and take your own measures calmly and dispassionately
      afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Scanlan engaged for him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think not. I suspect that negotiations are merely in progress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if he even was," broke in Martin, violently, "I have made the fellow
      what he is, and he should do as I ordered him. Let him come in, Molly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is not in the house, uncle; he went down to the village."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not here? Why didn't he wait? What impertinence is this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wished to bait his horses, and probably to get some breakfast for
      himself, which I had not the politeness to offer him here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His horses? His tandem, I'll be sworn," said Martin, with a sneer. "I 'll
      ask for no better evidence of what we are coming to than that Maurice
      Scanlan drives about the county with a tandem."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And handles them very neatly, too," said Mary, with a malicious sparkle
      of her eye, for she could n't refrain from the spiteful pleasure of seeing
      her uncle in a regular fury for a mere nothing. All the more salutary, as
      it withdrew his thoughts from weightier themes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure of it, Miss Martin. I'm certain that he is a most accomplished
      whip, and as such perfectly sure to find favor in <i>your</i> eyes. Let
      him come up here at once, however. Say I want him immediately," added he,
      sternly; and Mary despatched a servant with the message, and sat down in
      front of her uncle, neither uttering a word nor even looking towards the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all, Molly," said he, in the quiet, indolent tone so natural to him&mdash;"after
      all, what does it signify who's in or who's out? I don't care a brass
      farthing about party or party triumphs; and even if I did, I 'm not
      prepared&mdash;What are you laughing at,&mdash;what is it amuses you now?"
      asked he, half testily, while she laughed out in all the unrestrained flow
      of joyous mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been waiting for that confession this half-hour, uncle, and really
      I was beginning to be afraid of a disappointment. Why, dearest uncle, you
      were within a hair's breadth of forgetting your principles, and being
      actually caught, for once in your life, prepared and ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, is that it? Is it my embarrassment, then, that affords you so much
      amusement?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Far from it," said she, affectionately. "I was only laughing at that
      quiet little nook you retire to whenever you ought to be up and doing.
      Unprepared you say. Not a bit of it. Indisposed, indolent, unwilling,
      indifferent, any of these you like; but with a mind so full of its own
      good resources, and as ready to meet every contingency as any one's, don't
      say you are unprepared. Come, now, bear with me this once, dearest uncle,
      and don't be angry if I throw myself, like a rock or sandbank, betwixt you
      and your harbor of refuge. But I hear Mr. Scanlan's voice, and so I shall
      leave you. Be resolute, uncle, determined, and&mdash;'prepared'!" And with
      a gesture half menace and half drollery, she left the room as the attorney
      entered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scanlan, like most of those who came but casually in contact with Martin,
      had conceived a low idea of his capacity,&mdash;lower by far than it
      deserved, since behind his indolence there lay a fund of good
      common-sense,&mdash;a mine, it must be acknowledged, that he seldom cared
      to work. The crafty man of law had, however, only seen him in his ordinary
      moods of careless ease and idleness, and believed that pride of family,
      fortune, and position were the only ideas that found access to his mind,
      and that by a dexterous allusion to these topics it would always be an
      easy task to influence and direct him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's this my niece has been telling me of Lord Kilmorris?" said Martin,
      abruptly, and without even replying to the salutations of the other, who
      hovered around a chair in an uncertainty as to whether he might dare to
      seat himself uninvited,&mdash;"he's going to contest the borough with us,
      is n't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Scanlan leaned one arm on the back of the chair, and in a half-careless
      way replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is afraid that you and he don't quite agree, sir. He leans to measures
      that he suspects you may not altogether approve of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, none of this balderdash with me, Master Maurice. Has he
      bought the fellows already, or, rather, have you bought them? Out with it,
      man! What will he give? Name the sum, and let us treat the matter in a
      business-like way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Scanlan sat down and laughed heartily for some minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you know me well enough, Mr. Martin, by this time," said he, "to
      say whether I'ma likely man to meddle with such a transaction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very likeliest in Ireland; the man I 'd select amidst ten thousand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry to hear you say so, sir, that's all," said the other, with a
      half-offended air; "nor do I see that anything in my past life warrants
      the imputation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin turned fiercely round, about to make a reply which, if once
      uttered, would have ended all colloquy between them, when suddenly
      catching himself he said, "Have you taken any engagement with his
      Lordship?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not as yet, sir,&mdash;not formally, at least. My Lord has written me a
      very full statement of his ideas on politics, what he means to do, and so
      forth, and he seems to think that anything short of a very liberal line
      would not give satisfaction to the electors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who told him so? Who said that the borough was not perfectly content with
      the representative that&mdash;that"&mdash;he stammered and faltered&mdash;"that
      its best friends had fixed upon to defend its interests? Who said that a
      member of my own family might not desire the seat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This announcement, uttered with a tone very much akin to menace, failed to
      produce either the astonishment or terror that Martin looked for, and
      actually supposing that the expression had not been heard, he repeated it.
      "I say, sir, has any one declared that a Martin will not stand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not aware of it," said Scanlan, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir," cried Martin, as if unable to delineate the consequences, and
      wished to throw the weight of the duty on his opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There would be a warm contest, no doubt, sir," said Scanlan, guardedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir; nor the shadow of a contest," rejoined Martin, angrily. "You'll
      not tell <i>me</i> that my own town&mdash;the property that has been in my
      family for seven centuries and more&mdash;would presume&mdash;that is,
      would desire&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;break the ties that have bound us to
      each other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I could tell you my mind, Mr. Martin, without offending you; that
      is, I wish you 'd let me just say what my own opinion is, and take it for
      what it is worth, and in five minutes you 'd be in a better position to
      make up your mind about this matter than if we went on discussing it for a
      week." There was a dash of independence in his utterance of these words
      that actually startled Martin; for, somehow, Scanlan had himself been
      surprised into earnestness by meeting with an energy on the other's part
      that he had never suspected; and thus each appeared in a new light to the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I speak out? Well, then, here is what I have to say: the Relief Bill
      is passed, the Catholics are now emancipated&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and be&mdash;" Martin caught himself with a cough, and the other
      went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, if they don't send one of their own set into Parliament at
      once, it is because they 'd like to affect, for a little while at least, a
      kind of confidence in the men who gave them their liberties. O'Connell
      himself gave a pledge, that of two candidates, equal in all other
      respects, they'd select the Protestant; and so they would for a time. And
      it lies with you, and other men of your station, to determine how long
      that interval is to last; for an interval it will only be, after all. If
      you want to pursue the old system of 'keeping down,' you 'll drive them at
      once into the hands of the extreme Papist party, who, thanks to
      yourselves, can now sit in Parliament; but if you 'll moderate your views,
      take a humbler standard of your own power,&mdash;conciliate a prejudice
      here, obliterate an old animosity there&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In fact," broke in Martin, "swear by this new creed that Lord Kilmorris
      has sent you a sketch of in his letter! Then I 'll tell you what, sir&mdash;I
      'd send the borough and all in it to the&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you might, Mr. Martin, and you 'd never mend matters in the least,"
      broke he in, with great coolness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was now a dead silence for several minutes; at last Martin spoke,
      and it was in a tone and with a manner that indicated deep reflection:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I often said to those who would emancipate the Catholics, 'Are you
      prepared to change places with them? You have been in the ascendant a good
      many years, are you anxious now to try what the other side of the medal
      looks like? for, if not, leave them as they are.' Well, they did n't
      believe me; and maybe now my prophecy is nigh its accomplishment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very likely you were right, sir; but whether or not, it's the law
      now, and let us make the best of it," said Scanlan, who had a practical
      man's aversion to all that savored of mere speculative reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As how, for instance&mdash;in what way, Mr. Scanlan?" asked Martin,
      curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you 'll not support Lord Kilmorris&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I won't, I promise you; put that clean out of your head to begin
      with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, there is but one other course open. Come to some compromise
      with the Romanist party; if you don't like to give them a stray vote&mdash;and
      mark me, they 'd make better terms with <i>you</i> than with a stranger&mdash;but
      if you don't like that, why, take the representation alternately with
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin rose from his chair and advanced close to where Scanlan was
      sitting, then, fixing his eyes steadfastly on him, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who commissioned you to make this proposition to <i>me?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one, upon my oath. There is not a man breathing who has ever so much
      as hinted at what I have just said to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad of it; I'm heartily glad of it," said Martin, calmly reseating
      himself. "I'm glad there is not another fellow in this county your equal
      in impudence! Aye, Mr. Scanlan, you heard me quite correctly. I saw many a
      change going on amongst us, and I foresaw many more; but that a Martin of
      Cro' Martin should be taught his political duty by Maurice Scanlan, and
      that that duty consisted in a beggarly alliance with the riff-raff of a
      county town,&mdash;that was, indeed, a surprise for which I was in no wise
      prepared."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir, I 'm sorry if I have given any offence," said Scanlan, rising,
      and, in a voice of the most quiet intonation, making his excuses. "Your
      rejection of the counsel I was bold enough to suggest leaves me, at least,
      at liberty to offer my services where they will not be rejected so
      contumeliously."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this a threat, Mr. Scanlan?" said Martin, with a supercilious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, nothing of the kind. I know too well what becomes <i>my</i>
      station, and is <i>due to yours</i>, to forget myself so far; but as you
      don't set any value on the borough yourself, and as there may be others
      who do&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay and eat your dinner here, Scanlan," said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I promised Mrs. Cronan, sir&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send an apology to her; say it was <i>my</i> fault,&mdash;that I detained
      you." And without waiting for a reply, Martin sauntered from the room,
      leaving the attorney alone with his reflections.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. A COLLEGE COMPETITOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Young Nelligan had distanced all his competitors in his college career;
      some who were his equals in ability, were inferior to him in habits of
      hard and patient labor; and others, again, were faint-hearted to oppose
      one in whose success they affected to believe luck had no small share. One
      alone had the honest candor to avow that he deserved his pre-eminence, on
      the true ground of his being their superior. This was a certain Jack
      Massingbred, a young fellow of good family and fortune, and who, having
      been rusticated at Oxford, and involved in some outrage against authority
      in Cambridge, had come over to finish his college career in the "Silent
      Sister."
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Irish by birth, and connected with Ireland by ties of family and
      fortune, he had passed all his life in England, his father having repaired
      to that country after the Union, exchanging the barren honor of a seat for
      an Irish borough for a snug Treasury appointment. His son had very early
      given proof of superior capacity. At Rugby he was distinguished as a
      scholar; and in his opening life at Oxford his talents won high praise for
      him. Soon after his entrance, however, he had fallen into a fast set,&mdash;of
      hunting, tandem-driving, and occasionally hard-drinking men,&mdash;in
      whose society he learned to forget all his aim for college success, and to
      be far more anxious for distinction as a whip or a stroke-oar than for all
      the honors of scholarship. At first he experienced a sense of pride in the
      thought that he could hold his own with either set, and take the lead in
      the examination-hall as easily as he assumed the first place in the social
      meeting. A few reverses, however, taught him that his theory was a
      mistake, that no amount of ability will compensate for habits of idleness
      and dissipation, and that the discursive efforts of even high genius will
      be ever beaten by the steady results of patient industry. Partly
      indifferent to what had once been his great ambition, partly offended by
      his failures, Massingbred threw himself entirely into the circle of his
      dissipated companions, and became the very head and front of all their
      wildest excesses. An absurd exploit, far more ludicrous than really
      culpable, procured his rustication; a not less ridiculous adventure drove
      him from Cambridge; and he had at last arrived in Dublin, somewhat tamed
      down by his experiences, and half inclined to resume his long-abandoned
      desire for college distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The habits of the Irish College were strikingly unlike those of either
      Oxford or Cambridge. Instead of a large class consisting of men of great
      fortune and high expectations, he found a very slight sprinkling of such,
      and even they made up nothing that resembled a party. Separated by age,
      political distinctions, and county associations, all stronger in the
      poorer country than in the richer one, they held little intercourse
      together, and were scarcely acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there was less actual wealth, there was also less credit to be obtained
      by an Irish student. The Dublin shopkeeper acknowledged no prestige in the
      "gownsman;" he admitted him to no special privilege of book-debts; and as
      the great majority of the students resided with their families in the
      capital, there was no room for that reckless extravagance so often
      prosecuted by those who are temporarily removed from domestic supervision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massingbred was at first grievously disappointed. There were neither great
      names nor great fortunes amongst his new associates. Their mode of life,
      too, struck him as mean and contemptible. There were clever men reading
      for honors, and stupid men steering their slow way to a degree; but where
      were the fast ones? where the fellows who could tool a team or steer a
      six-oar, who could dash up to town for a week's reckless life at Crocky's
      and Tattersall's, make their book on the Oaks, or perhaps ride the winner
      at a steeplechase?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all grievously slow. Dublin itself was a poor affair. He had few
      acquaintances, the theatres were bad, and public amusements there were
      none. His fellow-students, too, stood aloof from him. It was not that he
      was richer, better dressed, rode blood horses, dined at Morris-son's, wore
      kid gloves, and carried scented pocket-handkerchiefs. It was not that he
      had a certain air of puppyism as he wended his way across the courts, or
      sauntered elegantly into chapel. They could have forgiven any or all of
      these better than one of his offendings, which was his accent. Strange as
      it may seem, his English voice and English pronunciation were the most
      unpopular things about him, and many a real defect in his character might
      have met a more merciful construction had he given no initial "H" to
      "humble," and evinced a more generous confusion about his "wills" and
      "snails."
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat bored by a life so unlike anything he had ever tried before,&mdash;partly,
      perhaps, stimulated to show that he could do something beside canter his
      thorough-bred along Sackville Street, or lounge in the stage-box in
      solitary splendor,&mdash;he went in for honors, and, to the surprise of
      all, succeeded. In fact, he beat two or three of the distinguished men of
      his time, till, thrown by the chance of events into Nelligan's division,
      he found at once his superior, and saw that he was in presence of an
      intelligence considerably above his own. When he had adventured on the
      struggle and found himself worsted, he acknowledged defeat with all the
      generosity of an honorable nature; and forcing his way through the crowd
      as it issued from the examination-hall, was the very first to grasp
      Nelligan's hand and congratulate him on his success.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was all got up; he was bursting with jealousy. The fellow could have
      strangled Nelligan," muttered one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He certainly put a good face on the disaster," said another, more
      mercifully given; "though I suppose he feels the thing sorely enough at
      heart!"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was exactly what he did not, however. Young Massingbred regarded a
      college distinction as no evidence whatever of a man's attainments. He had
      seen stupid fellows win the prize for which clever ones strove in vain;
      but, at all events, he regarded such successes as contributing in nothing
      to the great race of life, and had even a theory that such early efforts
      were often the very means of exhausting the energies that should be
      exerted for the high rewards of the world. Besides this, he felt a
      pleasure in manfully showing that he was above a petty jealousy, and
      fairly owning himself beaten in a fair struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are the better man, Nelligan," said he, gayly; "I 'll not try another
      fall with you, be assured."
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange was it that in this very avowal he had asserted what the other
      felt in his inmost heart to be an immeasurable superiority over him; and
      that in the very moment of striking his flag he had proclaimed his
      victory. To be able to run him so hard for the race and yet not feel the
      struggle, to strive for the prize and care nothing for defeat, seemed to
      Nelligan the evidence of an ambition that soared above college triumph,
      and he could not but envy that buoyant high-hearted temperament that
      seemed to make light of difficulties and not even feel depressed by a
      defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to this time these two young men had scarcely known each other, but now
      they became intimate. The very difference in character served to draw them
      more closely together; and if Nelligan felt a degree of admiration for
      qualities whose brilliant display opened a new sense of enjoyment to him,
      the other was delighted with the gentle and almost childlike innocence of
      the student whose far-soaring intellect was mastering the highest
      questions of science.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massingbred was one of those natures in whom frankness is an instinct. It
      seems to such a relief to open the secrets of the heart and avow their
      weaknesses and their shortcomings, as though&mdash;by some Moral Popery&mdash;they
      would obtain the benefit of a free confession and go forth the better for
      their candor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only did he tell Nelligan of his own career and its accidents, the
      causes for which he was not on good terms with his family, and so on; but
      he even ventured to discuss the public life of his father, and, in a
      spirit of banter, swore that to his political subserviency did he owe his
      whole fortune in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father was one of the crew when the vessel was wrecked, Nelligan,"
      said he; "there was plenty of talk of standing by the ship to the last,
      and perishing with her. Some did so, and they are forgotten already. My
      father, however, jumped into the long-boat with a few more, and thought
      that probably they might find another craft more seaworthy; fortunately he
      was right; at least, assuredly, I 'm not the man to say he was not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But was there no desertion of principle, Massingbred?" said Nelligan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more than there is a desertion of your old coat when you discover it
      to be too threadbare to wear any longer. Irish Politics, as the men of
      that day understood them, had become impracticable,&mdash;impossible, I
      might say; the only sensible thing to do was to acknowledge the fact. My
      father was keen-sighted enough to see it in that light, and here 's his
      health for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nelligan was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, Joe, out with it. Your family were honest Unionists. Tell me so
      frankly, man. Own to me that you and yours look upon us all as a set of
      knaves and scoundrels, that sold their country, and so forth. I want to
      see you in a mood of good passionate indignation for once. Out with it,
      boy; curse us to your heart's content, and I 'll hear it like an angel,
      for the simple reason that I know it to be just. You won't, won't you? Is
      your anger too deep for words? or are there any special and peculiar
      wrongs that make your dark consuming wrath too hot for utterance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nelligan was still silent; but the blush which now covered his face had
      become almost purple. The allusion to his family as persons of political
      importance struck him, and for the first time, with a sense of shame. What
      would Massingbred think of them if he knew their real station? what would
      he think of <i>him</i> for having concealed it? Had he concealed it? Had
      he ever divulged the truth? He knew not; in the whirlwind of his confusion
      he knew nothing. He tried to say some words to break the oppressive
      silence that seemed to weigh him down like an accusation, but he could
      not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see it all, Nelligan. My foolish affectation of laughing at all
      principle has disgusted you; but the truth is, I don't feel it: I do not.
      I own frankly that the bought patriot is a ruined man, and there is a
      moral Nemesis over every fellow that sells himself; I don't mean to say
      but that many who did so did n't make the best bargain their brains were
      worth, and my father for one; he was a man of fair average abilities,&mdash;able
      to say his commonplaces like his neighbors,&mdash;and naturally felt that
      they would sound as well in England as in Ireland; I don't think he had a
      single conviction on any subject, so that he really sold a very unsalable
      article when he vended himself. But there were others,&mdash;your
      Governor, for instance; come, now, tell me about him; you are so devilish
      close, and I want to hear all about your family. You won't; well, I'll
      give you one chance more, and then&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What then?" asked Nelligan, breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll just go and learn for myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How? what do you mean?" "The easiest way in the world. The vacation
      begins next Tuesday, and I 'll just invite myself to spend the first week
      of it under your paternal roof. You look terribly shocked, absolutely
      horrified; well, so you ought. It is about the greatest piece of
      impertinence I 've heard of. I assure you I have a full consciousness of
      that myself; but no matter, I 'll do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nelligan's shame was now an agony. It had never occurred to him in his
      life to feel ashamed of his station or that of his family, for the simple
      reason that he had never made pretension to anything higher or more
      exalted. The distinctions at which he aimed were those attainable by
      ability; social successes were triumphs he never dreamed of. But now came
      the thought of how he should stand in his friend's esteem, when the fact
      was revealed that he was the son of very humble parents, all whose ways,
      thoughts, and habits would be apt themes for ridicule and sarcasm. Over
      and over again had Massingbred annoyed him by the disparaging tone in
      which he canvassed "small people," the sneering depreciation in which he
      held all their doings, and the wholesale injustice by which he classed
      their sentiments with their good manners. It was the one feature of his
      friend's character that gave a check to his unbounded esteem for him. Had
      he not possessed this blemish, Nelligan would have deemed him nearly
      faultless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intensely feeling this, Nelligan would have given much for courage to say,
      "I am one of that very set you sneer at. All my associations and ties are
      with them. My home is amongst them, and every link of kindred binds me to
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, somehow, he could not bring himself to the effort. It was not that he
      dreaded the loss of friendship that might ensue,&mdash;indeed, he rather
      believed that such would not occur; but he thought that a time might come
      when that avowal might be made with pride, and not in humiliation, when he
      should say: "My father, the little shopkeeper of Oughterard, gave me the
      advantages by which I became what I am. The class you sneer at had yet
      ambitions high and daring as your own; and talents to attain them, too!
      The age of noble and serf has passed away, and we live in a freer and more
      generous era, when men are tested by their own worth; and if birth and
      blood would retain their respect amongst us, it is by contesting with us
      more humbly born the prizes of life." To have asserted these things now,
      however, when he was nothing, when his name had no echo beyond the walls
      of a college, would have seemed to him an intolerable piece of
      presumption, and he was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massingbred read his reserve as proceeding from displeasure, and jestingly
      said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mustn't be angry with me, Joe. The boldness of men like me is less
      impudence than you take it for, since&mdash;should I fulfil my threat, and
      pay your father a visit&mdash;I 'd neither show surprise nor shame if he
      refused to receive me. I throw over all the claims of ceremony; but at the
      same time I don't want to impose the trammels on my friends. They are free
      to deal with me as frankly, ay, and as curtly as I have treated them; but
      enough of all this. Let us talk of something else."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they did, too,&mdash;of their college life and its changeful
      fortunes; of their companions and their several characters, and of the
      future itself, of which Massingbred pretended to read the fate, saying:
      "You'll be something wonderful one of these days, Joe. I have it as though
      revealed to me,&mdash;<i>you</i> astonishing the world by your abilities,
      and winning your way to rank and eminence; while <i>I</i> like a sign-post
      that points to the direction, shall stand stock-still, and never budge an
      inch, knowing the road, but not travelling it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why should it be so, Mass, when you have such a perfect consciousness
      of your powers for success?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the simple reason, my boy, that I know and feel how the cleverness
      which imposes upon others has never imposed upon myself. The popular error
      of a man's being able to do fifty things which he has not done from
      idleness, apathy, carelessness, and so on, never yet deceived me, because
      I know well that when a fellow has great stuff in him it will come out,
      whether he likes or not. You might as well say that the grapes in a
      wine-vat could arrest their own process of fermentation, as that a man of
      real genius&mdash;and mind, I am now speaking of no other&mdash;could
      suppress the working of his intelligence, and throw his faculties into
      torpor. The men who do nothing are exactly the men who can do no better.
      Volition, energy, the strong impulse for action, are part and parcel of
      every really great intellect; and your 'mute, inglorious Milton' only
      reminds me of the artist who painted his canvas all red to represent the
      passage of the Egyptians through the Red Sea. Believe me, you must take
      all untried genius in the same scale of credit as that by which you have
      fancied the chariots and horsemen submerged in the flood. They are there,
      if you like; and if you don't&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your theory requires that all men's advantages should be equal, their
      station alike, and their obstacles the same. Now, they are not so. See,
      for instance, in our University here. <i>I</i> am debarred from the
      fellowship-bench&mdash;or, at least, from attempting to reach it&mdash;because
      I am a Papist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then turn Protestant; or if that doesn't suit you, address yourself to
      kick down the barrier that stands in your way. By the bye, I did n't know
      you were a Roman; how comes that? Is it a family creed, or was it a
      caprice of your own?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the religion my family have always professed," said Nelligan,
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no right to speak of these subjects, because I have never felt
      strongly enough on them to establish strong convictions; but it appears to
      me that if I were you&mdash;that is, if I had <i>your</i> head on my
      shoulders&mdash;I should think twice ere I 'd sacrifice my whole future
      out of respect for certain dogmas that no more interfere with one's daily
      life and opinions than some obsolete usage of ancient Greece has a bearing
      upon a modern suit in Chancery. There, don't look fretful and impatient; I
      don't want to provoke you, nor is it worth your while to bring your siege
      artillery against my card-house. I appreciate everything you could
      possibly adduce by anticipation, and I yield myself as vanquished."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, half in earnest, half jestingly, Massingbred talked away, little
      thinking how deeply many a random speech entered into his friend's heart,
      taking firm root there to grow and vegetate hereafter. As for himself, it
      would have been somewhat difficult to say how far his convictions ever
      went with his words. Any attempt to guide and direct him was, at any time,
      enough to excite a wilful endeavor to oppose it, and whatever savored of
      opposition immediately evoked his resistance. The spirit of rebellion was
      the keynote of his character; he could be made anything, everything, or
      nothing, as authority&mdash;or as he would have styled it, tyranny&mdash;decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just at this very moment that an incident occurred to display this
      habit of his mind in its full force. His father, by employing much private
      influence and the aid of powerful friends, had succeeded in obtaining for
      him the promise of a most lucrative civil appointment in India. It was one
      of those situations which in a few years of very moderate labor secure an
      ample fortune for the possessor. Mr. Massingbred had forgotten but one
      thing in all the arrangement of this affair, which was to apprise his son
      of it beforehand, and make him, as it were, a part of the plot. That one
      omission, however, was enough to secure its failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack received the first tidings of the scheme when it was a fact, not a
      speculation. It was a thing done, not to do, and consequently a "gross
      piece of domestic cruelty to dispose of him and his future by an arbitrary
      banishment to a distant land, linking him with distasteful duties,
      uncongenial associates," and the rest of it. In a word, it was a case for
      resistance, and he did resist, and in no very measured fashion, either. He
      wrote back a pettish and ill-tempered refusal of the place, sneered at the
      class by whom such appointments were regarded as prizes, and coolly said
      that "it was quite time enough to attach himself to the serious business
      of life when he had tasted something of the pleasures that suited his time
      of life; besides," added he, "I must see which way my ambitions point;
      perhaps to a seat on the Treasury benches, perhaps to a bullock-team, a
      wood-axe, and a rifle in a new settlement. Of my resolves on either head,
      or on anything between them, you shall have the earliest possible
      intimation from your devoted, but perhaps not very obedient, to command,
    </p>
    <p>
      "J. M."
    </p>
    <p>
      His father rejoined angrily and peremptorily. The place had cost him
      everything he could employ or enlist of friendly patronage; he made the
      request assume all the weight of a deep personal obligation, and now the
      solicitation and the success were all to go for nothing. What if he should
      leave so very gifted a young gentleman to the unfettered use of his great
      abilities? What if he abstained from any interference with one so
      competent to guide himself? He threw out these suggestions too palpably to
      occasion any misconception, and Jack read them aright. "I'm quite ready
      for sea whenever you are pleased to cut the painter," said he; and the
      correspondence concluded with a dry intimation that two hundred a year,
      less than one half of his former allowance, should be paid into Coutts's
      for his benefit, but that no expenditure above that sum would be repaid by
      his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll emigrate; I 'll agitate; I 'll turn author, and write for the
      reviews; I 'll correspond with the newspapers; I 'll travel in Afrifca; I
      'll go to sea,&mdash;be a pirate;" in fact, there was nothing for which he
      thought his capacity unequal, nor anything against which his principles
      would revolt. In speculation, only, however; for in sober reality he
      settled down into a mere idler, discontented, dreamy, and unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little momentary bursts of energy would drive him now and then to his
      books, and for a week or two he would work really hard; when a change as
      sudden would come over him, and he would relapse into his former apathy.
      Thus was it that he had lived for some time after the term had come to an
      end, and scarcely a single student lingered within the silent courts.
      Perhaps the very solitude was the great charm of the place; there was that
      in his lonely, unfriended, uncompanionable existence that seemed to feed
      the brooding melancholy in which he indulged with all the ardor of a vice.
      He liked to think himself an outcast and forgotten. It was a species of
      flattery that he addressed to his own heart when he affected to need
      neither sympathy nor affection. Still his was not the stuff of which
      misanthropy is fashioned, and he felt acutely the silence of his friend
      Nelligan, who had never once written to him since they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'd scarcely have left <i>him</i> here," said he to himself one day;
      "had <i>he</i> been in my position, I 'd hardly have quitted <i>him</i>
      under such circumstances. He knew all about my quarrel with my father. He
      had read our letters on each side. To be sure he had condemned <i>me</i>,
      and taken the side against me; still, when there was a breach, and that
      breach offered no prospect of reconciliation, it was but scant friendship
      to say good-bye, and desert me. He might, at least, have asked me down to
      his house. I 'd not have gone; that 's certain. I feel myself very poor
      company for myself, and I 'd not inflict my stupidity upon others. Still,
      <i>he</i> might have thought it kind or generous. In fact, in such a case
      I would have taken no refusal; I'd have insisted."
    </p>
    <p>
      What a dangerous hypothesis it is when we assume to act for another; how
      magnanimously do we rise above all meaner motives, and only think of what
      is generous and noble; how completely we discard every possible
      contingency that could sway us from the road of duty, and neither look
      right nor left on our way to some high object! Jack Massingbred, arguing
      thus, ended by thinking himself a very fine fellow and his friend a very
      shabby one,&mdash;two conclusions that, strangely enough, did not put him
      into half as much good-humor with the world as he expected. At all events,
      he felt very sore with Nelligan, and had he known where to address him,
      would have written a very angry epistle of mock gratitude for all his
      solicitude in his behalf; very unfortunately, however, he did not know in
      what part of Ireland the other resided, nor did his acquaintance with
      provincial dialect enable him to connect his friend with a western county.
      He had so confidently expected to hear from him, that he had never asked a
      question as to his whereabouts. Thus was it with Massingbred, as he
      sauntered along the silent alleys of the College Park, in which, at rare
      intervals, some solitary sizar might be met with,&mdash;spare, sad-looking
      figures,&mdash;in whose features might be read the painful conflict of
      narrow fortune and high ambition. Book in hand generally, they rarely
      exchanged a look as he passed them; and Massingbred scanned at his ease
      these wasted and careworn sons of labor, wondering within himself was
      "theirs the right road to fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      Partly to shake off the depression that was over him by change of place,
      and in part to see something of the country itself, Massingbred resolved
      to make a walking-tour through the south and west of Ireland, and with a
      knapsack on his back, he started one fine autumn morning for Wicklow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. SOME KNOTTY POINTS THAT PUZZLED JOE NELLIGAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      This true history contains no record of the evening Mr. Scanlan passed at
      the Osprey's Nest; nor is it probable that in any diary kept by that
      intelligent individual there will yet be found materials to supply this
      historical void. Whether, therefore, high events and their consequences
      were discussed, or that the meeting was only devoted to themes of lighter
      importance, is likely to remain a secret to all time. That matters beneath
      the range of politics occupied the consideration of the parties was,
      however, evident from the following few lines of a note received by young
      Nelligan the next morning:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Dear Joe,&mdash;I dined yesterday at the 'Nest,' and we talked
     much of you. What would you think of paying a visit there
     this morning to see the picture, or anything else you can
     think of? I 've a notion it would be well taken. At all
     events, come over and speak to me here.

     "Ever yours,

     "M. SCANLAN."
</pre>
    <p>
      "I scarcely understand your note, Maurice," said young Nelligan, as he
      entered the little room where the other sat at breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you breakfasted?" said Scanlan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, an hour ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you taste that salmon? Well, then, just try Poll Hanigan's attempt
      at a grouse-pie; let me tell you, there is genius in the very ambition;
      she got the receipt from the cook at Cro' Martin, and the imitation is
      highly creditable. You 're wrong to decline it." And he helped himself
      amply as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But this note?" broke in the other, half impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;ay&mdash;the note; I 'm sure I forget what I wrote; what was it
      about? Yes, to be sure, I remember now. I want you to make yourself known,
      up there. It is downright folly, if not worse, to be keeping up these
      feuds and differences in Ireland any longer; such a course might suit the
      small politicians of Oughterard, but you and I know better, and Martin
      himself knows better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I never took any part in the conflict you speak of; I lived out of
      it,&mdash;away from it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And are therefore, exactly suited to repair a breach to which you never
      contributed. I assure you, my boy, the gentry&mdash;and I know them well&mdash;will
      meet you more than half-way. There is not a prouder fellow living than
      Martin there; he has throughout his whole life held his head higher than
      any man in our county, and yet he is quite ready to make advances towards
      you. Of course, what I say is strictly between ourselves; but my opinion
      is, that, if you like it, you may be as intimate up there as ever you were
      at old Hayes's, at the Priory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, what would you have me do?" asked Nelligan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just pay a visit there this morning; say that you are curious to see that
      great picture,&mdash;and it is a wonderful thing, if only for the size of
      it; or that you 'd like to have a look at Arran Island out of the big
      telescope at the top of the house; anything will serve as a reason, and
      then,&mdash;why, leave the rest to chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But really, Maurice, I see no sufficient cause for all this," said the
      youth, timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look now, Joe," said the other, drawing his chair closer to him, and
      talking in the low and measured tone of a confidence,&mdash;"look now,
      you're not going to pass your life as the successor to that excellent man,
      Dan Nelligan, of Oughterard, selling hides and ropes and ten-penny-nails,
      and making an estate the way old ladies make a patchwork quilt. You'll be
      able to start in life with plenty of tin and plenty of talent; you'll have
      every advantage that money and education can give, and only one drawback
      on your road to success,&mdash;the mere want of blood,&mdash;that dash of
      birth which forms the only real freemasonry in this world. Now mind me,
      Joe; the next best thing to having this oneself is to live and associate
      with those who have; for in time, what with catching up their prejudices
      and learning their ways, you come to feel very much as they do; and, what
      is better still, they begin to regard you as one of themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if I do not ambition this,&mdash;if I even reject it?" said the
      other, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then all I say is that Trinity College may make wonderful scholars, but
      turns out mighty weak men of the world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps so!" said Nelligan, dryly, and with a half-nettled air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you fancy there would be something like slavery in such a
      position?" said Scanlan, with a derisive look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it!" responded the other, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what do you say to the alternative,&mdash;and there is but one only
      open to you,&mdash;what do you think of spending your life as a follower
      of Daniel O'Connell; of being reminded every day and every hour that you
      have not a privilege nor a place that he did n't win for you; that he
      opened Parliament to you, and made you free of every guild where men of
      ability rise to honor? Ay, Joe! and what 's a thousand times worse,&mdash;knowing
      it all to be true, my boy! Take service with him once, and if you leave
      him you 're a renegade; remember that, and bethink you that there's no
      saying what crotchet he may have in store for future agitation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I never purposed any such part for myself," broke in Nelligan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind, it will fall to your lot for all that, if you don't quickly
      decide against it. What's Simmy Crow staring at? Look at him down there,
      he's counting every window in the street like a tax-gatherer." And he
      pointed to the artist, who, shading his eyes with one hand, stood peering
      at every house along the little street. "What's the matter, Simmy?" cried
      he, opening the casement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a house I'm looking for, down here, and I forget which it is; bother
      them, they 're all so like at this time of the year when they 're empty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you in search of a lodging, Simmy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it is n't that!" said the other, curtly, and still intent on his
      pursuit. "Bad luck to the architect that would n't vary what they call the
      'façade,' and give one some chance of finding the place again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is it you want, man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix, and I don't even know that same!" replied the artist; "but"&mdash;and
      he lowered his voice to a whisper as he spoke&mdash;"he's an elegant
      study,&mdash; as fine a head and face and as beautiful a beard as ever you
      saw. I met him at Kyle's Wood a week ago, begging; and what with his fine
      forehead and deep-set blue eyes, his long white hair, and his great shaggy
      eyebrows, I said to myself: 'Belisarius,' says I, 'by all that's grand,&mdash;a
      Moses, a Marino Faliero, or a monk in a back parlor discoursing to an old
      skull and a vellum folio,&mdash;any one of these,' says I, 'not to speak
      of misers, money-lenders, or magicians, as well;' and so I coaxed him down
      here on Saturday last, and put him somewhere to sleep, with a good supper
      and a pint of spirits, and may I never, if I know where I left him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three days ago?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so; and worse than all, I shut up the place quite dark, and only
      made a hole in the roof, just to let a fine Rembrandt light fall down on
      his head. Oh, then, it's no laughing matter, Maurice! Sure if anything
      happened to him&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your life wouldn't be worth sixpence before any jury in the county."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begad! it's what I was thinking; if they wouldn't take it as a practical
      joke."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're looking for ould Brennan!" cried a weather-beaten hag; "but he's
      gone to Oughterard for a summons. You'll pay dear for your tricks this
      time, anyhow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come up here, Simmy, and never mind her," said Scanlan; then, turning to
      Nelligan, he added, "There's not such a character in the county!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want my friend, Mr. Nelligan, here&mdash;Mr. Nelligan&mdash;Mr. Crow&mdash;I
      want him, I say, to come up and have a look at the great 'Historical '&mdash;eh,
      Simmy!&mdash;would n't it astonish him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you a votary of art, sir?" asked Crow, modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 've never seen what could be called a picture, except those portraits
      in the College Examination Hall might be deemed such."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, and they're not worthy the name, sir. Flood, mayhap, is like, but
      he's hard and stiff, and out of drawing; and Lord Clare is worse. It's in
      the Low Countries you 'd see portraits, real portraits! men that look down
      on you out of the canvas, as if <i>you</i> were the intruder there, and
      that <i>they</i> were waiting to know what brought you. A sturdy old
      Burgomaster, for instance, with a red-brown beard and a fierce pair of
      eyes, standing up firm as a rock on a pair of legs that made many a
      drawbridge tremble as he walked home to dinner on the Grand Canal, at
      Rotterdam, after finishing some mighty bargain for half a spice island, or
      paying a million of guilders down as a dowry for that flaxen-haired, buxom
      damsel in the next frame. Look at the dimples in her neck, and mark the
      folds in her satin. Is n't she comely, and calm, and haughty, and
      house-wifery, all together? Mind her foot, it isn't small, but see the
      shape of it, and the way it presses the ground&mdash;ay, just so&mdash;my
      service to you; but you are one there 's no joking with, even if one was
      alone with you." And he doffed his hat, and bowed obsequiously as he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're an enthusiast for your art?" said Nelligan, interested by the
      unmistakable sincerity of his zeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am, sir," was the brief reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the painter's is certainly a glorious career."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If for nothing else," burst in Crow, eagerly, "that it can make of one
      like me&mdash;poor, ignorant, and feeble, as I am&mdash;a fellow-soldier
      in the same army with Van Dyke and Titian and Velasquez&mdash;to know that
      in something that they thought, or hoped, or dared, or tried to do, I too
      have my share! You think me presumptuous to say this; you are sneering at
      such a creature as Simmy Crow for the impudence of such a boast, but it's
      in humility I say it, ay, in downright abject humility; for I 'd rather
      have swept out Rembrandt's room, and settled his rough boards on Cuyp's
      easel, than I 'd be a&mdash;a&mdash;battle-axe guard, or a
      lord-in-waiting, or anything else you like, that's great and grand at
      court."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I envy you a pursuit whose reward is in the practice rather than in the
      promise," said Nelligan, thoughtfully. "Men like myself labor that they
      may reach some far-away land of rewards and successes, and bear the
      present that they may enjoy the future."

      "Ay, but it will repay you well, by all accounts," said Crow. "Miss Mary
      told us last night how you had beat every one out of the field, and had
      n't left a single prize behind you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who said this?" cried Joe, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Mary,&mdash;Miss Martin. She said it was a credit to us all of the
      west, here, that there was one, at least, from Galway, who could do
      something besides horse-racing and cock-fighting&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So she did," said Scanlan, interrupting, with some confusion. "She said
      somebody had told her of young Nelligan. She called you 'Young Nelligan.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; it was to myself she said it, and the words were, 'Mr. Joseph
      Nelligan;' and then, when her uncle said, 'Why don't we know him? '&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Simmy, you make a most horrible confusion when you attempt a
      story,&mdash;out of canvas. Mind, I said out of canvas; for I confess that
      in your grand 'Historical' the whole incident is admirably detailed. I 've
      just said to my friend here, that he has a great pleasure before him in
      seeing that picture."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you 'll do me the honor to look at it," said Crow, bowing courteously,
      "when you come to dinner to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Attend to <i>me</i>, Joe," said Scanlan, passing an arm within
      Nelligan's, and leading him away to another part of the room; "that fellow
      is little better than an idiot. But I was just going to tell you what
      Martin said. 'You are intimate with young Nelligan,' said he; 'you know
      him well, and you could possibly do without awkwardness what with more
      formality might be difficult. Don't you think, then, that he would
      possibly waive ceremony&mdash;'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must be off," broke in Crow, hastily. "I have a sitting at twelve
      o'clock, so I hope we shall see you at seven, Mr. Nelligan; your note said
      seven, sharp." And without waiting for more, he seized his hat and hurried
      down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A downright fool!" said Scanlan, angrily. "Mr. Martin said he 'd write to
      you, if&mdash;if&mdash;if, in fact, you stood upon that punctilio; but
      that he'd be all the better pleased if you 'd just accept acquaintance as
      freely as he offered it, and come and dine there to-day, like a friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is n't there, or has there not been, some difference between him and my
      father?" asked Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A trifle,&mdash;and a mistake; the kind of thing that two men of calm
      heads and common sense could have settled in five minutes, and which, to
      say the truth, Martin was right in throughout. It's all passed and over
      now, however, and it would be worse than foolish to revive it. There 's
      Miss Martin!" cried he, "and I have a word to say to her;" and hurried off
      without waiting for more. As he passed from the room, however, a letter
      fell from his pocket; and as Nelligan stooped to take it up, he saw that
      it was addressed to himself. He looked hesitatingly at it for a moment or
      two, scarcely knowing whether or not he ought to break the seal. "It was
      meant for me, at all events," said he, and opened it. The contents were as
      follows;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Martin presents his respects to Mr. Joseph Nelligan, and will feel
      happy if&mdash;excusing the want of formal introduction&mdash;Mr. Nelligan
      will admit him to the honor of acquaintance, and give him the pleasure of
      his society at dinner, to-morrow, at seven o'clock. Mr. Martin does not
      hesitate to say that to accept this unceremonious proposal will be felt as
      a very great favor indeed by him and his family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does Scanlan mean by all this? Why not have handed me this note at
      once?" was Nelligan's question to himself, as he descended the stairs and
      gained the street. He was not sorry that Scanlan was not in sight, and
      hastened homeward to think over this strange communication. Joe well knew
      that his mother was not peculiarly endowed with worldly wisdom or
      acuteness; and yet such was his need of counsel at the moment, that he
      determined, at least in part, to lay the case before her. "She can
      certainly tell me," said he, "if there be any reason why I should decline
      this proposal." And with this resolve he entered the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you remember Catty Henderson, Joe?" said his mother, as he came
      into the room, and presenting a young girl, very plainly but neatly
      dressed, who arose to receive him with an air of well-bred composure,&mdash;"Catty,
      that used to be your playfellow long ago?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know you were in Ireland, Miss Henderson. I should never have
      recognized you," said Nelligan, in some confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor was I till a few days back," said she, in an accent very slightly
      tinged with a foreign pronunciation. "I came home on Tuesday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't she grown, joe? and such a fine girl, too. I always said she 'd be
      so; and when the others would have it that your nose was too long for the
      rest of your features, I said, 'Wait till she grows up,&mdash;wait till
      she 's a woman;' and see now if I 'm not right."
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be owned that Joe Nelligan's confusion during the delivery of this
      prophetic criticism was far greater than Catty's own, who received the
      speech with a low, gentle laugh, while Mrs. Nelligan went on: "I made her
      stay till you came back, Joe, for I wanted her to see what a tall creature
      you are, and not more than twenty,&mdash;her own age to a month; and I
      told her what a genius you turned out, indeed, to the surprise of us all,
      and myself, especially."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, mother," said he, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed, my dear, 't is your father you may thank for all your talents
      and abilities; a wonderful man he is, beginning the world without a
      sixpence; and there he is now, with I 'm sure I don't know how many
      hundreds a year in land,&mdash;ay, Catty, in broad acres; just like any
      squire in the county. Well, well, there 's many a change come over the
      country since you were here,&mdash;how many years is it now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upwards of twelve," said the young girl. "Dear me, how time flies! It
      seems like yesterday that you and Joe had the measles together, in the
      yellow room up at Broom Lodge, and your poor mother was alive then, and
      would insist on giving you everything cool to drink, just because you
      liked it, though I told her that was exactly the reason it was sure to be
      bad for you; for there 's nothing so true in life,&mdash;that everything
      we wish for is wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An unpleasant theory, certainly," said Catty, laughing; "but I hope not
      of universal application, for I have been long wishing to see you again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, who knows whether it may be good or bad," said she, sighing;
      "not but I 'm pleased to see you growing up the image of your poor dear
      mother,&mdash;taller, maybe, but not so handsome, nor so genteel-looking;
      but when you have your trials and troubles, as she had, maybe that will
      come, too, for I often remarked, there 's nothing like affliction to make
      one genteel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, mother, you are profuse in unhappy apothegms this morning," said
      Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are coming to stay amongst us now, Catty; or are you going back
      to France again?" said Mrs. Nelligan, not heeding the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I scarcely know, as yet," replied the young girl. "My father's letter to
      summon me home said something about placing me as a governess, if I were
      capable of the charge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you are, my dear, after all your advantages; not but that I 'd
      rather see you anything else,&mdash;a nice light business; for instance,
      in baby-linen or stationery, or in Miss Busk's establishment, if that
      could be accomplished."
    </p>
    <p>
      A very slight flush&mdash;so slight as to be nearly imperceptible&mdash;crossed
      the young girl's cheek, but not a syllable escaped her, as Mrs. Nelligan
      resumed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there was an excellent opening the other day at the Post here, in the
      circulating-library way, and lending out a newspaper or two. I don't know
      how much you might make of it. Not but maybe you 'd rather be companion to
      a lady, or what they call a 'nervous invalid.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That, too, has been thought of," said the girl, smiling; "but I have
      little choice in the matter, and, happily, as little preference for one as
      the other of these occupations. And now I must take my leave, for I
      promised to be back by two o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there's Joe will see you home with pleasure, and I 'm sure you have
      plenty to say to each other about long ago; not but I hope you 'll agree
      better than you did then. You were the torment of my life, the way you
      used to fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't think of trespassing on Mr. Joseph's time; I should be quite
      ashamed of imposing such trouble on him. So good-bye, godmamma; good-bye,
      Mr. Joseph," said she, hurriedly throwing her shawl around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will allow me to accompany you," said Joseph, scarcely knowing
      whether she rejected or accepted his escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure she will, and you have both more sense than to fall out now;
      and mind, Joseph, you 're to be here at four, for I asked Mrs. Cronan to
      dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that reminds me of something," said Joe, hurriedly; and he leaned
      over his mother's chair, and whispered to her, "Mr. Martin has invited me
      to dine with him to-day; here is his note, which came to me in rather a
      strange fashion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To dine at the Nest! May I never! But I scarcely can believe my eyes,"
      said Mrs. Nelligan, in ecstasy. "And the honor, and the pleasure, too;
      well, well, you 're the lucky boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall I do, mother; is n't there something between my father and
      him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will you do but go; what else would you do, I 'd like to know? What
      will they say at the Post when they hear it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I want you to hear how this occurred."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well; I don't care,&mdash;go you must, Joe. But there 's poor Catty
      walking away all alone; just overtake her, and say that a sudden
      invitation from the Martins&mdash;mention it as if you were up there every
      day&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But young Nelligan did not wait for the conclusion of this artful counsel,
      but hurrying after Catty Henderson, overtook her as she had gained the
      beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no need of an escort, Mr. Joseph," said she, good-humoredly. "I
      know every turn of the way here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you'll not refuse my companionship?" said he. "We have scarcely
      spoken to each other yet." And as he spoke he drew his arm within her own,
      and they walked along in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother thinks we did nothing but quarrel long ago," said he, after a
      pause; "but if my memory serves me truly, it was upon this very pathway we
      once swore to each other vows of a very different kind. Do you recollect
      anything of that, Miss Henderson?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, Mr. Joseph," said she, with a sly half-glance as she uttered the
      last word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why 'Mr. Joseph'?" said he, half reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why 'Miss Henderson'?" said she, with a malicious smile at the other's
      confusion; for somehow Joseph's manner was far less easy than her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I scarcely know why," replied he, after a short silence, "except that you
      seem so changed; and I myself, too, am probably in your eyes as much
      altered&mdash;from what we both were, that&mdash;that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That, in short, it would be impossible to link the past with the
      present," said she, quickly; "and you were quite right. I 'm convinced the
      effort is always a failure, and prejudices in a hundred ways the good
      qualities of those who attempt it. Let us, therefore, begin our
      acquaintance here; learn to know each other as we are,&mdash;that is, if
      we are to know each other at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you say that?" asked he, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For many reasons. We may not meet often; perhaps not at all; perhaps
      under circumstances where to renew intimacy might be difficult. Assuredly,
      although the path here might once have sufficed us, our roads in life lie
      widely apart now, and the less we travel together the more we shall each
      go towards his own goal, and&mdash;and the less regret we shall feel at
      parting; and so now good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wish it?" said he, reproachfully. "You desire this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What matters it whether I wish it or not? I know it must be. Good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye, then,&mdash;good-bye," said he, affecting as much indifference
      as he could; and then, slightly raising his hat, he turned away on the
      road homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph Nelligan's reflections were not of the pleasantest as he sauntered
      slowly back. He was not exactly satisfied with himself; he felt, he could
      not just say how, that the young girl had had the mastery over him; she
      was more calm or self-possessed; she had more tact, or she knew more of
      life; had more of self-control, or breeding, or some other quality,
      whatever it might be, than he had. At all events, he was ill at ease and
      discontented. Then he doubted whether he ought to have taken her at her
      word when she talked of parting. It might, possibly, have been meant by
      her to evoke some show of resistance on his part; that same inequality of
      station she seemed to hint at might, perhaps, demand from him a greater
      deference. In fact, whichever way he turned the matter over, he saw little
      cause for self-gratulation; nor did he discover that it mended matters
      when he tried to accuse her of French frivolity, and such other traits as
      he fancied of foreign origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this not over-pleasant mood was it that he re-entered the cottage,
      where his mother was busy in preparing a very formidable cravat for the
      approaching dinner-party.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Joe!" said she, anxiously, "if you were to dress now, and then stay
      quiet, you 'd be quite fresh when the time came; for, remember, it's not
      like your father you are, that has the world about him, and can converse
      about everything that comes uppermost; but with all your learning, you
      know, you always feel somehow&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stupid, mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not stupid, my dear, but depressed,&mdash;out of spirits in society; so
      that my advice to you is, now, dress yourself in good time, take a small
      glass of ginger-cordial, and throw your eye over the second chapter of
      'Social Hints,' with an account of conversation before and at dinner, and
      some excellent advice about'compliments, meet for every season of the
      year.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think such preparations quite necessary, mother?" asked Joe,
      slyly; for he rather relished the simplicity of her counsels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure, I do; for yours is no common difficulty, Joe. If you talk of
      country matters, you 'll get into Kyle's Wood and the Chancery suit; if
      you touch politics or religion, it will be worse again. The Martins, I
      hear, never play cards, so you can't allude to them; and they 'll be too
      grand to know anything about poor Miss Cuddy going off with the sergeant
      of police, or what Con Kelly did with his aunt's furniture."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that really the topics open to me are marvellously few."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there's shooting; but to be sure you know nothing about that, nor
      fishing, either; and I suppose farming, if you did understand it, would
      n't be genteel. Indeed, I see little that is n't dangerous, except the
      dearness of everything. I remark that's a subject nobody ever tires of,
      and all can take their share in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I conclude it to be fact, mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very melancholy fact, my dear; and so I said to Betty Gargan,
      yesterday. 'It's well for <i>you</i>,' said I, 'and the likes of you, that
      use nothing but potatoes; but think of us, that have to pay sixpence a
      pound for mutton, six-and-a-half for the prime pieces, and veal not to be
      had under eightpence.' They talk of the poor, indeed! but sure they never
      suffer from a rise in butcher's meat, and care nothing at all what tea
      costs. I assure you I made the tears come into her eyes, with the way I
      described our hardships."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that this will be a safe subject for me, mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly safe, my dear, and no ways mean, either; for I always remarked
      that the higher people are, the stingier they are, and the more pleasure
      they take in any little sharp trick that saves them sixpence. And when
      that 's exhausted, just bring in the Rams."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Rams?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean my aunt Ram, and my relations in Wexford. I 'm sure, with a little
      address, you 'll be able to show how I came to be married beneath me, and
      all the misery it cost me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, mother, I believe I have now ample material," said Joe, rising,
      with a lively dread of an opening which he knew well boded a lengthy
      exposition; "and to my own want of skill must it be ascribed if I do not
      employ it profitably." And with this he hurried to his room to prepare for
      the great event.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Gentlemen of England" do not deem it a very formidable circumstance
      to repair towards seven, or half-past, to a dinner-party, even of the
      dullest and most rigid kind. There is a sombre "routine" in these cases,
      so recognized that each goes tolerably well prepared for the species of
      entertainment before him. There is nothing very exhilarating in the
      prospect, and as little to depress. It is a leaf torn out of one of the
      tamest chapters in life's diary, where it is just as rare to record a new
      dish as a new idea, and where the company and the cookery are both
      foreknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one goes with any exaggerated expectations of enjoyment; but as little
      does he anticipate anything to discompose or displease him. The whole
      thing is very quiet and well-bred; rather dull, but not unpleasant. Now,
      Joseph Nelligan had not graduated as a "diner-out;" he was about as
      ignorant of these solemn festivals as any man well could be. He was not,
      therefore, without a certain sense of anxiety as to the conversational
      requisites for such occasions. Would the company rise to themes and places
      and people of which he had never as much as heard? or would they treat of
      ordinary events, and if so, on what terms? If politics came to be
      discussed, would Mr. Martin expect him to hear in silence opinions from
      which he dissented? Dare he speak his sentiments, at the cost of directing
      attention to himself?&mdash;a course he would fain have avoided. These,
      and innumerable other doubts, occupied him as he was dressing, and made
      him more than once regret that he had determined to accept this
      invitation; and when the hour at last came for him to set out, he felt a
      sense of shrinking terror of what was before him greater than he had ever
      known as he mounted the dreaded steps of the College Examination Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He might, it is true, have bethought him of the fact that where Simmy Crow
      and Maurice Scanlan were guests, he too might pass muster without
      reproach; but he did not remember this, or, at least, it failed to impress
      him sufficiently. Nor was his dread without a certain dash of vanity, as
      he thought of the contrast between the humble place he was perhaps about
      to occupy at a great man's table, and the proud one he had achieved in the
      ranks of scholarship and science. Thus musing, he sauntered slowly along
      till he found himself in front of the little garden of the Osprey's Nest.
      He looked at his watch,&mdash;it was exactly seven; so he pulled the bell,
      and entered.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. THE MARTIN ARMS
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the small and not over-neat parlor of the Martin Arms at Oughterard, a
      young man sat at his breakfast, at times casting his eyes over the columns
      of the "Vindicator," and anon strolling to the window to watch the
      gathering of the country people at the weekly market. The scene was one of
      that mingled bustle and languor so characteristically Irish. Cart-loads of
      turf, vegetables, fruit, or turkeys blocked up the narrow passage between
      booths of fancy wares, gilt jewelry, crockery, and cutlery; the vendors
      all eagerly vociferating commendations of their stores, in chorus with
      still more clamorous beggars, or the discordant notes of vagrant
      minstrelsy. Some animal monstrosity, announced by a cracked-voiced herald
      and two clarionets, added to a din to which loud laughter contributed its
      share of uproar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assemblage was entirely formed of the country people, many of whom
      made the pretext of having a pig or a lamb to sell the reason of their
      coming; but, in reality, led thither by the native love of a gathering,&mdash;that
      fondness to be where their neighbors were,&mdash;without any definite aim
      or object. There was, then, in strong contrast to the anxious solicitation
      of all who had aught to sell, the dreary, languid, almost apathetic look
      of the mere lounger, come to while away his weary hour and kill time just
      like any very bored fine gentleman who airs his listlessness along St
      James's Street, or lazily canters his <i>ennui</i> down Rotten Row.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Massingbred&mdash;for he was the traveller whose straw hat and
      knapsack stood upon a table near&mdash;was amused at a scene so full of
      its native characteristics. The physiognomy, the dress, the bearing of the
      people, their greetings as they met, their conduct of a bargain, all
      bespoke a nation widely differing from the sister country, and set him
      a-dreaming as to how it was that equality of laws might very possibly
      establish anything but equality of condition amongst people so dissimilar.

      While thus musing, his eye chanced to rest upon the half-effaced
      inscription over a shop door in front, and where the name of Daniel
      Nelligan figured as "licensed for all kinds of groceries and spirits."
      "Nelligan," repeated he to himself, "I shall certainly quiz my friend Joe,
      when we meet, about his namesake in Oughterard. How good it would be to
      pick up some details of our friend opposite to torment him with! What rare
      fun to affect to have discovered a near relative in this man of hides,
      glue, sugar, and Jamaica rum! Eh, gad, I'll try it." And with this resolve
      he crossed the street at once, and soon found himself in the compact crowd
      which thronged the doorway of this popular shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, indeed, a busy scene, since many who were there came as much
      sellers as buyers, giving all the complexity of barter to their several
      transactions. Here was a staid country-woman exchanging her spunyarn, or
      her "cloth," as it is called, for various commodities in tea, candles, and
      such like; here a farmer, with a sample of seed-oats in his
      pocket-handkerchief, of which he wanted the value in certain farm
      utensils; here was another, with a stout roll of home-made frieze to
      dispose of; some were even fain to offer a goose or a hen as the medium
      for a little tobacco, or some equally tempting luxury of cottier life. But
      there was another class of customers, who, brushing their way through the
      throng, made for a small, dingy-looking chamber behind the shop, in which
      Mr. Nelligan performed the functions of banker and money-lender,
      discounting small bills, advancing loans, and transacting all the various
      duties of a petty capitalist,&mdash;means by which, it was alleged, he had
      already amassed a very ample fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      An announcement in writing on the glass door of this sanctum informed
      Massingbred that "bank-notes" were exchanged, and "small loans advanced on
      good security," suggesting to him at once the means of opening an
      acquaintance with the interior. Without any very definite purpose,
      however, he now found himself one of a very closely packed crowd within
      the chamber. At a small desk, around which ran a railing of about a foot
      in height, serving, as it were, to "filter the stream" of solicitation
      that poured in upon him, sat a dark-eyed, bilious-looking man of about
      fifty; a black wig, cut in two deep arches over the temples, showed a
      strongly formed, massive head, very favorably in contrast to the features
      beneath it, which were only indicative of intense shrewdness and cunning.
      The eyes, in particular, were restless and furtive-looking, distrust and
      suspicion giving their entire expression,&mdash;qualities, it was to be
      owned, in very active employment in the intercourse of his daily life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The anxious looks around him&mdash;careworn, eager, tremulous with anxiety
      as they were&mdash;seemed the very opposite to his own, full of the
      security that a strong purse bestows, and stern in the conscious strength
      of his affluence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It won't do, Hagan," said he, with a half-smile, as he pushed back
      through the grating a very dirty, discolored piece of paper. "You 'll be
      off to America before it comes due. I would n't take the Lord-Lieutenant's
      note at six months, as times go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "See, now, Mr. Nelligan," replied the other, pressing his face close to
      the cage, and talking with intense eagerness. "May I never see Christmas,
      but I 'll pay it 'T was marryin' the daughter left me low in cash; but
      with the blessing of God and your help&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you 're more certain of the blessing than the help. What's this
      with the string round it?" continued Nelligan, addressing another
      applicant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'T is a roll of notes I wanted to ax your honor about. Molly never 'let
      on' she had them till Friday last; and now that James is going away, and
      wants a trifle to fit him out&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, they're French's Bank, man, that broke years ago,&mdash;they 're not
      worth a farthing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arrah, don't say so, and God reward you," cried the poor fellow, while
      his eyes filled up and his lip trembled convulsively; "don't take the hope
      out of my heart all at onst. Look at them again, your honor, and maybe you
      'll think different."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I did, I 'd be as great a fool as yourself, Patsy. The bank is closed,
      and the banker dead this many a day; and I would n't give you sixpence for
      sixty thousand of them. Take him out in the fresh air,&mdash;give him a
      mouthful of water," added he, hastily, as the wretched countryman
      staggered back, sick, and almost fainting with the sad tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Mooney," said he, addressing a pale, mild-featured woman in a
      widow's cap and black gown, "you can't expect to hear from Dublin for a
      week or ten days to come. It takes some time to administer; but if you are
      in want of a few pounds&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, thank you," said she, in a low voice; "but as I can't go back to
      the place again,&mdash;as I 'll never be able to live there now&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be in a hurry, Mrs. Mooney, do nothing rash. None of us know what
      we can do till we 're tried. There's Miles Dogherty never thought he 'd be
      paying me that eight pound fifteen he owes me, and see now if he is n't
      come with it to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix, and I am not," sturdily responded a very powerfully built man in
      the comfortable dress of a substantial farmer. "I don't owe it, and I 'll
      never pay it; and what's more, if you get a decree against me to-morrow,
      I'd sell every stick and stone in the place and go to 'Quay bec'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed you would n't, Miles, not a bit more than I'd go and take the law
      of an old friend and neighbor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix, I never thought you would," said the stout man, wiping his
      forehead, and appearing as if he had forgotten his wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, Miles, what about that water-course?" said Nelligan,
      good-humoredly; "are you content to leave it to any two fair men&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he got thus far, his eye for the first time fell upon Massingbred, who,
      with folded arms, was leaning against a wall, an attentive spectator of
      the whole scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a stranger yonder! what can he want here?" said Nelligan, who
      watched the attentive look of Massingbred's face with considerable
      distrust. He whispered a few words into the ear of a man beside him, who,
      making his way through the crowd, addressed the young man with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the master, sir, wants to know if he could do anything for your
      honor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For <i>me?</i> oh, you spoke to <i>me?</i>" said Massingbred, suddenly
      recalled to himself. "Yes, to be sure; I wanted to know&mdash;that is, I
      was thinking&mdash;" And he stopped to try and remember by what device he
      had purposed making Mr. Nelligan's acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he thus stood doubting and confused, his eyes suddenly met the
      black, searching, deep-set orbs that peered at him behind the grating; and
      without knowing how or why, he slowly approached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way can I be of any use to you, sir?" said Nelligan, in a tone
      which very palpably demanded the reason of his presence there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Massingbred was eminently "cool,"&mdash;that is, he was possessed of
      that peculiar assurance which rarely suffers itself to be ruffled by a
      difficulty. In the intercourse of society, and with men of the world, he
      could have submitted to any test unabashed; and yet now, in presence of
      this shrewd-looking and very commonplace personage, he, somehow, felt
      marvellously ill at ease, and from the simple reason that the man before
      whom he stood was not of his "world," but one of a set of whose habits and
      thoughts and ways he was in utter ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nelligan's question was a second time addressed to him, and in the same
      words, before he thought of framing a reply to it. For a second or two it
      occurred to him to say that he had strolled in, half inadvertently, and
      apologizing for the intrusion, to withdraw; but his pride was offended at
      the notion of defeat this conduct implied, and with an assumption of that
      conventional impudence far more natural to him, he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was your name, sir, attracted me&mdash;the name 'Nelligan' which I
      read over your door&mdash;being that of a very dear and valued friend of
      mine, suggested to me to inquire whether you might not be relatives."
    </p>
    <p>
      The cool indifference which accompanied these words, uttered as they were
      in a certain languid drawl, were very far from predisposing Nelligan in
      favor of the speaker; while the pretence of attaching any singularity to a
      name so common as his own, struck him at once as indicative of covert
      impertinence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nelligan is not a very remarkable name down here, sir," dryly responded
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very possibly," replied Jack, with all his accustomed ease. "I know
      little or nothing of Ireland. Your namesake, or your relative, perhaps,
      was a college friend of mine, but to what part of the country he belonged,
      I never knew."
    </p>
    <p>
      The words, "a college friend," roused the other's anxiety, and leaning
      forward eagerly, and dropping his voice to a whisper, he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where? In what college, may I ask, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Trinity, Dublin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Medallist of this year, you mean?" said the other, almost breathless
      in his anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so. The same fellow who has been sweeping away all the honors of his
      day. You have heard of him, it would seem?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is my son, sir. I 'm Joe Nelligan's father!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Massingbred's astonishment did not betray itself by any change of feature;
      not a word escaped him; but his eye ranged over the scene around him, and
      came back to rest upon old Nelligan's face with an expression of the
      calmest meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a fortunate accident&mdash;for <i>me</i>, I mean," continued he.
      "Joe and I are very dear friends, and it is a great happiness for me to
      make his father's acquaintance. Is he with you now?" "No, sir; he's at the
      sea,&mdash;a place called Kilkieran, about twenty miles away; but we 'll
      have him back by tomorrow if you 'll stay with us, and I 'm sure you 'll
      not refuse me that pleasure. The young gentleman who is my son's friend,
      is mine also, if he 'll permit me to call him so; and now just tell me
      what name shall I say?&mdash;who is it that I 'm to tell Joe has arrived
      here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say that Jack Massingbred is come, and I 'll lay my life on't you'll see
      him here as fast as may be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, Mr. Massingbred, just take up your quarters with us. Where are
      you stopping? I 'll send over the boy for your trunks, for I need n't say
      that this must be your home while you stay at Oughterard." The genial tone
      of warm hospitality in which he now spoke made him seem a very different
      man from the hard-featured old money-lender he had appeared when Jack
      first beheld him, and Massingbred returned his cordial shake hands with a
      pressure equal to his own, while he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be assured that I accept your offer most heartily. My whole baggage is a
      knapsack and a fishing-rod, so that if you admit me as your guest you must
      dispense with all beyond the very humblest requirements. I have no coat,
      except this on me; and, when I brush my hair, I have dressed for dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are amongst very humble people, Mr. Massingbred,&mdash;a country
      shopkeeper, and his wife, and son,&mdash;and they 'll be only too happy to
      feel that you don't despise their company. Come, and I 'll show you your
      room." And so saying, Nelligan led him up a narrow stair, and at the end
      of a corridor opened a door into a neatly furnished chamber, which looked
      out into a spacious garden. The whole interior was scrupulously clean and
      comfortable; and as Jack surveyed his new dominions, he inwardly blessed
      his good fortune that had piloted him into such a haven.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll just step down and write to Joe. Meanwhile you 'll have your things
      brought over to you. Make yourself at home here&mdash;at least, as much as
      you can in such a place&mdash;and when you want anything, just ask for
      it." And with these words old Nelligan left him to his own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever savored of an adventure was the delight of Jack Massingbred. He
      was one of those men whose egotism takes the shape of playing hero to
      themselves,&mdash;a tolerably large category amongst the spoiled children
      of this world. To be thrown into any strange or novel position, with
      associates he was unused to, and amidst circumstances totally unlike all
      he had ever met before, was his great happiness; and although here there
      was nothing like actual peril to heighten the zest of the enjoyment, there
      was a certain dash of embarrassment in the situation that increased its
      piquancy. This embarrassment lay in his approaching meeting with young
      Nelligan.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the reserve his young college friend had maintained with regard to his
      family was at once explained; and Jack began to think over how often it
      must have occurred to him to say the most galling and offensive things in
      his ignorance of Nelligan's real station. "If he had been frank and open
      with me," said he to himself, "this would never have happened." But
      therein Jack made two errors, since Nelligan was in no wise bound to make
      such revelations, nor was Massingbred the man to distinguish himself
      amongst his associates by a close friendship with the son of a country
      shopkeeper. He had been trained in a very different school, and taught to
      estimate his own station by the standard of his companionship. Indeed, he
      had witnessed the lenity which met his transgressions when they occurred
      in high company, and saw his father pay the debts he had contracted
      amongst titled associates with a far more generous forgiveness than had
      they taken their origin with more plebeian friends. "What could have
      induced the man to become a Fellow-Commoner," said he, over and over; "it
      is such a palpable piece of presumption?" The truth was, Jack felt
      excessively irritated at never having even suspected his friend's
      pretensions, and was eager to throw the blame of a deception where none
      had ever been practised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They told me I should find everything very different here from in
      England, but they never hinted at anything like this." There came then
      another phase over his reflections, as he asked himself, "But what affair
      is it of mine? Nelligan never thrust himself on me, it was I that sought
      him. He never proposed introducing me to his family, it was I that made
      them out,&mdash;I, in fact, who have imposed myself upon them. If I deemed
      the old grocer <i>infra dig.</i>, I need never have known him; but I have
      not felt this to be the case. He may be&mdash;indeed, Joe Nelligan's
      father ought to be&mdash;a very superior fellow, and at all events the
      whole situation is new, and must be amusing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the course of his thoughts as he arranged his clothes in the
      little chest of drawers, put out his few books and papers on the table,
      and proceeded to make himself perfectly at home and comfortable in his new
      quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The embarrassments of selfish men are always lighter than those of other
      people, their egotism filling, as it does, such a very large space in the
      sea of their troubles. Thus was it that Massingbred suffered little
      discomfort at the thought of his friend Nelligan's probable shame and
      awkwardness, his thoughts being occupied by how he, clever fellow that he
      was, had traced out his home and origin,&mdash;won, by a few words, the
      old father's esteem, and established himself, by his own sharp wits, a
      guest of his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a downright adventure," said he; he even thought how the thing
      would tell afterwards at some convivial meeting, and set about dramatizing
      to himself his own part in the incident, to heighten the piquancy of the
      narrative. He resolved to conform in everything to the habits of the
      household,&mdash;to accommodate himself in all respects to old Nelligan's
      tastes, so that Joe should actually be amazed at the versatile resources
      of his nature, and struck with astonishment at this new evidence of his
      powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was Mr. Nelligan idle during all this time; the thought of a fellow
      collegian of his son Joe being a guest under his roof was a very proud and
      inspiring reflection. It was such a recognition of Joe's social claims,&mdash;so
      flat a contradiction to all the surmises of those who deprecated his
      college life, and said "that old Dan was wrong to put his boy into
      Trinity"&mdash;that he already regarded the incident as the full earnest
      of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would have brought him here, if it wasn't for Joe? How would he ever
      have been under my roof, if he wasn't Joe's friend?" There was a palpable
      triumph here that nothing could gainsay, and with a proud heart he locked
      up his desk, resolving to do no more business that day, but make it one of
      enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who will I get to dine with us," thought he, "since Joe can't have the
      letter before this evening, and do his best he won't be here before
      morning?" The question of those who should fill the places around his
      board was a difficulty he had never experienced before, for Mr. Nelligan
      was the first man in Oughterard, and never had any trouble about his
      dinner company. His politics&mdash;very decided as they were&mdash;drew
      the line amongst his acquaintances, and the Liberal party well knew that
      they alone were the partakers of his hospitalities. There now, however,
      came the thought that the most respectable residents of the town&mdash;Dr.
      Dasy, of the Infirmary; Mr. Scanlan, the Attorney; and Morris Croft, the
      Adjutant of the Galway&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;were Conservatives. These were
      the fit company to meet young Massingbred, at least for the first day;
      afterwards, he might be introduced to their own set. And yet, Father Neal
      Rafferty would be outraged at all this. Peter Hayes, of the Priory, would
      never enter his doors again; and Peter Hayes had made a will in favor of
      Joe Nelligan, and left him every sixpence he had in the world. "What if we
      mixed them all together?" said Dan, fairly puzzled by all the conflicting
      interests. "A good dinner, some excellent port wine, and 'lashings' of
      whiskey-punch, might mould the ingredients together&mdash;at least, when
      under the restraint of a stranger's presence&mdash;sufficiently to pass
      muster!"
    </p>
    <p>
      From his doubts as to how the experiment would succeed, came others as to
      whether the guests would condescend to meet; and thus his embarrassments
      went on increasing around him without his finding a way through them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's an elegant salmon I saw Catty bringing home to you, Nelligan?"
      said a red-faced man, with large white whiskers, and a most watery look in
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Brierley, there's a young gentleman just come down here&mdash;a
      friend of Joe's in college, to stop a day or two with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A nob?" said the other, with a wink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nelligan nodded assent and went on,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I 'm just bothered how to get two or three to make company for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it's grandeur you want, why don't you go over to the barracks there,
      and ask Captain Downie and the two others? Faix! it's a hearty welcome you
      'd get, for they 've never seen the inside of Cro' Martin since the
      detachment came here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It 's my own acquaintances I 'd like to ask to my house, Mat Brierley,"
      said Nelligan, proudly; "and the time was when they were n't shy of coming
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you say to Peter Hayes, then?" said the other. "If you mean to do
      the civil thing, you'll ask him before he buys that old highwayman of a
      goose he's cheapening yonder; and there's Father Rafferty in the
      snuff-shop, and Tom Magennis, and myself-, and that makes six, just the
      right number for the little round table."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nelligan paused, and seemed to reflect over the proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 'll be quizzing the Englishman,&mdash;'taking a rise' out of the
      Saxon, Brierley?" said Nelligan, distrustfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Devil a bit; I know better manners than that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom Magennis would have at him about politics; I know he could n't
      refrain. And I need n't tell you that English notions are not ours upon
      these topics."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give Tom a hint, and he 'll never touch the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Father Neal, will you vouch for him that he won't attack the
      Established Church, and abuse the Protestants?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I will, if he's not provoked to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you answer for yourself, Mat Brierley, that you won't try to borrow a
      five-pound note of him before the evening's over?" said Nelligan,
      laughingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I' ve a friend here," said Brierley, tapping the other on the breast,
      "that would never see me in want of such a trifle as that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nelligan made no other reply to this speech than a somewhat awkward
      grimace, and walked hurriedly on to overtake a tall and very fat man that
      was just turning the corner of the street. This was Father Neal Rafferty.
      A very flourishing wave of his reverence's hand, and an urbane bend of his
      body, betokened the gracious acceptance he gave to the other's invitation;
      and Brierley walked away, muttering to himself: "They may thank me for
      this dinner, then; for old Dan was going to feed the 'swells,' if I had
      n't stopped him."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. A DINNER-PARTY
    </h2>
    <p>
      People who live much together in small and secluded districts, grow at
      length to feel a very great distrust for all strangers. Their own ways and
      their own topics have become such a perfect world to them, that to feel
      ignorant of these themes appears like affectation or contempt; and the
      luckless man who drops down into such a "coterie," is invariably deemed
      impertinent or a fool. Jack Massing-bred fully appreciated this
      difficulty; but it imparted such a piquancy to his "adventure," as he
      persisted in calling it to himself, that he would n't have dispensed with
      it, had he been able. It was in this temper he entered the room where the
      guests were now assembled, and, rather impatiently, awaiting his arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a very cold, calculating sort of interval, that ten minutes before
      dinner; and men regard the stranger presented to them with feelings far
      more critical than kindly. Massingbred did not go through the ordeal
      unscathed; and it was easy to see in the constraint and reserve of all
      present, how little his appearance contributed to the promise of future
      conviviality. He made no effort to dispel this impression, for, after
      saluting each in turn, he walked to the window, and amused himself with
      what was passing in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was announced at last, and passed off drearily enough; none
      liked to adventure on any topic of local interest, and they knew of little
      others. Brierley was stiffly polite; the priest blandly tranquil; the host
      himself uneasy and anxious; and poor old Peter Hayes, of the Priory,
      downright melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massingbred saw the effect he was producing, and saw it with pleasure. His
      calculation was this: "Had I started 'at speed' with these fellows, they
      would have blown me at once. All my efforts to assimilate myself to their
      tastes, to join in their habits and adopt their notions, would have been
      detected in a trice. They must be brought to believe that they have made a
      convert of me themselves; the wider the space between us at first, the
      greater will be their merit in making me forget it in the end."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the whiskey-punch made its appearance, and the bottle of port was
      passed up beside the stranger, Massingbred thought the time was come when
      he might change his tactics, and open the campaign in force. "No," said
      he, as the host pushed the wine towards him, "I 've come over here to try
      and learn something about Ireland, and I must give myself every advantage
      of judging from a native point of view. This excellent old port may
      strengthen a man to stand by many an old prejudice, but my object is to
      lay in a new stock of ideas, and I 'd rather try a new regimen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That 's your bottle, then, sir. Try that," said Brierley, pushing towards
      him a small square decanter of a faint greenish fluid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is 'poteen,' Mr. Massingbred," said the host. "It's the small still
      that never paid the King a farthing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like it all the better, for that reason," said Jack. "There's something
      independent in the very thought of a liquor that never submitted to the
      indignity of a gauger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not a very English sentiment, sir," said the priest, slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know whether it be or not," rejoined Massingbred; "but I can
      neither perceive common-sense or justice in a law that will not allow a
      man to do what he likes with his own. Why, if Parliament declared
      to-morrow you should n't boil your potatoes in Ireland, but eat them fried&mdash;or
      that you should n't make bread of your corn, but eat it with milk as the
      Neapolitans do&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish we could do the same here, with all my heart," said the priest.
      "It's little wheat or even barley-meal one of our poor people ever sees."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A wet potato and water is their diet," said old Hayes, as he sipped his
      punch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can believe it well," said Massingbred, with great semblance of
      feeling. "I witnessed dreadful poverty and destitution as I came along,
      and I couldn't help asking myself: What are the gentry about in this
      country? Do they or do they not see these things? If they do, are they
      indifferent to them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are indifferent to them; or even worse, they rejoice in them," broke
      in a deep-voiced, energetic-looking man, who sat at the foot of the table,
      and had, although silent, taken a deep interest in the conversation. "They
      see, sir, in the destitution of Ireland another rivet in the chains of her
      bondage. As my 'august leader' remarked, it's the rust on the fetters,
      though&mdash;and if it proclaims the length of the captivity, it suggests
      the hope of freedom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Magennis is the dearest friend and trusty agent of Mr. O'Connell,"
      said Nelligan, in a whisper to Massingbred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's his health, whoever said that!" cried Jack, enthusiastically, and
      as if not hearing the host's observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a toast; we'll all drink&mdash;and standing, too," exclaimed
      Magennis. "'Daniel O'Connell, gentlemen, hip, hip, hurra! '" And the room
      rang again with the hearty acclamations of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove! there was something very fine&mdash;it was chivalrous&mdash;in
      the way he brought the Catholic question to issue at last. The bold
      expedient of testing the event by an individual experience was as clever
      as it was daring," exclaimed Massingbred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were in favor of the measure then, sir?" said Father Neal, with a
      bland smile that might mean satisfaction or suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was always an Emancipationist; but I am little satisfied with the terms
      on which the bill has been passed. I 'd have had no restrictions,&mdash;no
      reservations. It should, according to me, have been unconditional or
      nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've heard the old proverb about half a loaf, sir?" said Hayes, with a
      dry laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a poor adage it is, in its ordinary acceptation," said Jack, quickly.
      "It 's the prompting spirit to many a shabby compromise! What disabilities
      should apply to any of us here, in regard to any post or position in our
      country's service, by reason of opinions which are between ourselves and
      our own hearts&mdash;I say any of us, because some here&mdash;one I
      perceive is"&mdash;and he bowed to Father Rafferty&mdash;"a Catholic; and
      I for myself avow that, if for no other reason than this proscription, I'd
      be on this side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not in Parliament, sir, are you?" asked old Peter, with a
      seriousness that sorely tested the gravity of those at either side of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Jack, frankly. "My father and I don't agree on these subjects;
      and, consequently, though there is a seat in my family, I have not the
      honor to occupy it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you any relation to Colonel Moore Massingbred, sir?" asked Magennis.
      "His son, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      The questioner bowed, and a brief silence ensued; short as it was, it
      enabled Jack to decide upon his next move, and take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen," said he, "I 'm fully aware that my name is not a favorite in
      Ireland; and shall I own to you, till I came to this country myself, I
      half believed that this same humble opinion of us was to our credit! I
      used to hear such narratives of Irish barbarism, Irish brutality,
      priestcraft, superstition, and Heaven knows what besides, that I fully
      persuaded myself that our small repute was very nigh to an eulogium on us.
      Well, I came over to Trinity College strongly impressed with the notion
      that, because I had gained successes at Oxford, here I should be
      triumphant. It is in no boastfulness I say that I had acquitted myself
      well at home; I had attained to rather a reputation. Well, as I said, I
      came over to Trinity and pitted myself against the best man going, and a
      very pretty beating he gave me. Yes, gentlemen, he beat me in everything,
      even in those which we Oxford men fancy our specialties. I soon learned
      that I had not the shadow of a pretension to stand against him, and I
      learned, also, that it was no disgrace to me to be thus vanquished, since
      he was not alone the foremost man of his time, but the best scholar the
      University had seen for a full century; and shall I add, as unpretending
      and as modest in the midst of all his triumphs as he was unapproachable by
      all competitors. And now; gentlemen, I will ask your leave to drink his
      health; doubtless it has been many a time toasted before over the same
      table, but none ever more ardently followed the sentiment with his whole
      heart than do I in proposing to you, 'Three cheers for Joe Nelligan.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The rambling opening of this brief speech was quite forgotten in the
      enthusiasm that greeted its close. In every respect it was a happy
      diversion. It relieved the company from a discussion that promised but
      gloomily. It brought back their minds to a pleasant theme, and enabled
      them, so to say, to pay off in grateful cheers to their host his own
      hospitable reception of them. As for Nelligan himself, he was sincerely,
      deeply affected; and though he twice essayed to speak, he could get no
      further than "My son Joe"&mdash;"my boy"&mdash;and sat down murmuring&mdash;"Thank
      you&mdash;God bless you for it"&mdash;and covered his face with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Awkward as was the moment, it was relieved by the company filling their
      glasses and nodding in most friendly fashion to Massingbred as they drank
      his health; while a low murmur of approbation went round the table, of
      which he was most unmistakably the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you fond of shooting, sir?" asked Brierley. "Well, then, I hope
      you'll not leave the country without giving me a day or two up at my
      little place in the mountains: There's some snipe left; and, upon my
      conscience, I'll be proud to see you at Kilmaccud."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there's worse quarters, too!" broke in Magennis. "My 'august leader'
      spent a day and a half there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll drive you over there myself," whispered Father Neal, "if you'll
      finish the week at the 'Rookery,'&mdash;that's what they call the priest's
      house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Massingbred accepted everything, and shook hands across the table in
      ratification of half a dozen engagements.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't think I'll let you cheat me out of my guest so easily," said
      Nelligan. "No, gentlemen. This must be Mr. Massingbred's head-quarters as
      long as he stays here, for, faith, I 'd not give him up to Mr. Martin
      himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who may he be?" asked Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Martin of Cro' Martin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The owner of half the county."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of the town you 're in, this minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The richest proprietor in the West."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the pattering replies that poured in upon him, while words of
      intense astonishment at his ignorance were exchanged on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe I have given you a fair guarantee for my ignorance, gentlemen,"
      said Jack, "in confessing that I never so much as heard of Martin of Cro'
      Martin. Does he reside on his estate here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," said Nelligan, "he lives at Cro' Martin Castle, about sixteen
      miles from this; and certainly, while in this part of the country, you
      ought to pay the place a visit. I have never been there myself, but I hear
      the most astonishing accounts of the splendor of the furniture and the
      magnificence of the whole establishment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's pictures there," said the priest, "that cost the grandfather of
      the present man a quarter of a million sterling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, the three statues in the hall, they say, are worth ten thousand
      pounds," said Brierley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be gorra! when a man would give four hundred for a bull, there 's no
      saying what he 'd stop at," broke in Peter Hayes. "I went up to see him
      myself, and indeed he's a beauty, there 's no denying it,&mdash;but four
      hundred pound! Think of four hundred pound!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The stable is the best thing in the place," said Father Neal; "they 're
      mighty nice cattle, there, for every kind of work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks to his niece for that," cried Magennis; "she knows a horse with
      any man in the West of Ireland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And can break him, too," chimed in Brierley; "I don't care what his
      temper is. Let Miss Mary get her hand on him, and he 'll turn out well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm driving an old chestnut mare this minute that she trained," said the
      priest; "and though she has n't a good leg amongst the four, and is
      touched in the wind, she 's as neat a stepper, and as easy in the mouth as
      a five-year-old."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She 's a fine young woman!" said old Hayes, drinking off his glass as
      though toasting her to himself, "and not like any Martin ever I seen
      before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No pride about her!" said Brierley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't exactly say that, Matthew," interposed Father Neal. "But her
      pride isn't the common kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's as proud as Lucifer!" broke in Nelligan, almost angrily. "Did you
      ever see her drive up to a shop-door in this town, and make the people
      come out to serve her, pointing with her whip to this, that, and t'other,
      and maybe giving a touch of the lash to the boy if he would n't be lively
      enough?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I 'd never call her proud," rejoined old Hayes, "after seeing her
      sitting in Catty Honan's cabin, and turning the bread on the griddle for
      her, when Catty was ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she handsome?" asked Massingbred, who was rather interested by the
      very discrepancy in the estimate of the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can agree upon that, I believe, sir," said the priest; "there 's no
      disputing about her beauty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never saw her in a room," said Magennis; "but my 'august leader'
      thought her masculine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," said Nelligan; "she 's not. She has the Martin manner,&mdash;overbearing
      and tyrannical,&mdash;if you like; but she can be gentle enough with women
      and children."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have certainly given me a strong curiosity to see her," said
      Massingbred. "Does she always live here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always. I don't believe she was ever beyond the bounds of the county in
      her life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how does she pass her time?" asked he, with some astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She manages the whole estate," said Nelligan; "her uncle 's a conceited
      old fool, incapable of anything, and lets her do what she likes; and so
      she drains, and plants, and encloses; makes roads, bridges, and even
      harbors; has all the new-fangled inventions about farming, and, if what I
      hear be true, is spending more money on the property than the fee-simple
      is worth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," chimed in Magennis; "and she 's trying hard to bring back the
      old feudal devotion to the Chief, which was the bane of Ireland. She wants
      the tenants to have no will of their own, but just to vote whatever the
      landlord tells them. She had the impudence to tell my 'august leader' that
      they had no need of him down there,&mdash;that the county was too poor to
      waste its energies in factious squabbles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she 'd let the people alone about their religion, I 'd think better of
      her," said Father Neal. "What does <i>she</i> know about controversial
      points and disputed dogmas?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe you 're wrong about that," broke in Peter Hayes. "She came to me
      the other day for ten shillings for a school, and she said, 'Come over,
      Mr. Hayes; come and tell me if there 's anything you are dissatisfied
      with.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And did you go?" asked the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix! I did not," said Peter, with a dry look. "I thought the visit might
      cost me ten shillings, and so I stayed at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      The manner in which he uttered these words produced a hearty laugh, in
      which he himself most good-humoredly took part.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, she's good to the poor, anyhow," said Brierley; "and it's a new
      thing for one of her name to be so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All policy, all scheming!" said Magennis. "She sees how the family
      influence has declined, and is fast becoming obliterated in this country,
      by reason of their worthlessness, insolence, and neglect of the people;
      and she 's just shrewd enough to see how far a little cajolery goes with
      poor Paddy; but, as my 'august leader' observed, it is not a frieze coat,
      nor a pair of brogues, that can compensate for the loss of that freedom
      that is every man's birthright; and it is not by an ounce of tea, or a
      dose of physic, we 'll ever see Ireland great, glorious, and free."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'First gem of the earth, and first flower of the sea!'" exclaimed Hayes,
      with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor in the moment was the blunder of his quotation noticed by any but
      Massingbred. "You are an admirer of Tommy Moore, I see, sir?" said he, to
      the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am fond of 'The Meeting of the Waters,' sir," said Hayes, meekly, and
      like a man who was confessing to a weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And here 's the man to sing it!" cried Brierley, clapping the priest
      familiarly on the shoulder; a proposal that was at once hailed with
      acclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'T is many a long day I have n't sung a note," said Father Neal,
      modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, Father Neal; we'll not let you off that way. It's not under
      this roof that you can make such an excuse!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He 'd rather give us something more to his own taste," said Brierley.
      "'To Ladies' eyes around, boys,'&mdash;eh, Father Rafferty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's my favorite of all the songs he sings," broke in Magennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let it be, 'To Ladies' eyes!'" cried Massingbred; "and we 'll drink 'Miss
      Martin's.' 'I 'll warrant she 'll prove an excuse for the glass.'" And he
      sang the line with such a mellow cadence that the whole table cheered him.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      To the priest's song, given with considerable taste and no mean musical
      skill, there followed, in due course, others, not exactly so successful,
      by Brierley and Magennis, and, at last, by old Peter himself, who warbled
      out a wonderful ditty, in a tone so doleful that two of the company fell
      fast asleep under it, and Brierley's nerves were so affected that, to
      support himself, he got most completely drunk, and in a very peremptory
      tone told the singer to desist!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you perceive," cried he, "that there 's a stranger present,&mdash;a
      young English cub,&mdash;come down to laugh at us? Have you no discretion,&mdash;have
      you no decency, Peter Hayes, but you must go on with your stupid old
      'croniawn' about dimples and the devil knows what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another tumbler, Mr. Massingbred,&mdash;one more?" said the host, with
      the air, however, of one who did not exact compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not for the world," said Jack, rising from table. "Have I your permission
      to light a cigar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To do just whatever you please," said Nelligan, rather astonished at the
      formal preparations for smoking he now perceived brought forth, and which
      at the time we tell of were not so popular as in our own day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest alone accepted Massingbred's offer of a "weed;" and Nelligan,
      opening a door into an adjoining room where tea was laid, threw also wide
      a little sash-door that led into the garden, whose cool and fragrant air
      was perfectly delicious at the moment. Jack strolled down the steps and
      soon lost himself in the dark alleys, not sorry to be left alone with his
      own thoughts, after a scene in which his convivial powers had been taxed
      to no mean extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A clever young fellow! There's stuff in him," said the priest, in a
      whisper to Nelligan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And no impudence about him," said Brierley; "he's just like one of
      ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has a wonderful opinion of Joe!" said Nelligan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's the very man for my 'august leader,'" said Magennis. "I 'd like to
      bring them together!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His father 's a Treasury Lord," said Nelligan, swelling at the thought of
      his being the host of such company!
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I 'll tell you what, Dan Nelligan," said the priest, confidentially,
      "talents won't do everything, nowadays, without high connections; mark my
      words, and see if that young man does n't stand high yet. He has just got
      every requirement of success. He has good family, good looks, good
      abilities, and"&mdash;here he dropped his voice still lower&mdash;"plenty
      of brass. Ay, Dan, if Joe could borrow a little of his friend's impudence,
      it would be telling him something."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nelligan nodded assentingly; it was about the only quality in the world
      which he could have believed Joe stood in any need of getting a loan of.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Joe beat him out of the field," said Dan, proudly. "He told me so
      himself, this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt; and he would again, where the contest was a college one; but
      'Life,' my dear friend,&mdash;life demands other gifts beside genius."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ganius!" broke in old Hayes, with an accent of the profoundest contempt,&mdash;"Ganius!
      I never knew a 'Ganius' yet that was n't the ruin of all belonging to him!
      And whenever I see a young fellow that knows no trade, nor has any
      livelihood, who's always borrowing here and begging there, a torment to
      his family and a burden to his friends, I set him down at once for a
      'Ganius.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not <i>that</i> I was alluding to, Mr. Hayes," said the priest, in
      some irritation. "I spoke of real ability, sterling powers of mind and
      thought, and I hope that they are not to be despised."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like my 'august leader's'!" said Magennis, proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, or like that young gentleman's there," said Father Neal, with the
      tone of a man pronouncing upon what he understood. "I watched him to-day
      at dinner, and I saw that every remark he made was shrewd and acute, and
      that whenever the subject was new to him, he fell into it as he went on
      talking, picking up his facts while he seemed to be discussing them! Take
      my word for it, gentlemen, he 'll do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He does n't know much about flax, anyhow," muttered old Hayes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He took his punch like a man," said Brierley, bearing testimony on a
      point where his evidence was sure to have weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll do!" said Father Neal once more, and still more authoritatively
      than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Joe carried away every premium from him," said old Nelligan, with a
      degree of irritation that proclaimed how little he enjoyed the priest's
      eulogy of his guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know he did, sir; and no man has a higher respect for your son's great
      abilities than myself; but here 's how it is, Mr. Nelligan,"&mdash;and he
      drew himself up like a man about to deliver a profound opinion,&mdash;"here
      's how it is. The mind that can master abstract science is one thing; the
      faculties that can deal with fellow-mortals is another. This world is not
      a University!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Lord be praised for that same!" cried old Hayes, "or I 'm afraid I 'd
      fare badly in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To unite both descriptions of talent," resumed the priest, oratorically,
      "is the gift of but few."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My 'august leader' has them," broke in Magennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Show me the man that can deal with men!" said Father Neal, dictatorially.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Women is twice as hard to deal with!" cried old Hayes. "I 'll back Nancy
      Drake against any man in the barony."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, and I remember her a pretty woman," said Brierley, who would
      gladly have enticed the conversation out of its graver character. "A
      prettier girl than Mary Martin herself!" continued the inexorable
      Brierley, for the company did not appear to approve of his diversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are now discussing politics,&mdash;grave questions of state, sir,"
      said Father Neal,&mdash;"for we have come to times when even the most
      indifferent and insignificant amongst us cannot refrain feeling an
      interest in the progress of our country. And when I see a fine young man
      like that there, as one may say going a-begging for a party, I tell you
      that we are fools&mdash;worse than fools&mdash;if we don't secure him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean for the borough?" asked Nelligan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, sir,&mdash;I mean for the borough!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not till we have consulted my 'august leader,' I hope," broke in
      Magennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm for managing our own affairs ourselves," said the priest. "What we
      want is a man of our own; and if that young gentleman there will take the
      pledges we should propose, I don't know that we'd readily get the like of
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence that now fell upon the party was ominous; it was plain that
      either the priest's proposition was not fully acquiesced in, or that the
      mode of announcing it was too abrupt. Perhaps this latter appeared the
      case to his own eyes, for he was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course what I have said now is strictly among ourselves, and not to be
      mentioned outside of this room; for until my friend Dan Nelligan here
      consents to take the field against the Martin interest, there is no chance
      of opening the borough. Let him once agree to <i>that</i>, and the member
      for Oughterard will be his own nominee."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really think so?" asked Nelligan, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it, sir; and every gentleman at this table knows it."
    </p>
    <p>
      A strong chorus in assent murmured around the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be a great struggle," muttered Nelligan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a great victory!" said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a deal of money, too, it would cost!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have the money, Dan Nelligan; and let me tell you one thing,"&mdash;here
      he leaned over his chair and whispered some words in the other's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Nelligan's face flushed as he listened, and his eyes sparkled with
      intense excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I thought <i>that</i>&mdash;if I only thought that, Father Rafferty&mdash;I
      'd spend half my fortune on it to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's as true as I'm a living man," said the priest, solemnly; and then
      with a motion of his hand gestured caution, for Massingbred was slowly
      ascending the steps, and about to enter the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an instinctive readiness all his own, he saw in the embarrassed and
      conscious looks around that he had himself been the object of their
      discussion, and with the same shrewdness he detected their favorable
      feeling towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have made them my own!" muttered he to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He 'll do our work well!" said the priest in his heart.

      CHAPTER XI. YOUNG NELLIGAN, AS INTERPRETED IN TWO WAYS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I rather like that young Nelligan," said Martin, the day after Joseph had
      made his first appearance at dinner. "He talks pleasantly, and nothing of
      a pedant, as I half dreaded he might be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought his manner respectful, and very proper for his station," said
      Lady Dorothea, with an air of dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He spoke of politics, too, with less of prejudice, less of class
      bitterness, than I could have expected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some policy, perhaps, in that," remarked her Ladyship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly!" said Martin, with a careless shrug of the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was in a measure on his trial amongst us, and felt the importance of
      making a favorable first impression."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was more trouble than his father would have taken, then," said Martin,
      smiling. "Old Dan, as they call him, is not a very conciliating
      personage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot imagine that the disposition of such a person is a matter of
      much moment. Does n't the man deal in tea, candles, and such like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That he does, and in loans, and in mortgages, too; not to add that he
      exercises a very considerable share of influence in his town of
      Oughterard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very shocking feature of the time we live in!" exclaimed Lady Dorothea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it may be; but there it is,&mdash;just like the wet weather, and the
      typhus, and the sheep-rot, and fifty other disagreeable things one can't
      help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But at least they can avoid recurring to them in conversation, sir. There
      is no necessity to open the window when the look-out is a dreary one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin made no reply, and a pause of some moments ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What arrangement did you come to with him about his party in the
      borough?" said she at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't even allude to the topic," replied he, half testily. "These
      things are not to be done in that hasty fashion; they require management,
      discretion, and a fitting opportunity, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you talk of your grocer's boy as if he were a Cabinet Minister, Mr.
      Martin; you treat him like a great diplomatist!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not exactly on the first occasion of his being in my house that I
      could have broached the matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which implies that you mean to invite him again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly!" was the abrupt rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And must the odious attorney always be of the party?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, madam, the odious attorney has set out for Dublin; but I shortly
      expect here one whom your Ladyship will, doubtless, call an odious lawyer,&mdash;though
      he happens to be one of the foremost men of the Irish bar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A class I detest," said her Ladyship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has one consolation, at least, madam," said Martin; "he figures in a
      pretty long category."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why should he not, sir? What have I ever met in the dreary eighteen
      years and seven months I have passed here, except unmitigated
      self-conceit, vulgarity, and presumption,&mdash;the very type of all three
      being your Dublin barrister."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Their countrymen certainly entertain another estimate of them," said
      Martin, laughing, for he had a lazy man's enjoyment of any passionate
      excitement of another's temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it was," resumed she, "in some sort the contrast presented to such
      which pleased me in that young man's manner yesterday. Not but I feel
      assured that erelong you and Miss Martin will spoil him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I! aunt?" said Mary, looking up from her work; "how am I to exercise the
      evil influence you speak of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the notice&mdash;the interest you vouchsafe him, Miss Martin,&mdash;the
      most flattering compliment to one in his station."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he bears collegiate honors so meekly, aunt," said Mary, quietly,
      "don't you think his head might sustain itself under <i>my</i>
      attentions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly so, young lady, if not accompanied by the accessories of your
      rank in life," said Lady Dorothea, haughtily; "and as to college honors,"
      added she, after a pause, "they are like school distinctions, of no
      earthly value out of the class-room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, I don't know that," said Martin. "At least, in my own experience,
      I can say, every fellow that has made a figure in life gave indications of
      high ability in his college years. I could go over the names of at least a
      dozen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray don't, sir,&mdash;spare your memory, and spare us. Miss Martin and I
      will take it for granted that this young man is destined to be Lord
      Chancellor,&mdash;Ambassador at St. Petersburg,&mdash;or anything else you
      please. I have no doubt that the time is approaching when such things are
      very possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has come already, my Lady," said Martin; and in the manner he uttered
      the words there was no saying whether the sentiment was pleasurable or the
      reverse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet I trust that there is a little interval still left to us ere that
      consummation," said she, with pretentious dignity. "Birth and blood have
      not lost all their <i>prestige!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But they soon would," said Mary, "if they feared to enter the lists
      against those less well-born than themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Martin!" exclaimed her Ladyship, "what words are these?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope they are void of offence, aunt. Assuredly I never conceived that I
      could wound any susceptibilities here by saying that the well-born are
      ready to meet the plebeian on any ground."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no necessity for such trials, Miss Martin; the position of each
      has been so accurately defined by&mdash;by&mdash;by Providence," said she,
      at last, blushing slightly as she uttered the word, "that the contest is
      almost impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The French Revolution reveals another story, aunt, and tells us, besides,
      how inferior were the nobles of that country in the day of struggle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word, these are very pretty notions, young lady. Have they been
      derived from the intelligent columns of the "Galway Monitor," or are they
      the teachings of the gifted Mr. Scanlan? Assuredly, Mr. Martin," said she,
      turning to him, "papa was right, when he said that the Irish nature was
      essentially rebellious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Complimentary, certainly," said Martin, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He founded the remark on history. Papa was uncommonly well read, and used
      to observe that there seemed something in the Celtic nature incompatible
      with that high-souled, chivalrous loyalty Englishmen exhibit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how much of the Celt have Mary and myself got in us, if your
      observation is meant for us? Why, my Lady, what with intermarriage
      centuries ago, and change of blood ever since, the distinctive element has
      been utterly lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet we are not English, uncle," said Mary, with something that
      smacked of pride. "Confess it: we have our nationality, and that our
      people have traits of their own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That they have; but I never heard them made matter of boastfulness
      before," said Lady Dorothea, sneeringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, aunt, it is not too late to hear it now; and I, for one, am proud
      of my country,&mdash;not of its political station, for it is dependent,&mdash;not
      of its wealth, for it is poor,&mdash;but of its genial courtesy, its
      free-hearted hospitality, its manly patience under many a crushing
      calamity, and not least of all, its gallantry on every field where England
      has won honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have read of all these things; but my own experiences are limited to
      the rags and restlessness of a semi-barbarous people. Nay, Miss Martin,
      I'm not going to discuss the matter. I have lived elsewhere,&mdash;you
      have not. I have acquired habits&mdash;prejudices, perhaps you 'd call
      them&mdash;in behalf of twenty things that Irish civilization sees no need
      of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would it not be kind, aunt, were you to aid us by the light of these same
      experiences?" said Mary, with an air of well-assumed humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not, at the price of intercourse with the natives!" exclaimed
      her Ladyship, haughtily. "I detest, on principle, the Lady Bountiful
      character. The whole of the hymn-book, castor-oil, and patent-barley
      sympathy is shockingly vulgar. Like many things, well done at first, it
      fell into low hands, and got spoiled."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone of sarcasm in which this was spoken made Mary's cheeks crimson,
      and the flush spread itself over her neck. Still she made no reply, but
      bending down her head, continued to work more assiduously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When are we to leave this place, Mr. Martin?" asked her Ladyship,
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe we are only waiting here till it be your pleasure to quit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I dying to get away this fortnight past! Some one certainly told me
      that Cro' Martin was not ready for us. Was it <i>you</i>, Miss Martin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, aunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It ran in my head it was you, then. Well, can we go at once&mdash;to-day&mdash;this
      afternoon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow we might, perhaps," said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scarcely so," said Martin, interposing, "seeing that I have asked Repton
      to come down here and see the place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you can drive him over from Cro' Martin. It would be intolerable, the
      idea of remaining here just for him. So we shall go to-morrow, Miss
      Martin." And with this, uttered in the tone of an order, her Ladyship
      swept proudly out of the room, from which Martin, not overanxious for a <i>tête-à-tête</i>
      with his niece, stepped noiselessly at the same moment by another door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had the door closed behind Lady Dorothea, when it was reopened to
      admit Joe Nelligan, who had met her Ladyship in the corridor and been
      received with such palpable coldness of manner that he entered the room
      bashful and awkward, and hardly knowing whether to advance or retire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear I have made my visit at an untimely hour, Miss Martin," said he,
      blushing; "but the truth is, I know next to nothing of society and its
      habits, and if you would only be kind enough to tell me when I am a
      transgressor&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The notion of learning from <i>me</i> is perfect," said Mary,
      interrupting him with a pleasant laugh. "Why, Mr. Nelli-gan, I never could
      be taught anything, even of the most ordinary rules of ceremonial life!
      though," added she, slyly, "I have lived certainly in the midst of great
      opportunities."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then, I have not," said Nelligan, gravely, and accepting the speech
      in all seriousness. "Well, it comes pretty much to the same thing," said
      she, smiling, "since I have profited so little by them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came thus early, however," said he, earnestly, "because I was impatient
      to correct an impression which might have remained from something that
      fell from me last night. You smile, I perceive," said he, "that I should
      attach so much importance to my own words!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not at that I smiled," said Mary, archly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter," continued he. "It is better, at the cost of a little wounded
      vanity, that I should escape a misconception. When your uncle spoke to me,
      last night, about the division of parties in the borough&mdash;You are
      smiling again, Miss Martin!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you perceive, sir, that what amuses me is the mistaken estimate you
      have formed of me, by addressing me on such topics?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I came here expressly to speak to you," said he, with increased
      eagerness; "for I have always heard&mdash;always understood&mdash;that
      none ever took a deeper interest in all that regarded the country than
      yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you mean, by the country, the lives and fortunes of those who live in
      it,&mdash;the people by whose toil it is fertilized, by whose traits it is
      a nation,&mdash;I tell you frankly that I yield to none for interest in
      all that touches them; but if you come to talk of privileges and
      legislative benefits, I know nothing of them: they form a land of whose
      very geography I am ignorant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the subject is the same, and the mind which comprehends one could
      embrace the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the one, however, I can labor usefully and fittingly, without much
      risk of mistake,&mdash;never, indeed, of any mistake that might prove of
      serious moment. The other involves great questions, and has great hazards,
      perils, to affright stronger heads than mine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is much in what you say," said he, reflectingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is far more than I am able to express," said she, warmly. "Just
      remember, for a moment, that of all the laws you great and wise men are
      making, over which you rant and wrangle, and assail each other so
      vindictively, how few ever touch the interests or descend to the fortunes
      of those for whom you assume to make them,&mdash;that the craftiest
      devices of your legislation never uproot ah old prejudice nor disturb an
      antiquated superstition; while I, and such as I,&mdash;and there need be
      nothing more humble,&mdash;can by a little timely help in trouble&mdash;a
      little care, or even a little counsel&mdash;comfort many a failing heart,
      cheer up many a sinking spirit, and, better still, do good service by
      teaching the poor man that he is of one family with those better off than
      himself, and that he is not an outcast because he is lowly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mary went on, her eyes shone more brilliantly, and her cheeks glowed,
      till Nelligan forgot even the words she spoke in admiration of the
      speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But here comes my uncle," cried she, hastily, "to rescue you from further
      amplification of the theme. Come in, uncle,"&mdash;for Martin was already
      about to retire,&mdash;"it is Mr. Nelligan, who wants to speak to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I was in terror of a regular morning visitor!" said Martin, shaking
      the young man's hand cordially. "They didn't tell me you were here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came, sir," said Joseph, hesitatingly, "to rectify what might, perhaps,
      require correction in an observation I made last night. We were talking
      about the proper basis of a representation&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear boy," broke in Martin, laughingly, "there's nothing kills me like
      asking me to go over the past, either in reading an old letter or
      recalling an old conversation. And as to calling on me to justify
      something I once defended in argument, I 'd give up the cause at once, and
      say I was all wrong, in preference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I need not fear you will hold me responsible&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not for anything, except your pledge to dine here tomorrow at seven."
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding all the ease and frankness of Martin's manner&mdash;and as
      manner it was perfect&mdash;the young man felt far from satisfied. His
      want of breeding&mdash;that cruel want strong enough to mar the promise of
      high ability, and even impair the excellence of many a noble nature&mdash;seemed
      to hold him fast bound to the object of his visit. He had come for an
      explanation, and he couldn't go away without it. Mary read his difficulty
      at once, and as she passed him to leave the room, said in a low voice,
      "To-morrow evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nelligan started at the words, and his face became scarlet. What could she
      have meant? Was it that she wished him to come, and had thus condescended
      to remind him of his promise? or was it to suggest a more fitting moment
      to return to the late discussion?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you coming to luncheon, Nelligan?" said Martin, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir; not to-day. I have a call&mdash;a visit&mdash;some miles off."
      And while he was yet stammering out his excuses, Martin waved a familiar
      good-bye with his hand, and passed into the adjoining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what can this mean?" said Nelligan to himself. "Is this the cordial
      treatment of an intimate, or is it contemptuous indifference for an
      inferior?" And, far more puzzled than he should have been with the
      knottiest problem of the "Principia," he quitted the house and strolled
      homewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      His way led along the shore, and consequently in front of that straggling
      row of cottages which formed the village. It chanced to be the last day of
      the month, and, by the decree of the almanac, the close of the
      bathing-season. The scene then going forward was one of unusual and not
      unpicturesque confusion. It was a general break-up of the encampment, and
      all were preparing to depart to their homes, inland. Had young Nelligan
      been&mdash;what he was not&mdash;anything of a humorist, he might have
      been amused at the variety of equipage and costume around him. Conveyances
      the most cumbrous and most rickety, drawn by farm horses, or even donkeys,
      stopped the way before each door, all in process of loading by a strangely
      attired assemblage, whose Welsh wigs, flannel dressing-gowns, and woollen
      nightcaps showed how, by a common consent, all had agreed to merge
      personal vanity in the emergency of the moment. The innumerable little
      concealments which had sheltered many a narrow household, the various
      little stratagems that had eked out many a scanty wardrobe, were now
      abandoned with a noble sincerity; and had there been a cork leg or a glass
      eye in the company, it would not have shrunk from the gaze of that
      open-hearted community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such of the travellers as had taken their places were already surrounded
      with the strangest medley of household gods it is possible to conceive.
      Like trophies, bird-cages, candlesticks, spits, cullenders, fenders, and
      bread-baskets bristled around them, making one marvel how they ever got
      in, or, still more, how they were ever to get out again; the croaking of
      invalids, with crying children, barking terriers, and scolding owners,
      making a suitable chorus to the confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, amidst all the discomforts of the moment, amidst the last
      wranglings with landlords, and the last squabbles over broken furniture
      and missing movables, it must be owned that the prevailing temper of the
      scene was good-humor and jollity. The Irish temperament seems ever to
      discover something congenial in those incidents of confusion and bustle
      which to other people are seasons of unmitigated misery, and even out of
      its own sources of discomfiture can derive matter for that quaint humor
      with which it can always regard life. In this wise was it that few now
      dwelt much upon their own inconveniences, so long as they were free to
      laugh at those of their neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he was well aware of it, young Nelligan found himself in the very
      midst of this gathering, whose mirthful accents suddenly subsided at his
      approach, and an air of constraint and reserve seemed to take their place.
      Never very quick to appreciate such indications, he drew nigh to a very
      lofty "conveniency" in which, with an air of stately dignity, Mrs. Cronan
      sat enthroned on a backgammon-table, with a portentous-looking cap-case in
      her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother will be sorry not to have seen you before you went away, Mrs.
      Cronan," said he to that lady, whose demure and frigid demeanor made the
      speech sound like a bold one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'd have left my card and my compliments, sir, if I wasn't so pressed
      for time," responded she, with a haughty gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With P. P. C. on the corner," said the Captain from his pony-gig
      alongside; "which means, pour prendre 'congo,' or 'congee,' I never knew
      which."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She 'll be very lonely now, for the few days we remain," resumed Joe,
      conscious of some awkwardness, without knowing where or how.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not with the society of your distinguished acquaintances at 'The Nest,'
      sir!" the sarcastic import of which reply was more in the manner than the
      mere words; while the old Captain murmured,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begad, she gave it to him there,&mdash;a regular double-headed shot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We hope to follow you by the end of the week," said Nelligan, trying to
      seem at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you can tear yourselves away, I suppose," said Miss Busk, through a
      double veil of blue gauze; for that lady's auburn ringlets reposed at the
      moment in the small mahogany casket beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is not much attraction in the spot just now," said Joseph, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not for the like of us, perhaps, sir," retorted Mrs. Cronan,&mdash;"not
      for persons in our station; but your fashionable people, I believe, always
      prefer a place when the vulgar company have left it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good again,&mdash;grape and canister!" chuckled out the Captain, who
      seemed to derive a high enjoyment from the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you move a little to one side, Mr. Nelligan?" said the doctor; "my
      pony won't stand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he's mettlesome," said Joe, good-humoredly, as he stepped out of the
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That he is, sir, though he never was leader in a four-in-hand; but, you
      see, poor creatures of quadrupeds forget themselves down here, just like
      their betters!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And the success of this sally was acknowledged by a general laugh from the
      company. The tone of the speakers, even more than their words, convinced
      Joseph that, from some cause or other, he was the object of their
      sarcasms; and although slow to take offence,&mdash;even to the verge of
      what many might have called an unfeeling indifference,&mdash;he felt their
      treatment most acutely. It was, then, in something like a haughty defiance
      that he wished them a careless good-bye, and continued his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The world seems bent on puzzling me this morning," muttered he, as he
      sauntered slowly on. "People treat me as though I were playing some deep
      game to their detriment,&mdash;I, who have no game, almost no future!"
      added he, despondingly. "For what avails it to attain eminence amidst such
      as these; and, as for the others, I was not born for them."
    </p>
    <p>
      To these moody thoughts succeeded others still gloomier. It had only been
      within a short time back that the young man had begun to appreciate the
      difficulties of a position to which his early successes imparted
      increasing embarrassment; and darkly brooding over these things, he drew
      near his mother's cottage. She was already at the door to meet him, with a
      letter in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is from your father, Joe," said she. "He wants you in all haste up
      at the town; and I've packed your clothes, and sent off Patsey for
      Mooney's car; so come in and eat something at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph took the note from her hand and perused it in silence. It was
      brief, and ran thus:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Dear Joe,&mdash;I want you up here as soon as possible, to meet
     a friend whom you 'll be surprised to see. I say no more,
     but that I expect you by dinner-time.&mdash;Yours ever,

     "D.N."
</pre>
    <p>
      "What does that mean, Joe?" asked his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      He only shrugged his shoulders in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who can it be?" said she again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some of the townspeople, of course," said he, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, Joe; it must be a stranger. Maybe it's Morgan Drake; his aunt
      expected him back from Jamaica before Christmas. Or it 's Corny Dwyer 's
      come home from Africa; you know he went on the deploring expedition&mdash;"
      "Exploring, mother,&mdash;exploring."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, exploring or deploring, it's all the same. He went four years ago,
      and all the tidings they 've had of him was an elephant's tooth he sent
      home to his stepfather. I know it's Corny, for your father always liked
      him and the funny stories he told."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps so!" replied Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder, is he grown any bigger? He was little better than a dwarf when
      he went away, and the same age as yourself. No, indeed, he was older,&mdash;fourteen
      months older. It was Catty Henderson was running in my head. Is n't she a
      fine young woman, Joe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remarkably so," said he, with more animation in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little bit too haughty-looking and proud, maybe, considering her
      station in life, and that she has to go to service&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go to service, mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure she has. If they can't get her a place as a governess or a
      companion, she 'll have to take what she can get. Her father's married
      again, my dear Joe; and when men do that!" And here Mrs. Nelligan uplifted
      her hands and eyes most expressively. "Ay, indeed," continued she, with a
      heavy sigh, "and if it was once it was fifty times, Catty's poor mother
      said to me, 'Sarah,' says she,&mdash;she never called me Sally, but always
      Sarah,&mdash;'Sarah,' says she, 'I 've but one comfort, and that is that
      Catty will never want a mother while you live. You 'll be the same to her
      as myself,&mdash;just as fond, and just as forgiving;' them was her very
      words!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I hope you have never forgotten them, mother?" said Joe, with
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you see I have n't; an't I repeating them to you this minute?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but I mean the spirit and the meaning of them," rejoined he, "and
      that you feel the obligation they 've laid upon you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure I feel it; don't I fret over it every time I 'm alone? for I
      can't get it out of my head that maybe she 'd appear to me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but her mother. Oh, it 's nothing to laugh at, Joe. There was Eliza
      Keane came back every Easter Monday for two-and-twenty years to search for
      a gravy-spoon. Well, if it's laughing you are, I won't say any more; but
      here 's the car now, and it's late enough we 'll be on the road!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not thinking of going, mother. I never meant to go," said Joe,
      resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never meant to go, after your father's note to you, Joe?" cried she, in
      half horror. "Surely it's all as one as ordering you up there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know all that," said he, calmly; "but I see no reason why I should
      forego the pleasure of a party at the Martins' for the sake of meeting the
      convivial celebrities of Oughterard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what will you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say I'm engaged; have accepted another invitation; or, better still,
      leave you to make my excuses, mother. Come, come, don't look so terribly
      shocked and terrified. You know well enough that my father's four-year-old
      mutton and his crusted port will compensate the company for heavier
      inflictions than my absence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They were always fond of you, Joe," said Mrs. Nelligan, half
      reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing of the kind, mother; they never cared for me, nor was there any
      reason why they should. I 'm sure I never cared for them. We endured one
      another; that was all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear; but I 'm glad your father is not listening to you," said she,
      with a stealthy glance around, as though not perfectly assured of secrecy.
      "So, then, I suppose, there 's nothing for it but to go up myself and make
      the best of it; and sure it's all a lottery what temper he 's in, and how
      he 'll take it. I remember when they put the new duty on&mdash;what was
      it, Joe? I think it was hides&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not the least matter, mother; you 've only to say that Mr. Martin has
      been kind enough to show me some attentions, and that I am silly enough&mdash;if
      you like to say so&mdash;to prefer them to the festive pleasures of
      Oughterard. In another week or so I shall have to go back to college. Let
      me, at least, enjoy the few days of my vacation in my own fashion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Nelligan shook her head mournfully over these signs of rebellion, and
      muttering many a gloomy foreboding, she went off to her room to make her
      preparations for the journey.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. A VERY "CROSS EXAMINATION"
    </h2>
    <p>
      The morning was bright and sunny, the air sharp, crisp, and bracing, as
      the heavy travelling-carriage which conveyed Mr. Martin and Lady Dorothea
      rolled smoothly along the trimly kept approach to Cro' Martin. Many a
      beautiful glade, many a lovely vista opened on them as they passed along
      deep-bosomed woods and gently swelling slopes, dotted over with cattle,
      stretched away on either side; while far in the distance could be seen the
      battlemented towers of the princely residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lover of nature might have felt intense pleasure at a scene so
      abounding in objects of beauty. A painter would have lingered with delight
      over effects of light and shade, glorious displays of color, and graceful
      groupings of rocks and trees and gnarled stumps. A proud man might have
      exulted in the selfish enjoyment of feeling that these were all his own;
      while a benevolent one would have revelled in the thought of all the
      channels through which such wealth might carry the blessings of aid and
      charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which of these feelings predominated now in the minds of those who, snugly
      encased in furs, occupied the respective corners of the ample coach? Shall
      we own it? Not any of them. A dreamy, unremarking indifference was the
      sentiment of each; and they sat silently gazing on a prospect which
      suggested nothing, nor awoke one passing emotion in their hearts. Had any
      one been there to express his admiration of the landscape,&mdash;praised
      the trees, the cattle, or the grassy slopes,&mdash;Martin might have heard
      him with pleasure, and listened even with interest to his description. My
      Lady, too, might not unwillingly have lent an ear to some flattery of the
      splendid demesne of which she was mistress, and accepted as half homage
      the eulogy of what was hers. None such was, however, there; and so they
      journeyed along, as seemingly unconscious as though the scene were wrapped
      in midnight darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin had known the spot, and every detail of it, from his boyhood. The
      timber, indeed, had greatly grown,&mdash;graceful saplings had become
      stately trees, and feathery foliage deepened into leafy shade; but he
      himself had grown older, too, and his sense of enjoyment, dulled and
      deadened with years, saw nothing in the scene to awaken pleasure. As for
      Lady Dorothea, she had reasoned herself into the notion that the walls of
      her own grounds were the boundaries of a prison, and had long convinced
      herself that she was a suffering martyr to some mysterious sense of duty.
      From the drowsy languor in which they reclined they were both aroused, as
      the pace of the carriage gradually diminished from a smooth brisk trot to
      an uneven jolting motion, the very reverse of agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have they done? Where are they going?" said Lady Dorothea,
      peevishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Martin called out from the window, in tones even less gentle. "Oh,
      it's the new approach; the road is not quite completed," said he, half
      sulkily, as he resumed his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another of Miss Martin's clever devices, which, I must say, I never
      concurred in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you always professed to hate the old road by the stables."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I did; but I never agreed to passing round the back of the house, and
      thus destroying the privacy of the flower-garden,&mdash;the only spot I
      may dare to call my own. Oh, dear! I shall be shaken to death. Have they
      broken the carriage? I 'm certain they 've smashed the spring at my side!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin gave a cold, supercilious smile, the only reply to these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They 've only broken a trace, I perceive," said he, casting a hurried
      glance through the window, as the carriage came to a dead stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are equanimity itself, sir, this morning," said her Ladyship, in a
      voice almost tremulous with anger. "I wonder if this admirable temper will
      befriend you when you shall see the cost of this precious piece of
      road-making?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It employs the people," said he, coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Employs the people! How I hate that cant phrase! Can't they employ
      themselves on their own farms? Have n't they digging and draining, and
      whatever it is, to do of their own? Must they of necessity depend on us
      for support, and require that we should institute useless works to employ
      them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As if to offer a living commentary on her speech, a number of half-fed and
      less than half-clad men now drew near, and in accents of a most servile
      entreaty begged to offer their services. Some, indeed, had already busied
      themselves to repair the broken harness, and others were levelling the
      road, carrying stones to fill up holes, and in every possible manner
      endeavoring to render assistance; but all were vociferous in asserting
      that the delay would not be above a minute or two; that the road was an
      elegant one, or would be soon, and that it was a "raal blessing" to see
      her Ladyship and the master looking so well. In fact, they were thankful
      and hopeful together; and, notwithstanding the evidences of the deepest
      destitution in their appearance, they wore an air of easy, jaunty
      politeness, such as many a professional diner-out might have envied. Lady
      Dorothea was in no mood to appreciate such traits; indeed, if the truth
      must be told, they rather ruffled than soothed her. Martin saw nothing in
      them; he was too much accustomed to the people to be struck with any of
      their peculiarities, and so he lay back in silent apathy, and took no
      notice of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all their alacrity and all their good-will&mdash;and there was no
      lack of either&mdash;there was yet such a total absence of all system and
      order, that their efforts were utterly useless. Some tugged away manfully
      to raise stones too heavy to lift; others came rudely in contact with
      fellows heavily laden, and upset them. The sturdy arms that spoked the
      hind wheels were resolutely antagonized by as vigorous struggles to move
      the fore ones. Every one shouted, cried, cursed, and laughed, by turns;
      and a more hopeless scene of confusion and uproar need not be conceived.
      Nor was Lady Dorothea herself an inactive spectator; for, with her head
      from the carriage-window, she directed a hundred impossible measures, and
      sat down at last, overcome with rage and mortification at their blunders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tumult was now at the highest, and the horses, terrified by the noise
      around them, had commenced plunging and rearing fearfully, when Mary
      Martin came galloping up to the spot at full speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let go that bridle, Hogan," cried she, aloud; "you are driving that horse
      mad. Loose the leaders' traces; unbuckle the reins, Patsey; the wheelers
      will stand quietly. There, lead them away. Speak to that mare; she 's
      trembling with fear. I told you not to come by this road, Barney; and it
      was only by accident that I saw the wheel-tracks. A thousand pardons, Aunt
      Dora, for this mishap. Barney misunderstood my orders. It will be all
      right in a moment. Once over this bad spot, the road is hard and level."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Having no taste, nor any genius for adventures, Miss Martin," began her
      Ladyship&mdash;But Mary did not await the remainder of the speech; for,
      turning her horse sharply round, and beckoning to some of the people to
      follow her, she was away across the lawn at a smart canter. Having arrived
      at a small wooden bridge over a river, she ordered the men to lift some of
      the planking, by the aid of which they soon constructed a firm and safe
      passage for the carriage; and as her presence was the signal for quiet
      obedience and prompt action, in less than ten minutes the difficulty was
      surmounted, the horses reharnessed, and all in readiness to proceed on
      their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin looked on in silent satisfaction, not offering a single suggestion,
      or even seeming to feel interested in the events, but enjoying, with all a
      lazy man's pleasure, the activity displayed around him. Not so Lady
      Dorothea. If she did not like "an adventure," she loved "a grievance."
      Whatever ministered to her selfishness, even in the remotest degree, was
      grateful to her. Mary's opportune arrival had now converted what might
      have passed for a calamity into a mere momentary inconvenience; and she
      could not conceal her discontent. "Your heroines are a perfect torment; at
      least, to us souls of commoner clay. They live only for disasters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must say that Mary extricated us from what might have become one," said
      Martin, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are indebted to her, however, for the possibility. This detestable
      road, which I promise you I 'll never come again, is entirely her own
      invention. I hope, Miss Martin," added she, from the window, "that the
      other approach is to be kept in repair,&mdash;at least, for me." But Mary
      did not hear the appeal, for she was bandaging the arm of a poor country
      fellow, who had been sorely cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, drive on, Barney," cried Lady Dorothea. "I shall be taken ill if I
      stay here. Really, Mr. Martin, your niece's accomplishments are the least
      feminine one can conceive." And improving this theme, she continued the
      entire way till the carriage drew up at the door of the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," said she, as she descended, "that heavy sigh shows you are
      indeed greatly to be pitied. No martyrdom ever exceeded yours. I am quite
      aware of all my imperfections, and can at least fancy everything you could
      say of me and my temper. What did you say, Collins?" said she, addressing
      the obsequious-looking servant, who, with an air of gloomy joy, very
      respectful,&mdash;but meant to mean more,&mdash;had whispered something in
      her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A young lady, did you say, Collins?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my Lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you were very wrong, Collins. You meant to say a young person."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my Lady,&mdash;a young person, like a lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in the least, except to such appreciation as yours. Where is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In your Ladyship's library."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did she come alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my Lady. Mr. Henderson drove her over in his car, and said he 'd pass
      this way again in the evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      And now her Ladyship swept proudly by, scarcely noticing the bowing
      servants who had formed into a line along the hall, and who endeavored to
      throw into their sorrowful faces as much of joy as might consist with the
      very deepest humility. Nor was she more condescending to old Catty, who
      stood courtesying at the top of the stairs, with a basket of keys on her
      arm that might have served to lock up all Newgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How cold every place feels! Collins, are you sure the rooms are properly
      aired?" cried she, shuddering. "But I suppose it's the climate. Have
      another stove put there," said she, pointing to an impossible locality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my Lady," replied Collins.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And warmer carpets on these passages."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my Lady; it shall be done to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir; to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my Lady; this afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't remember if the windows are double along here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my Lady, they are all double towards the north."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then they fit badly, for I feel the draught acutely here. It's like the
      keen air of a mountain;" and Collins gave a slight sympathetic shudder,
      and really looked cold. A somewhat haughty glance from her Ladyship,
      however, as quickly reproved him, for Collins ought to have known that it
      was not by such as himself changes of temperature could be appreciable.
      And now she passed on and entered that part of the mansion peculiarly her
      own, and where, it must be owned, her spirit of fault-finding would have
      been at a loss what to condemn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Dorothea's library occupied an angle of the building; and from this
      circumstance, included within its precincts an octagonal tower, the view
      from which comprised every varied character of landscape. This favored
      spot was fitted up in the most luxurious taste,&mdash;with rarest gems of
      art, and cabinet pictures of almost fabulous value,&mdash;to supply which
      foreign dealers and connoisseurs had been for years back in correspondence
      with her Ladyship. Now it was some rare treasure of carved ivory, or some
      sculptured cup of Benvenuto, that had been discovered accidentally, and
      which, despite the emulous zeal of princes and cardinals to obtain, was
      destined for herself. Now it was some choice mosaic of which but one other
      specimen existed, and that in the Pope's private collection at the
      Quirinal. Such was her ardor in this pursuit of excellence, that more than
      once had every object of this precious chamber been changed, to give place
      to something more costly, more precious, and rarer. For about two years
      back, however, the resources of the old world seemed to offer nothing
      worthy of attention, and the vases, the "statuettes," the bronzes, the
      pictures, and medallions had held their ground undisturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the sanctity of this spot, that in showing the house to strangers
      it was never opened, nor, without a special order from Lady Dorothea,&mdash;a
      favor somewhat more difficult to obtain than a firman from the Sultan,&mdash;could
      any one be admitted within its walls. The trusty servant in whose charge
      it was, was actually invested with a species of sacred character in the
      household, as one whose feet had passed the threshold of the tabernacle.
      Our reader may then picture to himself something of Lady Dorothea's varied
      sensations&mdash;for, indeed, they were most mingled&mdash;as she heard a
      slight cough from within the chamber, and, drawing nearer, perceived a
      female figure seated in front of one of the windows, calmly regarding the
      landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a degree of noise and bustle sufficient to announce her approach,
      Lady Dorothea entered the tower; while the stranger, rising, retired one
      step, and courtesied very deeply. There was in all the humility of the
      obeisance a certain degree of graceful dignity that certainly struck her
      Ladyship; and her haughty look and haughtier tone were some little
      modified as she asked by what accident she found her there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My intrusion was a pure accident, my Lady," replied the other, in a low,
      soft voice; "mistaking the door by which I had entered a room, I wandered
      on through one after another until I found myself here. I beg your
      Ladyship to believe that nothing was further from my thoughts than to
      obtrude upon your privacy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your name?" began her Ladyship; and then, as suddenly correcting herself,
      she said, "You are Miss Henderson, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my Lady," she replied, with a slight bend of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sent for you," said Lady Dorothea, in a half-careless tone, while she
      turned over some books on the table, as if in search of something,&mdash;"I
      sent for you, partly at the request of your mother&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My stepmother, my Lady," interposed the girl, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Dorothea stared at her for a second or two, as though to say, how had
      she dared to correct her; but either that the reproof had not met its full
      success, or that she did not care to pursue it, she added, "At the request
      of your friends, and partly out of curiosity." And here Lady Dorothea
      raised her glass to her eye, and quietly surveyed her,&mdash;an
      examination which, it must be owned, none could have borne with more
      unshaken fortitude; not the slightest tremor of a limb, not the faintest
      change of color betokening that the ordeal was a painful one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do see that you have been educated in France," said her Ladyship, with
      a smile of most supercilious import, while a courtesy from the young girl
      admitted the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you brought up in Paris?" asked she, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For four years, my Lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the remainder of the time, where was it passed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We travelled a great deal, my Lady, in Germany and Italy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'We,'&mdash;who were the 'we' you speak of? Please to bear in mind that I
      know nothing of your history."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I forgot that, my Lady. I thought my stepmother had, perhaps, informed
      your Ladyship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of nothing whatever, child," said she, haughtily, "save of your having a
      foreign education, and wishing, or hoping, to find some engagement as a
      governess or a teacher;" and the last words were drawled out languidly, as
      though they were suggestive of all that was wearisome and a bore. "So you
      must be good enough to explain who 'we' were."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Duchesse de Luygnes and her family, my Lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You travelled with them; and in what capacity, pray?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was called companion to the Princesse de Courcelles, the eldest
      daughter of the Duchess, my Lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Companion!&mdash;why, you must have been a mere child at the time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A mere child, my Lady; but they took me from the Pensionnat, to speak
      English with the young Princess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then they took the charge of your education, I conclude?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my Lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And to what extent&mdash;or rather, in what direction; I mean, what
      object had they in view in choosing your studies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They gave me the same masters as to the young Princess, my Lady; and I
      was instructed in all respects as she was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And treated like her also, I conclude?" said Lady Dorothea, with a
      sneering smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame la Duchesse was ever most kind to me," said the girl, half
      proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kind&mdash;yes, of course&mdash;kind, if you conducted yourself properly
      and to her satisfaction. A person of her condition would be kind; but I
      trust this did not proceed so far as to spoil you? I hope it never made
      you forget your station?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust it did not, my Lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With what part of the establishment did you live? Where did you dine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With the Princess, my Lady; except on <i>fête</i> days, when we were
      invited to the table of the Duchess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never heard of anything more absurd,&mdash;outrageously absurd. Why,
      are you aware, young woman, that these same friends of yours have done you
      irreparable mischief? They have, so to say, ruined your entire future; for
      how can I, and others in my station, avail myself of your services, with
      such habits and expectations as these?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not expectations, my Lady. I never did or can expect such
      condescension from another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter; your head is filled with ideas unbefitting your condition,
      usages, habits, associations, all foreign to a menial station. You have
      been admitted to privileges the want of which would be felt as hardships.
      In fact, as I said before, they have done you irreparable injury. You must
      feel it yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      A very faint smile, half in deprecation of the appeal, was the only reply
      of the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are certain to feel it later on in life, if you are not sensible of
      it at present, that I can vouch for, young woman," said Lady Dorothea,
      with all the firmness with which she could utter an unpleasant speech.
      "Nothing but unhappiness ever resulted from such ill-judged indulgence.
      Indeed, if your mother had mentioned the circumstances, I scarcely think I
      should have sent for you"&mdash;she paused to see if any strong signs of
      contrite sorrow displayed themselves in the young girl's features; none
      such were there, and Lady Dorothea more sternly added,&mdash;"I may safely
      say, I never should have asked to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      When a speech meant to be severe has failed to inflict the pain it was
      intended to produce, it invariably recoils with redoubled power upon him
      who uttered it; and so Lady Dorothea now felt all the pang of her own
      ungenerous sentiment. With an effort to shake off this unpleasant
      sensation, she resumed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might go further, and observe that unless you yourself became
      thoroughly penetrated with the fact, you must always prove very unsuitable
      to the station you are destined to occupy in life. Do you understand me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe I do, my Lady," was the calm reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And also," resumed she, still more dictatorially&mdash;"and also, that
      acquiring this knowledge by yourself will be less painful to your feelings
      than if impressed upon you by others. Do you fully apprehend me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so, my Lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, although the tone and manner of the young girl were unexceptionable
      in all that regards deference and respect, Lady Dorothea was not a little
      provoked at her unbroken composure. There was no confusion, not even a
      semblance of constraint about her. She replied to even sarcastic questions
      without the faintest shadow of irritation, and exhibited throughout the
      most perfect quietude and good breeding. Had the "young person" been
      overwhelmed with shame, or betrayed into any access of temper, her
      Ladyship's manner would have presented a pattern of haughty dignity and
      gracefulness, and her rebukes would have been delivered in a tone of
      queen-like superiority; but Miss Henderson afforded no opportunity for
      these great qualities. She was deference itself; but deference so
      self-possessed, so assured of its own safeguard, as to be positively
      provoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Under all these circumstances, therefore," resumed Lady Dorothea, as if
      having revolved mighty thoughts within her mind, "it appears to me you
      would not suit me."
    </p>
    <p>
      But even this speech failed to call up one trait of disappointment, and
      the young girl received it with only a deep courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry for it," continued my Lady, "on your mother's account; your
      education has of course cost her and your father many sacrifices, which
      your duty requires you to repay." She paused, as if asking for some assent
      to this speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another deep courtesy was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, that will do," said Lady Dorothea, angrily; for any attempt to
      provoke seemed an utter failure. "I think I have nothing more to say. When
      I shall see your mother I can explain more fully to her. Good-morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish your Ladyship good-morning," said the girl, with a deep obeisance,
      and in a voice of perfect deference, while she retired towards the door.
      Before she had reached it, however, Lady Dorothea again addressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forgot, I think, to tell me why you left the Duchesse de Luygnes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I left on the marriage of the Princess, my Lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I remember; she married a Russian, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my Lady; she married the Duc de Mirecourt, French Ambassador at St.
      Petersburg."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, to be sure. I knew there was something Russian about it. And so they
      sent you away then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Duchess most kindly invited me to accompany her, my Lady, but my
      father desired I should return to Ireland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And very properly," said Lady Dorothea; "he took a most just view of the
      case; your position would only have exposed you to great perils. I'm sure
      you are not of my opinion, for distrust of yourself does not appear one of
      your failings."&mdash;It is possible that this ungenerous remark was
      evoked by a very slight curl of the young girl's lip, and which, faint as
      it was, did not escape her Ladyship's keen glances.&mdash;"Good-morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again had Miss Henderson gained the door; her hand was already on the
      lock, when her Ladyship called out: "In the event of anything occurring to
      me likely to suit you, I ought to know what you can teach; and mind, don't
      bore me with a mere catalogue of hard names, but say what you really
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some modern languages, my Lady, with music."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No Greek or Latin?" said Lady Dorothea, half sneer-ingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Latin, perhaps; but though I can read some Greek, I could not venture to
      teach it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor Hebrew?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my Lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the modern tongues,&mdash;which of them do you profess to know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "French, Italian, Spanish, and German."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And don't you draw?&mdash;they showed me what they called yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my Lady, but I cannot teach drawing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And of course you are thoroughly versed in history. Have you studied any
      scientific subjects?&mdash;mathematics, for instance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only a few of the French initial books, my Lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you are quite an Admirable Crichton for acquirement. I feel really
      abashed to find myself in such company." But even this coarse speech
      failed to irritate, and Lady Dorothea walked angrily towards the window
      and looked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so chanced that, through an opening of the wood, she caught sight of a
      large assemblage of workpeople, who, headed by Miss Martin on horseback,
      were on their way to the quarries; and as she looked, a sudden thought
      flashed across her: "Why not retain the 'young person' as a companion for
      her niece? How admirably would all this girl's knowledge contrast with
      Mary's ignorance! What an unceasing source of disparagement would their
      contact afford, at the very moment that the arrangement might seem
      dictated by the very best and highest of motives."
    </p>
    <p>
      It may doubtless appear to many, that the individual who could reason thus
      must be animated by a most corrupt and depraved nature, but unhappily the
      spiteful element in the human heart is one which never measures its modes
      of attack, but suffers itself to be led on, from acts of mere petty malice
      to actions of downright baseness and badness. Lady Dorothea was not devoid
      of good traits, but once involved in a pursuit, she totally forgot the
      object which originally suggested it, but engaged all her zeal and all her
      ardor for success. She would have been shocked at the bare possibility of
      actually injuring her niece; she would have resented with indignation the
      mere mention of such; but yet she would have eagerly grasped at whatever
      afforded a chance of dominating over her. Mary's influence in the
      household&mdash;her rule over the peasantry of the estate&mdash;was a
      perpetual source of annoyance to her Ladyship, and yet she never knew how
      to thwart it, till now that chance seemed to offer this means.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You need not go back just yet: I 'll speak to Mr. Martin about you," said
      she, turning towards Miss Henderson; and, with a respectful courtesy, the
      girl withdrew, leaving her Ladyship to her own somewhat complicated
      reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than half an hour after Lady Dorothea proceeded to Mr. Martin's
      study, where a cabinet council was held, the substance of which our reader
      can readily conceive; nor need he have any doubts as to the decision, when
      we say that Lady Dorothea retired to her own room with a look of
      satisfaction so palpably displayed that Mademoiselle Hortense, her maid,
      remarked to herself, "Somebody or other was sure to pass a <i>mauvais
      quart d'heure</i> when <i>miladi</i> goes to her room with an air of such
      triumphant meaning as that."

      CHAPTER XIII. "A HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM"
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cro' Martin was replete with every comfort and luxury. All its
      arrangements betokened wealth; not a single appliance of ease or enjoyment
      but was to be found within its well-ordered walls; and yet there was one
      want which seemed to mar all, and infuse a sense of almost dreary coldness
      over everything, and this was&mdash;the absence of a numerous family, the
      assemblage of various ages, which gives to a home its peculiar interest,
      embodying the hopes and fears and passions and motives of manhood, in
      every stage of existence, making up that little world within doors which
      emblematizes the great one without; but, with this singular advantage, of
      its being bound up in one holy sentiment of mutual love and affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      This charm is it which gives the whole vitality to home,&mdash;this
      mingling of the temperaments of youth and manhood and deep age, blending
      hopes of the future with memories of the past, and making of every heart a
      portion of one human biography, in which many are sharers. To the
      stranger, who came to see the house and its gorgeous decorations, all
      seemed suggestive of habitable enjoyment. The vast drawing-rooms appeared
      as if only waiting for a splendid company; the dark wainscoted
      dining-room, with its noble fireplace of gigantic dimensions, looked the
      very scene where hospitable conviviality might be enacted; the library,
      calm, quiet, and secluded, seemed a spot wherein a student might have
      passed a life long. Even in the views that presented themselves at the
      several windows, there was a certain appropriateness to the character of
      the room, and the same importunate question still arose to one's mind: Who
      is there to enjoy all this? What words of glad welcome echo through this
      vaulted hall, what happy daughter sings through these gilded chambers,
      where is the social pleasantry that circles the blazing fire of the ample
      hearth? Alas! all was sombre, splendid, and dreary. No, we are wrong!&mdash;not
      all! There was one corner of this great house where cheerfulness was the
      very type of comfort. It was a small and not lofty room, whose two windows
      projected beyond the walls, giving a wide view over the swelling landscape
      for miles of space. Here the furniture was of the most ordinary kind, but
      scrupulously neat and well kept. The chairs&mdash;there were but four of
      them&mdash;all with arms and deep cushions; the walnut table a perfect
      mirror of polish; the cloth curtains, that closed the windows and
      concealed the door, massive and heavy-folded,&mdash;all breathed of
      snugness; while the screen that surrounded the fire had other perfections
      than those of comfortable seclusion, containing a most strange collection
      of the caricatures of the time, and the period before the Union. It is but
      necessary to add that this was Mrs. Broon's apartment,&mdash;the snug
      chamber where old Catty enjoyed herself, after the fatigues and duties of
      the day. Here now she sat at tea, beside a cheerful fire, the hissing
      kettle on the hob harmonizing pleasantly with the happy purring of an
      enormous cat, who sat winking at the blaze; and while evidently
      inconvenienced by the heat, lacking energy to retreat from it. Catty had
      just obtained the newspaper,&mdash;as the master had gone to dinner,&mdash;and
      was really about to enjoy a comfortable evening. Far from devoid of social
      qualities, or a liking for companionship, she still lived almost entirely
      to herself, the other servants being chiefly English, whose habits and
      ways were all strange to her, and all whose associations were widely
      different from her own. Catty Broon had thus obtained a reputation for
      unsociability which she by no means deserved, but to which, it must be
      owned, she was totally indifferent. In fact, if <i>they</i> deemed <i>her</i>
      morose and disagreeable, <i>she</i>, in turn, held <i>them</i> still more
      cheaply, calling them a set of lazy devils that "were only in each other's
      way," and "half of them not worth their salt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Catty had also survived her generation; all her friends of former years
      had either died or emigrated, and except two or three of the
      farm-servants, none of the "ould stock," as she called them, were in
      existence. This brief explanation will show that Catty's comparative
      isolation was not entirely a matter of choice. If a sense of loneliness
      did now and then cross her mind, she never suffered it to dwell there, but
      chased away the unpleasant thought by some active duty; or if the season
      of that were over, by the amusing columns of the "Intelligence,"&mdash;a
      journal which realized to Mrs. Broon's conceptions the very highest order
      of literary merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catty did not take much interest in politics; she had a vague, dreamy kind
      of notion that the game of party was a kind of disreputable gambling, and
      Parliament itself little better than a "Hell," frequented by very
      indifferent company. Indeed, she often said it would be "well for us if
      there was no politics, and maybe then, there would be no taxes either."
      The news she liked was the price of farming-stock at fairs and markets,&mdash;what
      Mr. Hynes got for his "top lot" of hoggets, and what Tom Healey paid for
      the "finest heifers ever seen on the fair-green." These, and the accidents&mdash;a
      deeply interesting column&mdash;were her peculiar tastes; and her memory
      was stored with every casualty, by sea, fire, and violence, that had
      graced the "Intelligence" for forty years back; in truth they formed the
      stations of her chronology, and she would refer to events as having
      occurred the same year that Joe Ryan was hanged, or "the very Christmas
      that Hogan fired at Captain Crossley." An inundation of great extent also
      figured in these memorabilia, and was constantly referred to, by her
      saying, "This or that happened the year after the Flood," suggesting a
      rather startling impression as to her longevity.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening we now refer to, the newspaper was more than commonly
      adorned with these incidents. Public news having failed, private
      calamities were invoked to supply the place. Catty was, therefore,
      fortunate. There was something, too, not altogether unpleasant in the
      whistling storm that raged without, and the heavy plashing of the rain as
      it beat upon the window-panes. Without imputing to her, as would be most
      unjust, the slightest touch of ill-nature, she felt a heightened sense of
      her own snugness as she drew closer to the bright hearth, while she read
      of "a dreadful gale in the Bay of Biscay."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just in the most exciting portion of the description that her door
      was rudely opened, and the heavy curtain dashed aside with a daring hand;
      and Catty, startled by the sudden interruption, called angrily out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's there?&mdash;who are ye at all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't you guess, Catty?" cried out a pleasant voice. "Don't you know that
      there's only one in this house here who 'd dare to enter in such a
      fashion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Miss Mary, is it you? And, blessed Virgin, what a state ye 're in!"
      cried she, as she gazed at the young girl, who, throwing away her
      riding-hat, wrung out the rain from her long and silky hair, while she
      laughed merrily at old Catty's dismayed countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, where in the world were you&mdash;what happened you, darling?" said
      Catty, as she assisted her to remove the dripping costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was at the Wood, Catty, and up to the quarries, and round by Cronebawn,
      and then, seeing a storm gathering, I thought I 'd turn homeward, but one
      of Kit Sullivan's children&mdash;my little godchild, you know&mdash;detained
      me to hear him recite some verses he had learned for my birthday; and,
      what with one thing and another, it was pitch dark when I reached the 'New
      Cut,' and then, to my annoyance, I found the bridge had just been carried
      away&mdash;there, Catty, now for a pair of your own comfortable slippers&mdash;and,
      as I was saying to you, there was no bridge!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The bridge gone!" exclaimed Catty, in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All Tom Healey's fault. I told him that the arch had not span enough, and
      that the buttresses would never stand the first heavy fall of rain from
      the mountains, and there 's not a vestige of them now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what did you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I rode for the Low Meadows, Catty, with all speed. I knew that the river,
      not being confined there between narrow banks, and spreading over a wide
      surface, couldn't be very deep. Nor was it. It never touched the girths
      but once, when we got into a hole. But she is such a rare good beast, that
      little Sorrel; she dashed through everything, and I don't think I took
      forty minutes from Kane's Mill to this door, though I never saw a spot of
      the road all the while, except when the lightning showed it. There now,
      like a good old dear, don't wring your hands and say, 'Blessed hour!' but
      just put some more tea in the teapot, and fetch me your brown loaf!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely you 'll die of cold!&mdash;you 'll be in a fever!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, Catty; I have been out in rain before this. I'm more provoked
      about that bridge than all else. My excellent aunt will have such a laugh
      at my engineering skill, when she hears of it. Can't be helped, however.
      And so there's a dinner-party upstairs, I hear. Fanny told me there were
      three strangers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I hear. There's a lawyer from Dublin; and a lady from I don't know
      where; and young Nelligan, old Dan's son. I 'm sure I never thought I 'd
      see the day he 'd be eating his dinner at Cro' Martin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why not, Catty? What is there in his manners and conduct that should
      not make him good company for any one here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is n't he the son of a little huckster in Oughterard? Old Dan, that I
      remember without a shoe to his foot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is it a reproach to him that he has made a fortune by years of
      patient industry and toil?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In-dus-try! toil! indeed," said Catty, sneeringly. "How much in-dus-try
      or toil there is, weighing out snuff and sugar in a snug shop. Ayeh! he's
      an old nig-gar, the same Dan. I know him well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that is no reason why you should disparage his son, Catty, who is a
      young gentleman of the highest ability and great promise. I never heard
      you speak so ungenerously before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, darling, don't look angry with your ould Catty, anyway. It
      isn't for the like of Dan Nelligan, or his son either, you'd be cross with
      <i>me!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, Catty, never,&mdash;for anybody or anything," said the young girl,
      taking her hand with both her own. "But you have n't told me who the lady
      is. How did she arrive, and when?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know nothing of her. Peter came to say that the blue bedroom was
      wanting to-night, and he wished to torment me into asking who for?&mdash;but
      I wouldn't, just for that same; and so I gave him the keys without a
      word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if this note, that I found on my dressing-table, will explain
      anything," said Mary, as she proceeded to break the seal. "Of all the
      absurd ways of my Lady aunt, she has not a more ridiculous one than this
      trick of writing little notes, instead of speaking. She sees me every day,
      and might surely say whatever she wanted to say, without embalming it in a
      despatch. This, I perceive, is number four hundred and seventy-six, and I
      presume she 's correct in the score. Only think, Catty,&mdash;four hundred
      little epistles like this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And with these words she carelessly unfolded the letter and began to read
      it. All her indifference of manner, however, soon gave way to an
      expression of considerable eagerness, and she had no sooner finished the
      epistle than she recommenced and reread it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 'd never guess what tidings this brings me, Catty," said she, laying
      down the paper, and looking with an expression half sad, half comical.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe I might, then," said Catty, shaking her head knowingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, out with your guess, then, old lady, and I promise to venerate your
      wisdom ever after if you be right,&mdash;that is, if nobody has already
      given you a hint on the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not one in the world," said Catty, solemnly; "I pledge you my word and
      faith I never heard a syllable about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About it! about what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About what's in the letter there," said Catty, stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are therefore quite certain that you know it," said Mary, smiling,
      "so now let's have your interpretation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It 's a proposial," said Catty, with a slight wink.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A what!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A proposial&mdash;of marriage, I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      But before the words were out, Mary burst into a fit of laughter, so
      hearty and with such good-will that poor Catty felt perfectly ashamed of
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Catty," said she, at length, "you must have been reading fairy
      tales this morning; nothing short of such bright literature could have
      filled your mind with these imaginings. The object of the note is, I
      assure you, of a quite different kind;" and here she ran her eye once more
      over the epistle. "Yes," continued she, "it is written in my dear aunt's
      own peculiar style, and begins with a 'declaratory clause,' as I think Mr.
      Scanlan would call it, expressive of my lamentably neglected education,
      and then proceeds to the appropriate remedy, by telling me that I am to
      have a governess!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A what!" cried Catty, in angry amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A governess, Catty,&mdash;not a governor, as you suspected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ayeh, ayeh!" cried the old woman, wringing her hands; "what's this for?
      Don't you know how to govern yourself by this time? And what can they
      teach you that you don't understand already?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my dear Catty," said the young girl, sadly, "it is a sad subject you
      would open there,&mdash;one that I have wept over many a dreary hour! No
      one knows&mdash;no one even could guess&mdash;how deeply I have deplored
      my illiterate condition. Nor was it," added she, ardently, "till I had
      fashioned out a kind of existence of my own&mdash;active, useful, and
      energetic&mdash;that I could bury the thought of my utter want of
      education. Not even you, Catty, could fathom all the tears this theme has
      cost me, nor with what a sinking of the heart I have thought over my
      actual unfitness for my station."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arrah, don't provoke me! don't drive me mad!" cried the old woman, in
      real anger. "There never was one yet as fit for the highest place as
      yourself; and it is n't me alone that says it, but hundreds of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hundreds of dear, kind, loving hearts," broke in Mary, "that would
      measure my poor capacity by my will to serve them. But no matter, Catty; I
      'll not try to undeceive them. They shall think of me with every help
      their own affection may lend them, and I will not love them less for the
      overestimate."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke these words, she buried her face between her hands; but the
      quick heaving of her chest showed how deep was her emotion. The old woman
      respected her sorrow too deeply to interrupt her, and for several minutes
      not a word was spoken on either side. At last Mary raised her head, and
      throwing back the long, loose hair, which in heavy masses shaded her face,
      said with a firm and resolute voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'd have courage to go to school to-morrow, Catty, and begin as a mere
      child to learn, if I knew that another was ready to take my place here.
      But who is to look after these poor people, who are accustomed now to see
      me amongst them, on the mountains, in the fields, at their firesides?&mdash;who
      gain new spirit for labor when I ride down in the midst of them, and look
      up, cheered, by seeing me, even from a sick-bed. Her Ladyship would say,
      Mr. Henderson could do all this far better than myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Henderson, indeed!" exclaimed Catty, indignantly; "the smooth-tongued
      old rogue!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And perhaps he might, in England," resumed Mary; "but not here, Catty,&mdash;not
      here! We care less for benefits than the source from which they spring. We
      Irish cherish the love of motives as well as actions; and, above all, we
      cherish the links that bind the lowliest in the land with the highest, and
      make both better by the union."
    </p>
    <p>
      She poured out these words with rapid impetuosity, rather talking to
      herself than addressing her companion; then, suddenly changing her tone,
      she added,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides, Catty, <i>they</i> are used to me, and <i>I</i> to <i>them</i>.
      A new face and a new voice would not bring the same comfort to them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, never," muttered the old woman to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I 'll not desert them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you won't, darling," said the old woman, kissing her hand
      passionately, while tears swam in her eyes, and trickled down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is but one thought, Catty, that makes me at all faint-hearted about
      this, and whenever it crosses me I do feel very low and depressed." She
      paused, and then murmured the words, "My father!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father, my darling! What about <i>him?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is thinking, Catty, of his return; an event that ought to be&mdash;and
      would be, too&mdash;the very happiest of my life; a day for whose coming I
      never sleep without a prayer; and yet, even this bright prospect has its
      dark side, when I recall all my own deficiencies, and how different he
      will find his daughter from what he had expected her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May the blessed saints grant me patience!" cried Catty, breaking in.
      "Isn't it too bad to hear you talking this way? Sure, don't I know Master
      Barry well? Didn't I nurse him, and wasn't I all as one as his own mother
      to him, and don't I know that you are his own born image? 'Tis himself and
      no other ye are every minute of the day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And even that, Catty," said Mary, smiling, "might fail to satisfy him. It
      is something very different indeed he might have imagined his daughter.
      I'm sure nobody can be more ignorant than I am, of what a person in my
      station ought to know. I cannot hide this from myself in my sad moments. I
      do not try to do so, but I have always relied upon the consolation that,
      to an existence such as mine is like to be, these deficiencies do not
      bring the same sense of shame, the same painful consciousness of
      inferiority, as if I were to mingle with the world of my equals. But if he
      were to come back,&mdash;he, who has seen society in every shape and
      fashion,&mdash;and find me the poor, unlettered, unread, untaught thing I
      am, unable to follow his very descriptions of far-away lands without
      confusion and mistake; unable to benefit by his reflections from very want
      of previous knowledge,&mdash;oh, Catty dearest, what a miserable thing is
      self-love after all, when it should thus thrust itself into the
      foreground, where very different affections alone should have the place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He 'd love you like his own heart," said Catty. "Nobody knows him like
      me; and if there was ever one made for him to dote on, it's your own
      self."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you indeed think so?" cried Mary, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I know it&mdash;could I swear it?" said Catty. "He was never much
      given to study himself, except it was books of travel like 'Robinson
      Crusoe,' and the like; and then, after reading one of them books he 'd be
      off for days together, and we 'd be looking for him over the whole
      country, and maybe find him in the middle of Kyle's Wood up a tree; or
      once, indeed, it was in the island of Lettermullen we got him. He built a
      mud-house, and was living there with a goat and two rabbits that he reared
      himself, and if he was n't miserable when they brought him away home! I
      remember his words well,&mdash;'Maybe,' says he, 'the time will come that
      I 'll go where you can't come after me;' and ye see that's what he's done,
      for nobody knows where he wasn't wandering these last eight or nine
      years."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Catty got upon this theme she could not be brought to quit it,&mdash;nor,
      indeed, did Mary try,&mdash;for though she had heard these stories of her
      father's boyish days over and over again, she never wearied of them; they
      had all the fascination of romance for her, with the stronger interest
      that grew out of her love for one who, she was told, had so loved herself.
      Besides this, she felt in her own heart the same promptings to a life of
      action and adventure. All the incidents and accidents of an eventful
      existence were the very things to delight her, and one of her happiest
      daydreams was to fancy herself her father's companion in his wanderings by
      flood and field.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus they sat till a late hour of the night talking and listening, old
      Catty answering each inquiry of the young girl by some anecdote or trait
      of him she still persisted in calling "Master Barry," till, in the ardor
      of listening, Mary herself caught up the phrase, and so designated her own
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How unlike my uncle in everything!" exclaimed Mary, as she reflected over
      some traits the old woman had just recorded. "And were they not very fond
      of each other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That they were: at least I can answer for Master Barry's love; and to be
      sure, if having a reason was worth anything, your uncle ought to love him
      more than one man ever did another." Old Catty uttered these words with a
      slow and almost muttering accent; they seemed as if the expression of a
      thought delivered involuntarily&mdash;almost unconsciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was attracted by the unwonted solemnity of her accent, but still more
      by an expression of intense meaning which gathered over the old woman's
      brows and forehead. "Ay, ay," muttered she, still to herself, "there's few
      brothers would do it. Maybe there's not another living but himself would
      have done it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what was it, Catty?" asked Mary, boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh!&mdash;what was I saying, darling?" said Catty, rousing herself to
      full consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were telling of my father, and some great proof of affection he gave
      my uncle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure he did," said the old woman, hastily. "They were always fond
      of each other, as brothers ought to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But this one particular instance of love,&mdash;what was it, Catty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman started, and looked eagerly around the room, as though to
      assure herself that they were alone; then, drawing her chair close to
      Mary's, she said, in a low voice: "Don't ask me any more about them
      things, darling. 'T is past and gone many a year now, and I 'd rather
      never think of it more, for I 've a heavy heart after it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, then, it is a secret, Catty?" said Mary, half proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A secret, indeed," said Catty, shaking her head mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you need only to have said so, and I'd not have importuned you to
      tell it; for, to say truth, Catty, I never knew you had any secrets from
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor have I another, except this, darling," said Catty; and she buried her
      face within her hands. And now both sat in silence for some minutes,&mdash;a
      most painful silence to each. At last Mary arose, and, although evidently
      trying to overcome it, a feeling of constraint was marked in her features.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd never guess how late it is, Catty," said she, trying to change the
      current of her thoughts. "You 'd not believe it is past three o'clock; how
      pleasantly we must have talked, to forget time in this way!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the old woman made no reply, and it was clear that she had never heard
      the words, so deeply was she sunk in her own reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This poor hat of mine will scarcely do another day's service," said Mary,
      as she looked at it half laughingly. "Nor is my habit the fresher of its
      bath in the 'Red River;' and the worst of it is, Catty, I have overdrawn
      my quarter's allowance, and must live on, in rags, till Easter. I see, old
      lady, you have no sympathies to waste on me and my calamities this
      evening," added she, gayly, "and so I'll just go to bed and, if I can,
      dream pleasantly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rags, indeed," said Catty. "It's well it becomes you to wear rags!" and
      her eyes sparkled with indignant passion. "Faith, if it comes to that,"&mdash;here
      she suddenly paused, and a pale hue spread over her features like a qualm
      of faintish sickness,&mdash;"may the Holy Mother give me help and advice;
      for sometimes I'm nigh forgetting myself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear old Catty," said Mary, fondly, "don't fret about me and my
      foolish speech. I only said it in jest. I have everything,&mdash;far more
      than I want; a thousand times more than I desire. And my excellent aunt
      never said a truer thing in her life than when she declared that
      'everybody spoiled me.' Now, good-night." And kissing the old woman
      affectionately, Mary gathered up the stray fragments of her riding-gear,
      and hurried away, her merry voice heard cheerfully as she wended her way
      up many a stair and gallery to her own chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mary Martin's character had any one quality preeminently remarkable, it
      was the absence of everything like distrust and suspicion. Frankness and
      candor itself in all her dealings, she never condescended to impute secret
      motives to another; and the very thought of anything like mystery was
      absolutely repugant to her nature. For the very first time in her life,
      then, she left old Catty Broon with a kind of uneasy, dissatisfied
      impression. There was a secret, and she was somehow or other concerned in
      it; so much was clear. How could she convince the old woman that no
      revelation, however disagreeable in itself, could be as torturing as a
      doubt? "Can there be anything in my position or circumstances here that I
      am not aware of? Is there a mystery about me in any way?" The very
      imagination of such a thing was agony. In vain she tried to chase away the
      unwelcome thought by singing, as she went, by thinking over plans for the
      morrow, by noting down, as she did each night, some stray records of the
      past day; still Catty's agitated face and strange emotion rose before her,
      and would not suffer her to be at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a day of great excitement and fatigue now succeeded a sleepless,
      feverish night, and morning broke on her unrefreshed, and even ill.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. A FINE OLD IRISH BARRISTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Can any one tell us what has become of that high conversational power for
      which Ireland, but more especially Dublin, was once celebrated? Have the
      brilliant talkers of other days left no successors? Has that race of
      delightful con-vivialists gone and disappeared forever? Or are we only
      enduring an interregnum of dulness, the fit repose, perhaps, after a
      period of such excitement? The altered circumstances of the country will
      doubtless account for much of this change. The presence of a Parliament in
      Ireland imparted a dignity and importance to society, while it secured to
      social intercourse the men who made that Senate illustrious. The Bar, too,
      of former days, was essentially the career of the highest class, of those
      who had the ambition of political success without the necessity of toiling
      for it through the laborious paths of the law; and thus the wit, the
      brilliancy, and the readiness which gives conversation its charm, obtained
      the high culture which comes of a learned profession, and the social
      intercourse with men of refined understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the Union this spirit died out. Some of the brightest and gayest
      retired from the world, sad, dispirited, and depressed; some felt that a
      new and very different career was to open before them, and addressed
      themselves to the task of conforming to new habits and acquiring new
      influences; and others, again, sought in the richer and greater country
      the rewards which they once were satisfied to reap in their own. With the
      Union, society in Dublin&mdash;using the word in its really comprehensive
      sense&mdash;ceased to exist. The great interests of a nation departed, men
      sank to the level of the small topics that engaged them, and gradually the
      smallest and narrowest views of mere local matters usurped the place of
      great events and liberal speculations. Towards the end of the first
      quarter of the present century, a few of those who had once made
      companionship with Curran and Grattan and Lysaght and Parsons were still
      in good health and vigor. A fine, high-hearted, manly class they were,
      full of that peculiar generosity of character which has ever marked the
      true Irish gentleman, and with a readiness in humor and a genial flow of
      pleasantry which rendered their society delightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this school&mdash;and probably the last, for he was then the Father of
      the Bar&mdash;was Valentine Repton, a man whose abilities might have won
      for him the very highest distinctions, but who, partly through indolence,
      and partly through a sturdy desire to be independent of all party, had all
      his life rejected every offer of advancement, and had seen his juniors
      pass on to the highest ranks of the profession, while he still wore his
      stuff-gown, and rose to address the Court from the outer benches.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was reported in early life to have professed very democratic opinions,
      for which he more than once had incurred the <i>deep</i> displeasure of
      the authorities of the University. The principles of the French Revolution
      had, however, been gradually toned down in him by time, and probably by a
      very aristocratic contempt for the party who advocated them; so that soon
      after he entered on his career at the Bar he seemed to have abandoned
      politics; nor, except by a sly jest or an epigram upon a party leader, no
      matter of which side, did he ever advert to the contests of statecraft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though closely approaching seventy, he was hale and vigorous, his gray
      eyes quick and full of fire, his voice clear, and his whole air and
      bearing that of one many years younger. He had been a "beau" in his youth,
      and there was in the accurately powdered hair, the lace ruffles in which
      he still appeared at dinner, and the well-fitting silk stocking, an
      evidence that he had not forgotten the attractions of dress. At the Bar he
      still maintained the very highest place. His powers of cross-examination
      were very great; his management of a jury unrivalled. A lifelong
      acquaintance with Dublin had familiarized him with the tone and temper of
      every class of its citizens, and had taught him the precise kind of
      argument, and the exact nature of the appeal to address to each. As he
      grew older, perhaps he did not observe all his wonted discretion in the
      use of this subtle power, and somewhat presumed upon his own skill. Nor
      was he so scrupulous in his deference to the Court,&mdash;a feature which
      had once pre-eminently distinguished him; but, upon the whole, he had kept
      wonderfully clear of the proverbial irritability of age, and was, without
      an exception, the favorite amongst his brethren.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only touch of years observable about his mind was a fondness for
      recurring to incidents or events in which he himself had borne a part. A
      case in which he held a brief, the dinner at which he had been brilliant,
      the epigram he had dashed off in Lady Somebody's drawing-room, were bright
      spots he could not refrain from adverting to; but, generally speaking, he
      had skill enough to introduce these without any seeming effort or any
      straining, and thus strangers, at least, were in wonderment at his endless
      stores of anecdote and illustration. No man better than he knew how to
      throw a great name into the course of a conversation, and make an audience
      for himself, by saying, "I remember one day at the Priory with Curran"&mdash;or,
      "We were dining with poor Grattan at Tinnehinch, when&mdash;" "As Flood
      once remarked to me&mdash;" and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flattery of being addressed by one who had stood in such intimate
      relation to those illustrious men never failed of success. The most
      thoughtless and giddy hearers were at once arrested by such an opening,
      and Repton was sure of listeners in every company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who finds his place in every society is unquestionably a clever
      man. The aptitude to chime in with the tone of others infers a high order
      of humor,&mdash;of humor in its real sense; meaning, thereby, the faculty
      of appreciating, and even cultivating, the individual peculiarities of
      those around him, and deriving from their display a high order of
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these scattered traits let my reader conjure up Valentine Repton
      before him, and imagine the bustling, active, and brisk-looking old
      gentleman whose fidgetiness nearly drove Martin mad, as they held converse
      together in the library after breakfast. Now seated, now rising to pace
      the room, or drawing nigh the window to curse the pelting rain without,
      Repton seemed the incarnation of uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very splendid&mdash;very grand&mdash;very sumptuous&mdash;no doubt," said
      he, ranging his eyes over the gorgeous decorations of the spacious
      apartment, "but would kill me in a month; what am I saying?&mdash;in a
      week!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would kill you, Repton?" said Martin, languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This life of yours, Martin,&mdash;this sombre quiet, this unbroken
      stillness, this grave-like monotony. Why, man, where 's your neighborhood?
      where are your gentry friends?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cosby Blake, of Swainestown, is abroad," said Martin, with an indolent
      drawl. "Randal Burke seldom comes down here now. Rickman, I believe, is in
      the Fleet. They were the nearest to us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a country! and you are spending&mdash;What did you tell me last
      night,&mdash;was it upwards of ten thousand a year here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What with planting, draining, bridging, reclaiming waste lands, and other
      improvements, the wages of last year alone exceeded seven thousand!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove! it 's nigh incredible," said the lawyer, energetically. "My dear
      Martin, can't you perceive that all this is sheer waste,&mdash;so much
      good money actually thrown into Lough Corrib? Tell me, frankly, how long
      have you been pursuing this system of improvement?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About three years; under Mary's management."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the results,&mdash;what of them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is too early to speak of that; there's Kyle's Wood, for instance,&mdash;we
      have enclosed that at considerable cost. Of course we can't expect that
      the mere thinnings can repay us, the first year or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your reclaimed land,&mdash;how has <i>it</i> prospered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not over well. They pushed draining so far that they 've left a large
      tract perfectly barren and unproductive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the harbor,&mdash;the pier I saw yesterday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That 's a bad business,&mdash;it's filling up the bay with sand! but
      we'll alter it in summer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now for the people themselves,&mdash;are they better off, better fed,
      clothed, housed, and looked after, than before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary says so. She tells me that there is a wonderful change for the
      better in them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe a word of it, Martin,&mdash;not a word of it. Ireland is
      not to be redeemed by her own gentry. The thing is sheer impossibility!
      They both know each other too well. Do you understand me? They are too
      ready to make allowances for shortcomings that have their source in some
      national prejudice; whereas your Saxon or your Scotchman would scout such
      a plea at once. Ireland wants an alternative, Martin,&mdash;an
      alternative; and, amidst our other anomalies, not the least singular is
      the fact that the Englishman, who knows nothing about us, nor ever will
      know anything, is precisely the man to better our condition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These are strange opinions to hear from your lips, Repton. I never heard
      any man so sarcastic as yourself on English ignorance regarding Ireland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you may hear me again on the same theme whenever you vouchsafe me an
      audience," said the lawyer, sharply. "It was but the other day I gave our
      newly arrived secretary, Mr. Muspratt, a gentle intimation of my
      sentiments on that score. We were dining at the Lodge. I sat next his
      Excellency, who, in the course of dinner, directed my attention to a very
      graphic picture the secretary was drawing of the misery he had witnessed
      that very day, coming up from Carlow. He did the thing well, I must own.
      He gave the famished looks, the rags, the wretchedness, all their due; and
      he mingled his pathos and indignation with all the skill of an artist;
      while he actually imparted a Raffaelle effect to his sketch, as he
      portrayed the halt, the maimed, the blind, and the palsied that crowded
      around the carriage as he changed horses, exclaiming, by way of
      peroration, 'Misery and destitution like this no man ever witnessed
      before, all real and unfeigned as it was sure to be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Naas is a miserable place, indeed,' said I, for he looked directly
      towards me for a confirmation of his narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'There is no denying one word the gentleman has said; I came up that way
      from circuit three weeks ago, and was beset in the same spot, and in the
      same manner as we have just heard. I can't attempt such a description as
      Mr. Muspratt has given us; but I will say that there was not a human
      deformity or defect that did n't appear to have its representative in that
      ragged gathering, all clamorous and eager for aid. I looked at them for a
      while in wonderment, and at last I threw out a "tenpenny" in the midst.
      The "blind" fellow saw it first, but the "lame cripple" had the foot of
      him, and got the money!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Repton leaned back in his chair, and laughed heartily as he finished. "I
      only wish you saw his face, Martin; and, indeed, his Excellency's too. The
      aides-de-camp laughed; they were very young, and could n't help it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He 'll not make you a chief justice, Repton," said Martin, slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll take care he don't," said the other. "<i>Summum jus summa injuria</i>.
      The chief justice is a great humbug, or a great abuse, whichever way you
      like to render it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet they'd be glad to promote you," said Martin, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure they would, sir; delighted to place me where they had no fear
      of my indiscretions. But your judge should be ever a grave animal. The
      temptation to a joke should never sit on the ermine. As Flood once
      remarked to me of old Romney, 'A man, sir,' said he,&mdash;and Flood had a
      semi-sarcastic solemnity always about him,&mdash;'a man, sir, who has
      reversed the law of physics; for he rose by his gravity, and only fell by
      his lightness.' Very epigrammatic and sharp, that. Ah, Martin, they don't
      say these things nowadays. By the way, who is the young fellow who dined
      with us yesterday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His name is Nelligan; the son of one of our Oughterard neighbors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pleasing manners, gentle, too, and observant," said Repton, with the tone
      of one delivering a judgment to be recorded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's more than that," said Martin; "he is the great prize man of the year
      in Trinity. You must have surely heard of his name up in town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think somebody did speak of him to me,&mdash;recommend him, in some
      shape or other," said Repton, abstractedly; "these things are so easily
      forgotten; for, to say the truth, I hold very cheaply all intellectual
      efforts accomplished by great preparation. The cramming, the grinding, the
      plodding, the artificial memory work, and the rest of it, detract
      terribly, in my estimation, from the glory of success. Give me your man of
      impromptu readiness, never unprepared, never at a loss. The very
      consciousness of power is double power." And as he spoke he drew himself
      up, threw his head back, and stared steadfastly at Martin, as though to
      say, "Such is he who now stands before you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin was amused at the display of vanity, and had there been another
      there to have participated in the enjoyment, would have willingly
      encouraged him to continue the theme; but he was alone, and let it pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll make a note of that young man. Mulligan, is n't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nelligan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure. I 'll remember poor Curran's epigram:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'Oh, pity poor Tom Nelligan!
     Who walking down Pall Mall,
     He slipt his foot,
     And down he fell,
     And fears he won't get well again.'
</pre>
    <p>
      Glorious fellow, sir; the greatest of all the convivialists of his time,
      was Curran. A host in himself; but, as he once said, you could n't always
      depend on the 'elevation.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin smiled faintly; he relished the lawyer's talk, but he felt that it
      demanded an amount of attention on his part that wearied him. Anything
      that cost him trouble was more or less of a "bore;" and he already began
      to wish for his accustomed ease and indolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Repton," said he, "you wished to see the quarries, I think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To see everything and everybody, sir, and with my own eyes, too. As
      Lysaght said, when I read the book of nature, 'I let no man note my brief
      for me.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought of being your companion, myself; but somehow, this morning, my
      old enemy, the gout, is busy again; however, you 'll not regret the
      exchange, Repton, when I give you in charge to my niece. She 'll be but
      too happy to do the honors of our poor country to so distinguished a
      visitor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a very artful plan to put me in good humor with everything," said
      Repton, laughing. "Well, I consent. I offer myself a willing victim to any
      amount of seduction. How are we to go?&mdash;do we drive, walk, or ride?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Mary be consulted, she'll say ride," said Martin; "but perhaps&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm for the saddle, too," broke in Repton. "Give me something active and
      lively, light of mouth and well up before, and I'll show you, as Tom
      Parsons said, that we can cut as good a figure at the wall as the 'bar.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll go and consult my niece, then," said Martin, hastening out of the
      room, to conceal the smile which the old man's vanity had just provoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was dressed in her riding-habit, and about to leave her room as her
      uncle entered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have just come in the nick of time, Molly, I see," cried he. "I want
      you to lionize an old friend of mine, who has the ambition to 'do'
      Connemara under your guidance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a provoke!" said Mary, half aloud. "Could he not wait for another
      day, uncle? I have to go over to Glencalgher and Kilduff; besides, there's
      that bridge to be looked after, and they 've just come to tell me that the
      floods have carried away the strong paling around the larch copse. Really,
      this old gentleman must wait." It was a rare thing for Mary Martin to
      display anything either of impatience or opposition to her uncle. Her
      affection for him was so blended with respect that she scarcely ever
      transgressed in this wise; but this morning she was ill and irritable,&mdash;a
      restless, feverish night following on a day of great fatigue and as great
      excitement,&mdash;and she was still suffering, and her nerves jarring when
      he met her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I assure you, Molly, you 'll be pleased with the companionship,"
      began Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I might at another time; but I 'm out of sorts to-day, uncle. I 'm
      cross and ill-tempered, and I 'll have it out on Mr. Henderson,&mdash;that
      precious specimen of his class. Let Mr. Nelligan perform cicerone, or
      persuade my Lady to drive him out; do anything you like with him, except
      give him to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet that is exactly what I have promised him. As for Nelligan, they
      are not suited to each other; so come, be a good girl, and comply."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I must," said she, pettishly. "And how are we to go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He proposes to ride, and bespeaks something lively for his own mount."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! That sounds well!" cried she, with more animation. "There 's
      'Cropper' in great heart; he 'll carry him to perfection. I 'll have a
      ring-snaffle put on him, and my word for it but he 'll have a pleasant
      ride."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care, Molly; take care that he's not too fresh. Remember that Repton
      is some dozen years or more my senior."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him keep him off the grass and he 'll go like a lamb. I'll not answer
      for him on the sward, though; but I 'll look to him, uncle, and bring him
      back safe and sound." And, so saying, Mary bounded away down the stairs,
      and away to the stables, forgetting everything of her late discontent, and
      only eager on the plan before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin was very far from satisfied about the arrangement for his friend's
      equitation; nor did the aspect of Repton himself, as attired for the road,
      allay that sense of alarm; the old lawyer's costume being a correct copy
      of the colored prints of those worthies who figured in the early years of
      George the Third's reign,&mdash;a gray cloth spencer being drawn over his
      coat, fur-collared and cuffed, high riding-boots of black polished
      leather, reaching above the knee, and large gauntlets of bright yellow
      doeskin, completing an equipment which Martin had seen nothing resembling
      for forty years back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A perfect cavalier, Repton!" exclaimed he, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We once could do a little that way," said the other, with a touch of
      vanity. "In our early days, Martin, hunting was essentially a gentleman's
      pastime. The meet was not disfigured by aspiring linen drapers or
      ambitious hardwaremen, and the tone of the field was the tone of society;
      but <i>nous avons changé tout cela</i>. Sporting men, as they call
      themselves, have descended to the groom vocabulary; and the groom morals,
      and we, of the old school, should only be laughed at for the pedantry of
      good manners and good English, did we venture amongst them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My niece will put a different estimate on your companionship; and here
      she comes. Molly, my old and valued friend, Mr. Repton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I kiss your hand, Miss Martin," said he, accompanying the speech by the
      act, with all the grace of a courtier. "It's worth while being an old
      fellow, to be able to claim these antiquated privileges."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in the jaunty air and well-assumed gallantry of the
      old lawyer which at once pleased Mary, who accepted his courtesy with a
      gracious smile. She had been picturing to herself a very different kind of
      companion, and was well satisfied with the reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I proposed to young Mr. Nelligan to join us," said Repton, as he
      conducted her to the door; "but it seems he is too deeply intent upon some
      question or point of law or history&mdash;I forget which&mdash;whereupon
      we differed last night, and has gone into the library to search for the
      solution of it. As for me, Miss Martin, I am too young for such dry
      labors; or, as the Duc de Nevers said, when somebody rebuked him for
      dancing at seventy, 'Only think what a short time is left me for folly.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not propose to chronicle, the subjects or the sayings by which the
      old lawyer beguiled the way; enough if we say that Mary was actually
      delighted with his companionship. The racy admixture of humor and strong
      common-sense, acute views of life, flavored with, now a witty remark, now
      a pertinent anecdote, were conversational powers totally new to her. Nor
      was he less charmed with her. Independently of all the pleasure it gave
      him to find one who heard him with such true enjoyment, and relished all
      his varied powers of amusing, he was equally struck with the high-spirited
      enthusiasm and generous ardor of the young girl. She spoke of the people
      and the country with all the devotion of one who loved both; and if at
      times with more of hopefulness than he himself could feel, the sanguine
      forecast but lent another charm to her fascination.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened with astonishment as she explained to him the different works
      then in progress,&mdash;the vast plans for drainage; the great enclosures
      for planting; the roads projected here, the bridges there. At one place
      were strings of carts, conveying limestone for admixture with the colder
      soil of low grounds; at another they met asses loaded with seaweed for the
      potato land. There was movement and occupation on every side. In the deep
      valleys, on the mountains, in the clefts of the rocky shore, in the dark
      marble quarries, hundreds of people were employed; and by these was Mary
      welcomed with eager enthusiasm the moment she appeared. One glance at
      their delighted features was sufficient to show that theirs was no
      counterfeit joy. Wherever she went the same reception awaited her; nor did
      she try to conceal the happiness it conferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is very wonderful, very strange, and very fascinating, Miss Martin,"
      said Repton, as they moved slowly through a rocky path, escarped from the
      side of the mountain; "but pardon me if I venture to suggest one gloomy
      anticipation in the midst of such brightness. What is to become of all
      these people when <i>you</i> leave them,&mdash;as leave them you will and
      must, one day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never mean to do so," said Mary, resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stoutly spoken," said he, smiling; "but, unfortunately, he who hears it
      could be your grandfather. And again I ask, how is this good despotism to
      be carried on when the despot abdicates? Nay, nay; there never was a very
      beautiful girl yet, with every charm under heaven, who did n't swear she
      'd never marry; so let us take another alternative. Your uncle may go to
      live in London,&mdash;abroad. He may sell Cro' Martin&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that is impossible! He loves the old home of his family and his name
      too dearly; he would be incapable of such a treason to his house!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, remember, my dear young lady, you are speaking to the most
      suspectful, unimpulsive, and ungenerously disposed of all natures, an old
      lawyer, who has witnessed so many events in life he would have once
      pronounced impossible,&mdash;ay, just as roundly as you said the word
      yourself,&mdash;and seen people and things under aspects so totally the
      reverse of what he first knew them, that he has taught himself to believe
      that change is the law, and not permanence, in this life, and that you and
      I, and all of us, ought ever to look forward to anything, everything, but
      the condition in which at present we find ourselves. Now, I don't want to
      discourage you with the noble career you have opened for yourself here. I
      am far more likely to be fascinated&mdash;I was going to say fall in love&mdash;with
      you for it, than to try and turn your thoughts elsewhere; but as to these
      people themselves, the experiment comes too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it ever too late to repair a wrong, to assist destitution, relieve
      misery, and console misfortune?" broke in Mary, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is too late to try the feudal system in the year of our Lord 1829,
      Miss Martin. We live in an age where everything is to be redressed by a
      Parliament. The old social compact between proprietor and peasant is
      repealed, and all must be done by 'the House.' Now, if your grandfather
      had pursued the path that you are doing to-day, this crisis might never
      have arrived; but he did not, young lady. He lived like a real gentleman;
      he hunted, and drank, and feasted, and rack-rented, and horsewhipped all
      around him; and what with duelling of a morning and drinking over-night,
      taught the people a code of morals that has assumed all the compactness of
      a system. Ay, I say it with grief, this is a land corrupted from the top,
      and every vice of its gentry has but filtered down to its populace! What
      was that I heard?&mdash;was it not a shot?" cried he, reining in his horse
      to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought so, too; but it might be a blast, for we are not far from the
      quarries."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you preserve the game, Miss Martin? are you sworn foe to the
      poacher?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do so; but in reality more for the sake of the people than the
      partridges. Your lounging country fellow, with a rusty gun and a starved
      lurcher, is but an embryo highwayman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he is," cried Repton, delighted at the energy with which she spoke;
      "and I have always thought that the worst thing about the game-laws was
      the class of fellows we educate to break them. Poor old Cranbury was n't
      of that opinion, though. You could never have seen him, Miss Martin; but
      he was a fine specimen of the Irish Bench in the old time. He was the
      readiest pistol in the Irish house; and, as they said then, he 'shot up'
      into preferment. He always deemed an infraction of the game-laws as one of
      the gravest crimes in the statute. Juries, however, did n't concur with
      him; and, knowing the severity of the penalty, they invariably brought in
      a verdict of Not Guilty, rather than subject a poor wretch to
      transportation for a jack-snipe. I remember once,&mdash;it was at
      Maryborough; the fellow in the dock was a notable poacher, and, worse
      still, the scene of his exploits was Cranbury's own estate. As usual, the
      jury listened apathetically to the evidence; they cared little for the
      case, and had predetermined the verdict. It was, however, so palpably
      proven, so self-evident that he was guilty, that they clubbed their heads
      together to concert a pretext for their decision. Cranbury saw the
      movement, and appreciated it, and, leaning his head down upon his hand,
      mumbled out, as if talking to himself, in broken sentences, 'A poor man&mdash;with
      a large family&mdash;great temptation&mdash;and, after all, a slight
      offence,&mdash;a very slight offence.' The jury listened and took courage;
      they fancied some scruples were at work in the old judge's heart, and that
      they might venture on the truth, innocuously. 'Guilty, my Lord,' said the
      foreman. 'Transportation for seven years!' cried the judge, with a look at
      the jury-box that there was no mistaking. They were 'done,' but there
      never was another conviction in that town afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And were such things possible on the justice-seat?" exclaimed Mary, in
      horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my dear young lady, I could tell you of far worse than that. There
      was a time in this country when the indictment against the prisoner was
      Secondary in importance to his general character, his party, his
      connections, and fifty other things which had no bearing upon criminality.
      There goes another shot! I 'll swear to that," cried he, pulling up short,
      and looking in the direction from which the report proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary turned at the same moment, and pointed with her whip towards a beech
      wood that skirted the foot of the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it from that quarter the sound came?" said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sharp crack of a fowling-piece, quickly followed by a second report,
      now decided the question; and, as if by mutual consent, they both wheeled
      their horses round, and set off at a brisk canter towards the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have taken especial pains about preserving this part of the estate,"
      said Mary, as they rode along. "It was my cousin Harry's favorite cover
      when he was last at home, and he left I can't say how many directions
      about it when quitting us; though, to say truth, I never deemed any
      precautions necessary till he spoke of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that poaching was unknown down here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Almost completely so; now and then some idle fellow with a half-bred
      greyhound might run down a hare, or with a rusty firelock knock over a
      rabbit, but there it ended. And as we have no gentry neighbors to ask for
      leave, and the Oughterard folks would not venture on that liberty, I may
      safely say that the report of a gun is a rare event in these solitudes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whoever he be, yonder, is not losing time," said Rep-ton; "there was
      another shot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Their pace had now become a smart half-gallop; Mary, a little in advance,
      leading the way, and pointing out the safe ground to her companion. As
      they drew nigh the wood, however, she slackened speed till he came up, and
      then said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I know everybody hereabouts, it will be enough if I only see the
      offender; and how to do that is the question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am at your orders," said Repton, raising his whip to a salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be somewhat difficult," said Mary, pondering; "the wood is so
      overgrown with low copse that one can't ride through it, except along
      certain alleys. Now we might canter there for hours and see nothing. I
      have it," cried she, suddenly; "you shall enter the wood and ride slowly
      along the green alley, yonder, till you come to the crossroad, when you
      'll turn off to the left; while I will remain in observation outside here,
      so that if our friend make his exit I am sure to overtake him. At all
      events, we shall meet again at the lower end of the road."
    </p>
    <p>
      Repton made her repeat her directions, and then, touching his hat in
      respectful salutation, rode away to fulfil his mission. A low gate, merely
      fastened by a loop of iron without a padlock, admitted the lawyer within
      the precincts, in which he soon discovered that his pace must be a walk,
      so heavy was the deep clayey soil, littered with fallen leaves and rotting
      acorns. Great trees bent their massive limbs over his head, and, even
      leafless as they were, formed a darksome, gloomy aisle, the sides of which
      were closed in with the wild holly and the broom, and even the arbutus,
      all intermingled inextricably. There was something solemn even to sadness
      in the deep solitude, and so Repton seemed to feel as he rode slowly
      along, alone, tingeing his thoughts of her he had just quitted with
      melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a girl and what a life!" said he, musingly. "I must tell Martin that
      this will never do! What can all this devotion end in but disappointment!
      With the first gleam of their newly acquired power the people will reject
      these benefits; they will despise the slow-won fruits of industry as the
      gambler rejects a life of toil. Then will come a reaction&mdash;a terrible
      reaction&mdash;with all the semblance of black ingratitude! She will
      herself be disgusted. The breach once made will grow wider and wider, and
      at last the demagogue will take the place of the landed proprietor.
      Estrangement at first, next distrust, and finally dislike, will separate
      the gentry from the peasantry, and then&mdash;I tremble to think of what
      then!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As Repton had uttered these words, the sharp bang of a gun startled him,
      and at the same instant a young fellow sprang from the copse in front of
      him into the alley. His coarse fustian shooting-jacket, low-crowned
      oil-skin hat, and leather gaiters seemed to bespeak the professional
      poacher, and Repton dashed forward with his heavy riding-whip upraised
      towards him.

    <p>
      "Take care, old gentleman," said the young man, facing about; "my second
      barrel is loaded, and if you dare&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Heaven! I'll thrash you, you scoundrel!" said Repton, whose passion
      was now boiling over by a sudden bound of the cob, which had nearly thrown
      him from the saddle,&mdash;a mischance greeted by a hearty burst of
      laughter from the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancy you have quite enough to do at this moment!" cried he, still
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half mad with anger, Repton pressed his spurs to the cob's flanks, while
      he gave him a vigorous cut of the whip on the shoulder. The animal was
      little accustomed to such usage, and reared up wildly, and would
      inevitably have fallen back with his rider, had not the stranger,
      springing forward, seized the bridle, and pulled him down by main force.
      Whether indifferent to his own safety, or so blinded by passion as not to
      recognize to what he owed it, the old man struck the other a heavy blow
      with his whip over the head, cutting through his hat, and covering his
      face with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man passing his arm through the bridle, so as to render the
      other's escape impossible, coolly removed his hat and proceeded to stanch
      the bleeding with his handkerchief,&mdash;not the slightest sign of
      excitement being displayed by him, nor any evidence of feeling that the
      event was other than a more accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let loose my bridle-rein,&mdash;let it loose, sir," said Repton,
      passionately,&mdash;more passionately, perhaps, from observing the
      measured calmness of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I know who you are, I shall," said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is Valentine Repton; my address, if you want it, is Merrion
      Square North, Dublin; and can you now tell me where a magistrate's warrant
      will reach <i>you?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My present residence is a house you may have seen on the side of the
      mountain as you came along, called, I think, Barnagheela; my name is
      Massingbred."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You presume to be a gentleman, then?" said Repton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not heard the matter disputed before," said Jack, with an easy
      smile, while he leisurely bound the handkerchief round his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And of course, you look for satisfaction for this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust that there can be no mistake upon that point, at least," replied
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you shall have it, too; though, hang me, if I well know whether you
      should not receive it at the next assizes,&mdash;but you shall have it. I
      'll go into Oughterard this day; I 'll be there by nine o'clock, at the
      Martin Arms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will do," said Massingbred, with a coolness almost like
      indifference; while he resumed his gun, which he had thrown down, and
      proceeded to load the second barrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are aware that you are poaching here?" said Repton,&mdash;"that this
      is part of the Martin estate, and strictly preserved?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! and I thought it belonged to Magennis," said Jack, easily; "but a
      preserve without a gamekeeper, or even a notice, is a blockade without a
      blockading squadron." And without a word more, or any notice of the other,
      Massingbred shouldered his gun and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some time before Repton could summon resolution to leave the spot,
      such was the conflict of thoughts that went on within him. Shame and
      sorrow were, indeed, uppermost in his mind, but still not unmingled with
      anger at the consummate ease and coolness of the other, who by this line
      of conduct seemed to assume a tone of superiority the most galling and
      insulting. In vain did he endeavor to justify his act to himself,&mdash;in
      vain seek to find a plausible pretext for his anger. He could not, by all
      his ingenuity, do so, and he only grew more passionate at his own failure.
      "Another would hand him over to the next justice of the peace,&mdash;would
      leave him to quarter sessions; but not so Val Repton. No, by Jove, he 'll
      find a man to his humor there, if he wants fighting," said he, aloud, as
      he turned his horse about and rode slowly back.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was already dusk when he joined Miss Martin, who, uneasy at his
      prolonged absence, had entered the wood in search of him. It required all
      the practised dissimulation of the old lawyer to conceal the signs of his
      late adventure; nor, indeed, were his replies to her questions quite free
      from a certain amount of inconsistency. Mary, however, willingly changed
      the subject, and led him back to speak of topics more agreeable and
      congenial to him. Still he was not the same sprightly companion who had
      ridden beside her in the morning. He conversed with a degree of effort,
      and, when suffered, would relapse into long intervals of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who inhabits that bleak-looking house yonder?" said he, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A certain Mr. Magennis, a neighbor, but not an acquaintance, of ours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how comes it that he lives in the very middle, as it were, of the
      estate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An old lease, obtained I can't say how many centuries back, and which
      will expire in a year or two. He has already applied for a renewal of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And of course, unsuccessfully?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Up to this moment it is as you say, but I am endeavoring to persuade my
      uncle not to disturb him; nor would he, if Magennis would only be commonly
      prudent. You must know that this person is the leading Radical of our town
      of Oughterard, the man who sets himself most strenuously in opposition to
      our influence in the borough, and would uproot our power there, were he
      able."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So far, then, he is a courageous fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes I take that view of his conduct, and at others I am disposed to
      regard him as one not unwilling to make terms with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How subtle all these dealings can make a young lady!" said Repton, slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, rather, what a strain upon one's acuteness it is to ride out with a
      great lawyer, one so trained to see spots in the sun that he won't
      acknowledge its brightness if there be a speck to search for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet it's a great mistake to suppose that we are always looking on the
      dark side of human nature," said he, reflectively; "though," added he,
      after a pause, "it's very often our business to exaggerate baseness, and
      make the worst of a bad man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even that may be more pardonable than to vilify a good one," said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is, young lady; you are quite right there." He was thoughtful for a
      while, and then said: "It is very singular, but nevertheless true, that,
      in my profession, one loses sight of the individual, as such, and only
      regards him as a mere element of the case, plaintiff or defendant as he
      may be. I remember once, in a southern circuit, a hale, fine-looking young
      fellow entering my room to present me with a hare. He had walked twelve
      miles to offer it to me. 'Your honor doesn't remember me,' said he,
      sorrowfully, and evidently grieved at my forgetfulness. 'To be sure I do,'
      replied I, trying to recall his features; 'you are&mdash;let me see&mdash;you
      are&mdash;I have it&mdash;you are Jemmy Ryan.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No, sir,' rejoined he, quickly, 'I'm the boy that murdered him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, Miss Martin, there's a leaf out of a lawyer's notebook, and yet I
      could tell you more good traits of men and women, more of patient
      martyrdom under wrong, more courageous suffering to do right, than if I
      were&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;a chaplain in a nobleman's family."
    </p>
    <p>
      Repton's memory was well stored with instances in question, and he
      beguiled the way by relating several, till they reached Cro' Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there is another yet," added he, at the close, "more strongly
      illustrating what I have said than all these, but I cannot tell it to <i>you</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?" asked she, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a family secret, Miss Martin, and one that in all likelihood you
      shall never know. Still, I cannot refrain from saying that you have in
      your own family as noble a specimen of self-sacrifice and denial as I ever
      heard of."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were already at the door as he said this, and a troop of servants had
      assembled to receive them. Mary, therefore, had no time for further
      inquiry, had such an attempt been of any avail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There goes the first dinner-bell, Miss Martin," said Repton, gayly. "I'm
      resolved to be in the drawing-room before you!" And with this he hopped
      briskly upstairs, while Mary hastened to her room to dress.

      CHAPTER XV. "A RUINED FORTUNE"
    </h2>
    <p>
      No stronger contrast could be presented than that offered by the house
      which called Mr. Magennis master, to all the splendor and elegance which
      distinguished Cro' Martin. Built on the side of a bleak, barren mountain,
      without a trace of cultivation,&mdash;not even a tree beside it,&mdash;the
      coarse stone walls, high pitched roof, and narrow windows seemed all
      devised in some spirit of derision towards its graceful neighbor. A low
      wall, coped with a formidable "frieze" of broken bottles and crockery,
      enclosed a space in front once destined for a garden, but left in its
      original state of shingle, intermixed with the remnants of building
      materials and scaffold planks. A long shed, abutting on the house,
      sheltered a cow and a horse; the latter standing with his head above a
      rickety half-door, and looking ruefully out at the dismal landscape
      beneath him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the windows were broken,&mdash;and in some no attempt at repair
      had been made,&mdash;indicating that the rooms within were left unused.
      The hall-door stood ajar, but fastened by a strong iron chain; but the
      roof, more than all besides, bespoke decay and neglect, the rafters being
      in many places totally bare, while in others some rude attempts at tiling
      compensated for the want of the original slates. A strong colony of
      jackdaws had established themselves in one of the chimneys; but from
      another, in the centre of the building, a thick volume of dark-blue smoke
      rolled continually, conveying, indeed, the only sign of habitation about
      this dreary abode.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inside of the house was, if possible, more cheerless than the out.
      Most of the rooms had never been finished, and still remained in their
      coarse brown plaster, and unprovided with grates or chimney-pieces. The
      parlor, <i>par excellence</i>, was a long, low-ceilinged chamber, with
      yellow-ochre walls, dimly lighted by two narrow windows; its furniture, a
      piece of ragged carpet beneath a rickety table of black mahogany, some
      half-dozen crazy chairs, and a small sideboard, surmounted by something
      that might mean buffet or bookcase, and now served for both, being
      indifferently garnished with glasses, decanters, and thumbed volumes,
      intermingled with salt-cellars, empty sauce-bottles, and a powder-flask.
    </p>
    <p>
      An atrociously painted picture of an officer in scarlet uniform hung over
      the fireplace, surmounted by an infantry sword, suspended by a much-worn
      sash. These were the sole decorations of the room, to which even the great
      turf fire that blazed on the hearth could not impart a look of comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now a little after nightfall; the shutters were closed, and two
      attenuated tallow candles dimly illuminated this dreary chamber. A patched
      and much discolored tablecloth, with some coarse knives and forks, bespoke
      preparation for a meal, and some half-dozen plates stood warming before
      the fire. But the room had no occupant; and, except for the beating of the
      shutters against the sash, as the wind whistled through the broken window,
      all was silent within it. Now and then a loud noise would resound through
      the house; doors would bang, and rafters rattle, as the hall-door would be
      partially opened to permit the head of a woman to peer out and listen if
      any one were coming; but a heavy sigh at each attempt showed that hope was
      still deferred, and the weary footfall of her steps, as she retired,
      betrayed disappointment. It was after one of these excursions that she sat
      down beside the kitchen fire, screening her face from the blaze with her
      apron, and then, in the subdued light, it might be seen that, although
      bearing many traces of sorrow and suffering, she was still young and
      handsome. Large masses of the silkiest brown hair, escaping from her cap,
      fell in heavy masses on her neck; her eyes were large and blue, and shaded
      by the longest lashes; her mouth, a little large, perhaps, was still
      beautifully formed, and her teeth were of surpassing whiteness. The
      expression of the whole face was of gentle simplicity and love,&mdash;love
      in which timidity, however, deeply entered, and made the feeling one of
      acute suffering. In figure and dress she was exactly like any other
      peasant girl, a gaudy silk handkerchief on her neck being the only article
      of assumed luxury in her costume. She wore shoes, it is true,&mdash;not
      altogether the custom of country girls,&mdash;but they were heavy and
      coarsely made, and imparted to her walk a hobbling motion that detracted
      from her appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large pot which hung suspended by a chain above the fire seemed to
      demand her especial care, and she more than once removed the wooden cover
      to inspect the contents; after which she invariably approached the window
      to listen, and then came back sorrowfully to her place, her lips muttering
      some low sounds inaudibly. Once she tried to hum a part of a song to try
      and beguile the time, but the effort was a failure, and, as her voice died
      away, two heavy tears stole slowly along her cheeks, and a deep sob burst
      from her; after which she threw her apron over her face, and buried her
      head in her lap. It was as she sat thus that a loud knocking shook the
      outer door, and the tones of a gruff voice rose even above the noise; but
      she heard neither. Again and again was the summons repeated, with the same
      result; and at last a handful of coarse gravel struck the kitchen window
      with a crash that effectually aroused her, and springing up in terror, she
      hastened to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant she had unhooked the heavy chain, and sheltering the candle
      with her hand, admitted a large powerfully built man, who was scarcely
      within the hall when he said angrily, "Where the devil were you, that you
      could n't hear me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was in the kitchen, Tom," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't call <i>me</i> Tom, d&mdash;&mdash;n you," replied he, violently.
      "Don't keep dinning into me the infernal fool that I've made of myself, or
      it will be worse for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure I never meant any harm by it; and it was your own self bid me do
      it," said she, meekly, as she assisted him to remove his dripping
      great-coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And don't I rue it well?" rejoined he, through his half-closed teeth.
      "Isn't it this confounded folly that has shut me out of the best houses in
      the county? My bitter curse on the day and the hour I first saw you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't say them words,&mdash;don't, or you'll break my poor heart,"
      cried she, clinging to him as he strode angrily into the parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be off with you,&mdash;be off to the kitchen, and leave me quiet," said
      he, rudely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There 's your slippers, sir," said she, meekly, as, bending down, she
      untied his heavy shooting-shoes, and replaced them by a pair of list ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the dinner ready?" asked he, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, sir; but Massin'bred is n't come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who the devil is Massingbred? Don't you think he might be Mister
      Massingbred out of <i>your</i> mouth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ax your pardon, sir, and his, too; but I didn't mean&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there,&mdash;away with you!" cried he, impatiently. "I 'm never in
      a bad humor that you don't make me worse." And he leaned his face between
      his hands over the fire, while she slipped noiselessly from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe he thinks he's doing me honor by staying here," burst he forth,
      suddenly, as he sprang to his legs and stared angrily around him. "Maybe
      he supposes that it's great condescension for him to put up with my humble
      house! Ay, and that it's <i>my</i> bounden duty to wait for <i>him</i> to
      any hour he pleases. If I thought he did,&mdash;if I was sure of it!"
      added he, with a deep guttural tone, while he struck his clenched fist
      violently against the chimney-piece. Then, seizing the large iron poker,
      he knocked loudly with it against the back of the fireplace,&mdash;a
      summons quickly answered by the appearance of the girl at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he come in since morning?" asked he, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, never," replied she, with a half courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor say what time he 'd be back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a word, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, maybe, he's not coming back,&mdash;taken French leave, as they call
      it, eh, Joan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of her name, spoken, too, in an accent of more friendly meaning,
      lighted up her face at once, and her large eyes swam in tears of gratitude
      towards him as she stood there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he 'd scarcely dare to do that!" said he, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," said she, echoing half unconsciously his opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what do <i>you</i> know about it?" said he, turning savagely on her.
      "Where were you born and bred, to say what any gentleman might do, at any
      time, or in anything? Is it Joan Landy, the herd's daughter, is going to
      play fine lady upon us! Faix, we 're come to a pretty pass now, in
      earnest! Be off with you! Away! Stop, what was that? Did n't you hear a
      shot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did, sir,&mdash;quite near the house, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      A sharp knocking now on the hall-door decided the question, and Magennis
      hastened to admit the arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a strange fact, and one of which we are satisfied merely to make
      mention, without attempting in the least to explain, but no sooner was
      Magennis in the presence of his young guest, than not only he seemed to
      forget all possible cause of irritation towards him, but to behave with a
      manner of, for him, the most courteous civility. He aided him to remove
      his shot-belt and his bag; took his hat from his hands, and carefully
      wiped it; placed a chair for him close to the fire; and then, as he turned
      to address him, remarked for the first time the blood-stained handkerchief
      which still bound his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you fall,&mdash;had you an accident?" asked he, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the other, laughing; "a bit of an adventure only, which I 'll
      tell you after dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it any of the people? Had you a fight&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, Magennis, you must exercise a little patience. Not a word, not a
      syllable, till I have eaten something, for I am actually famishing."
    </p>
    <p>
      A stout knock of the poker on the chimney summoned the dinner, and almost
      in the same instant the woman entered with a smoking dish of Irish stew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Joan, you're an angel," said Massingbred; "if there was a dish I was
      longing for on this cold, raw day, it was one of your glorious messes.
      They seem made for the climate, and by Jove, the climate for them. I say,
      Mac, does it always rain in this fashion here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; it sleets now and then, and sometimes blows."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think it does," said Jack, seating himself at the table. "The
      pleasant little slabs of marble one sees on the cabin-roofs to keep down
      the thatch are signs of your western zephyrs. Mrs. Joan has outdone
      herself today. This is first-rate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's too strong a flavor of hare in it," said Magen-nis, critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's exactly its perfection; the wild savor lifts it out of the vulgar
      category of Irish stews, and assimilates it, but not too closely, to the
      ragout. I tell you, Mac, there's genius in the composition of that gravy."
    </p>
    <p>
      The partial pedantry of this speech was more than compensated for by the
      racy enjoyment of the speaker, and Magennis was really gratified at the
      zest with which his young friend relished his meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has one perfection, at least," said he, modestly,&mdash;"it 's very
      unlike what you get at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have a goodish sort of a cook," said Jack, languidly,&mdash;"a fellow
      my father picked up after the Congress of Verona. Truffles and treaties
      seem to have some strong sympathetic attraction, and when diplomacy had
      finished its work, a <i>chef</i> was to be had cheap! The worst of the
      class is, they 'll only functionate for your grand dinners and they leave
      your every-day meal to some inferior in the department."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was strange that Magennis could listen with interest always whenever
      Massingbred spoke of habits, people, and places with which he had never
      been conversant. It was not so much for the topics themselves he cared,&mdash;they
      were, in reality, valueless in his eyes,&mdash;it was some singular
      pleasure he felt in thinking that the man who could so discuss them was
      his own guest, seated at his own table, thus connecting himself by some
      invisible link with the great ones of this world!
    </p>
    <p>
      Massingbred's very name&mdash;the son of the celebrated Moore Massingbred&mdash;a
      Treasury Lord&mdash;Heaven knows what else besides&mdash;certainly a Right
      Honorable&mdash;was what first fascinated him in his young acquaintance,
      and induced him to invite him to his house. Jack would probably have
      declined the invitation, but it just came at the moment when he was deeply
      mortified at Nelligan's absence,&mdash;an absence which old Dan was
      totally unable to explain or account for. Indeed, he had forgotten that,
      in his note to his son, he had not mentioned Massingbred by name, and thus
      was he left to all the embarrassment of an apology without the slightest
      clew as to the nature of the excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner, then, was it apparent to Massingbred that young Nelligan did
      not intend to return home, than he decided on taking his own departure. At
      first he determined on going back to Dublin; but suddenly a malicious
      thought sprung up of all, the mortification it might occasion Joe to learn
      that he was still in the neighborhood; and with the amiable anticipation
      of this vengeance, he at once accepted Magennis's offer to "accompany him
      to his place in the mountains, and have some shooting."
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not have been easy to find two men so essentially unlike in every
      respect as these two, who now sat discussing their punch after dinner. In
      birth, bringing-up, habits, instincts, they were widely dissimilar, and
      yet, somehow, they formed a sort of companionship palatable to each. Each
      had something to tell the other which he had either not heard before, or
      not heard in the same way. We have already adverted to the strong
      fascination Magen-nis experienced in dwelling on the rank and social
      position of his young guest. Massingbred experienced no less delight in
      the indulgence of his favorite pastime,&mdash;adventure hunting. Now, here
      was really something like adventure,&mdash;this wild, rude mountain home,
      this strange compound of gloom and passion, this poor simple country girl,
      more than servant, less than wife,&mdash;all separated from the remainder
      of the world by a gulf wider than mere space. These were all ingredients
      more than enough to suggest matter for imagination, and food for
      after-thought in many a day to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had thus passed part of a week in company, when the incident occurred
      of which our last chapter makes mention, and an account of which, now,
      Massingbred proceeded to give his host, neither exaggerating nor
      diminishing in the slightest particular any portion of the event. He even
      repressed his habitual tendency to sarcasm, and spoke of his antagonist
      seriously and respectfully. "It was quite clear," said he, in conclusion,
      "that he did n't know I was a gentleman, and consequently never
      anticipated the consequence of a blow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he struck you?" broke in Magennis, violently.
    </p>

      "You shall see for yourself," said Jack, smiling, as, untying the
      handkerchief, he exhibited a deep cut on his forehead, from which the
      blood still continued to ooze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let Joan doctor you; she's wonderful at a cut. She has something they
      call Beggarman's Balsam. I 'll fetch her." And without waiting for a reply
      he left the room. The young woman speedily after appeared with some lint
      and a small pot of ointment, proceeding to her office with all the quiet
      assiduity of a practised hand, and a gentleness that few "regulars" could
      vie with. Her skill was more than recompensed by the few muttered words of
      praise Magennis bestowed, as he grumbled out, half to himself: "Old Cahill
      himself could n't do it better. I 'd back her for a bandage against the
      College of Surgeons. Ain't ye easier now?&mdash;to be sure you are. She 's
      good for <i>that</i> if she is for nothing else!" And even this much of
      eulogy made her bosom heave proudly, and brought a flush of joy over her
      cheek that was ecstasy itself.

      The world is not deficient in acts of kindness, benevolence, and
      good-will. There is a large fountain of these running in ten thousand
      rills. But how many more might there not be,&mdash;how much of this wealth
      might there not be dispensed, and nobody living one jot the poorer! How
      many are there toiling away in obscurity and narrow fortune, to whom one
      single word of praise&mdash;one chance syllable of encouragement&mdash;would
      be life's blood! What sunken cheeks and lacklustre eyes would glow and
      gladden again by even a look of sympathy, withheld from no lack of
      kindliness, but mere want of thought! Oh ye who have station and fame,
      genius or greatness, bethink ye that these gifts are never higher than
      when they elevate the humble and cheer the lowly, and there is no
      physician like him who animates the drooping heart, and gives new vigor to
      wearied faculties and failing energy. Joan was made happy by the two or
      three words of grateful thanks Massingbred addressed to her, and stole
      quietly away, leaving the two companions once more alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there was any incident in life participation in which could convey
      intense gratification to Magennis, it was that sort of difference or
      misunderstanding that might lead to a duel. Whenever the affair offered no
      other alternative, his delight was unbounded. There were, it was rumored
      events in his own early life which would imply that the taste for mortal
      combat extended only to cases where his friends were concerned, and had no
      selfish application whatever. Of these we know nothing; nor, indeed, have
      we any information to convey regarding him, save by chance and stray words
      dropped by himself in the unguarded hours of after-dinner converse. There
      are, however, many who like the subordinate parts in this world's comedy,&mdash;who
      would rather be best man than bridegroom, and infinitely prefer performing
      second to principal.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not, however, going into the inquiry as to the cause; enough when
      we repeat that this was Magennis's great passion, and these were the kind
      of events for whose conduct and management he believed himself to possess
      the most consummate tact and ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 're in luck, Massingbred," cried he, as the other concluded his
      recital,&mdash;"you're in luck, sir, to have for your friend one that,
      though I say it myself, has n't his equal for a case like this in the
      three kingdoms. It was I, sir, took out Cahill when he shot Major Harris,
      of the Fusiliers. I handled him that morning in a way that made the
      English officers confess there was no chance against us! A duel seems an
      easy thing to arrange. You 'd say that any fool could put up two men,
      twelve or even ten paces asunder, and tell them to blaze away; and if that
      was all there was in it, it would be simple enough. But consider for a
      minute the real case, and just remember how much the nature of the ground,
      whether level or uneven, has to do with it; what's behind,&mdash;if a
      wall, or trees, or only sky; the state of the light; how the sun stands;
      whether there 's wind, and what way it's coming. These are not all.
      There's the pistols,&mdash;how they <i>'throw,'</i> and with what charge;
      and then there 's the size of your man. Ay, Massingbred, and let me tell
      you, you now see before you the man that invented the 'invulnerable
      position.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove! that's a most valuable fact to me just now," said Jack, helping
      himself to a fresh tumbler. "I 'm glad you have not been retained by the
      other side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The 'invulnerable position'!" continued Magennis, perfectly heedless of
      the other's remark; while, taking up the poker, he stalked out to the
      middle of the room, drawing himself up to his full height, and presenting,
      as though with a pistol,&mdash;"Do you see what I mean?" cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't say I do," said Jack, hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought not," rejoined the other, proudly; "nobody ever did that was
      n't 'out' often. Pay attention now, and I 'll explain it. My head, you
      perceive, is carried far behind my right shoulder, so as to be completely
      protected by my pistol-hand and the pistol. I say the pistol, because it
      has been proved scientifically that the steadiest eye that ever fired
      never could aim at the antagonist's pistol. Morris Crofton practised it
      for eight years in his own garden; and though he did succeed, he told me
      that for practical purposes it was no use. Now we come to the neck, and
      you may observe the bend of my elbow. Ay, that little angle that nobody
      would remark masks the jugular arteries, and all the other vital nerves in
      that part. John Toler used to say that the head and neck was like the
      metropolis, and that a shot elsewhere was only like a 'row' in the
      provinces; and a very true and wise remark it was. Not that I neglect the
      trunk," added he, proudly; "for you see how I stand,&mdash;three-quarters
      of the back towards the enemy so as not to expose the soft parts. As for
      the legs," cried he, contemptuously, "let them crack at them as long as
      they like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that 's the 'invulnerable position,'" said Massing-bred; with less
      enthusiasm, however, than the discovery might seem to warrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, sir; and if it was n't for it there 's many a strapping fellow
      walking about this day-that would be lying with a marble counterpane over
      him. Billy Welsh, that fought Brian of Deanstown, was the first man I ever
      'put up' in it. Billy had a slight crick of the neck, and could n't get
      the head far enough round to the right, and the ball took him in the
      bridge of the nose, and carried that feature clean off, but never damaged
      him in any other respect whatever!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must say that the loss was quite sufficient for a man who had the
      benefit of the 'invulnerable position,'" said Massingbred, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He thinks nothing of it. A chap in the Crow Street Theatre made him a
      better nose than ever he had, out of wax, I believe; and he has a winter
      one, with a blush of red on it, to make believe it was cold; and they tell
      me you 'd never discover it was n't his own."
    </p>
    <p>
      Magennis had now resumed his place at table, and seemed bent on making up
      for lost time by giving double measure of whiskey to his punch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say that he's to be in Oughterard to-night; well, with the blessing
      of the Virgin,"&mdash;an invocation he invariably applied to every act of
      dubious morality,&mdash;"we 'll be with him before he's out of bed
      to-morrow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish he had not given me a blow," said Jack, musingly. "He seemed such
      a stout-hearted, spirited old fellow, I'm really grieved to quarrel with
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad that there's nobody to hear them words but myself, Mr.
      Massingbred," said the other, with all the slowness and deliberation of
      incipient drunkenness; "I'm rejoiced, sir, that it's in the confidential
      intercourse of friendly&mdash;friendly&mdash;communication&mdash;that the
      son of my old and valued friend&mdash;Moore Massingbred&mdash;used
      expressions like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack started with amazement at this speech; he had not the slightest
      suspicion till that moment that Magennis and his father had ever known
      each other, or even met. A very little patience, however, on his part
      served to solve the difficulty; for he discovered that one of the
      peculiarities of this stage of his friend's ebriety was to fancy himself
      the intimate and associate of any one whose name he had ever heard
      mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, sir, them's words your father would never have uttered. I was with
      him in his first blaze. 'Moore,' says I, 'have n't you a pair of black
      breeches?'&mdash;he wore a pair of web 'tights' of a light pattern&mdash;What
      are you laughing at, sir?" cried he, sternly, and striking the table with
      his clenched knuckles, till the glasses all rang on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was laughing at my father's costume," said Jack, who really told the
      truth; such a portrait of his parent's appearance being manifestly unlike
      anything he had ever imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the worse manners yours, sir," rejoined Magennis, rudely. "I' ll not
      suffer any man to laugh at an old friend&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;schoolfellow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with the very greatest difficulty that Jack could restrain himself
      at this peroration, which indignation&mdash;the same, probably, that
      creates poets&mdash;had suggested. He had, however, tact enough to
      preserve his gravity, whilst he assured his companion that no unfilial
      sentiment had any share in his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So far, so well," said Magennis, who now helped himself to the whiskey,
      unadulterated by any water; "otherwise, sir, it's not Lieutenant Magennis,
      of the&mdash;9th Foot, would handle you on the ground to-morrow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, then, you've served, Mac? Why, you never broke that to me before!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Broke!" cried the other, with a voice shrill from passion, while he made
      an effort to rise from his chair, and sunk back again,&mdash;"broke; who
      dares to say I was broke? I left the scoundrels myself. I shook the dust
      off my feet after them. There never was a court-martial about it. Never&mdash;never!"
      To the deep crimson that suffused his face before, there now succeeded an
      almost death-like pallor, and Massingbred really felt terrified at the
      change. Some heart-rending recollection seemed suddenly to have cleared
      his brain, routing in an instant all the effects of intoxication, and
      restoring him to sobriety and sorrow together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," said he, in a low, broken voice, and still speaking to himself,
      "that finished me! I never held my head up again! Who could, after such a
      business? I came here, Mr. Massingbred," continued he, but addressing his
      guest in a tone of deep respect,&mdash;"I came back here a ruined man, and
      not eight-and-twenty! You see me now, a dirty, drunken sot, not better
      dressed nor better mannered than the commonest fellow on the road, and yet
      I'm a gentleman born and bred, well nurtured, and well educated. I took a
      college degree and went into the army." He paused, as if trying to gather
      courage to go on; the effort was more than he could accomplish, and, as
      the heavy tears stole slowly down his cheeks, the agony of the struggle
      might be detected. Half mechanically he seized the decanter of whiskey and
      poured the tumbler nearly full; but Jack good-humoredly stretched out his
      hand towards the glass, and said, "Don't drink, Mac; there's no head could
      stand it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think so, boy," cried he, with a saucy smile. "Little you know the
      way we live in the West, here;" and he tossed off the liquor before the
      other could stop him. The empty glass had scarcely been replaced on the
      table, when all the former signs of drunkenness had come back again, and
      in his bloodshot eyes and swollen veins might be seen the very type of
      passionate debauch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not ask me to their houses!" cried he, hoarse with passion. "Who wants
      them? Not invite me! Did I ever seek them? The dirty, mean spalpeens,
      don't I know the history of every one of them? Could n't I expose them
      from one end of the county to the other? Who 's Blake of Harris-town? He
      's the son of Lucky Magarry, the pedler. You don't believe me. I had it
      from Father Cole himself. Lucky was hanged at Ennis. 'Ye want a
      confession!' says Lucky, when he came out on the drop; 'ye want a
      confession! Well, I suppose there's no use in keeping anything back now,
      for ye 'll hang me at any rate, and so here it's for you. It was I
      murdered Mr. Shea, and there was nobody helping me at all. I did it all
      myself with a flail; and be the same token, it 's under Mark Bindon's
      tombstone this minute. There now, the jury may be azy in their minds, and
      the judge, and the hangman, too, if he cares about it. As for his honor
      the high sheriff,' said he, raising his voice, 'he 's a fine man, God
      bless him, and the county may be proud of him; for it was he ferreted out
      all about this business! And faix, notwithstanding all, I 'm proud of him
      myself, for he 's my own son!' And as he said that he dropped on his knees
      and cried out that he might never see glory if there was a word of lie in
      anything he said then! So that's what Blake got for his zeal for justice!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And as Magennis finished, he burst into a wild, fiendish laugh, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "There 's the country gentry&mdash;there 's the people won't know Magennis
      and his wife!&mdash;ay, sir, his lawful, married wife! Let me see that you
      or any other man will deny it, or refuse to treat her as becomes her
      station.&mdash;Joan! Joan!" shouted he, striking the poker violently
      against the chimney; and with hot haste and intense anxiety the poor girl
      rushed into the room the moment after. "Sit down here, ma'am," said
      Magennis, rising, and placing a chair for her beside his own, with an
      affectation of courtesy that savored of mockery,&mdash;"sit down, I say,"
      cried he, stamping his foot passionately. "That's my wife, sir! No man
      that sits at <i>my</i> board shall behave to her as anything else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have ever treated her with respect," said Massingbred, "and shall
      always continue to do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it's better for you to do so," said the other, fiercely, the bullying
      spirit rising on what he deemed the craven submission of his guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the girl sat trembling with terror, not knowing what the scene
      portended, or how it was to end.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The herd's daughter, indeed! No, sir, Mrs. Magennis, of Barnagheela,
      that's her name and title!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words the poor girl, overcome with joy and gratitude, fell down
      upon her knees before him, and, clasping his hand, covered it with kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is n't that pretty breeding!" cried Magennis, violently. "Get up, ma'am,
      and sit on your chair like a lady. The devil a use in it, do what you
      will, say what you will,&mdash;the bad 'drop' is in them; and whatever
      becomes of you in life, Massingbred, let me give you this advice,&mdash;never
      marry beneath you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack contrived at this juncture to signal to the girl to step away; and by
      appearing to attend with eagerness to Magennis, he prevented his remarking
      her exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man 's never really ruined till then," continued he, slowly, and
      evidently sobering again as he went on. "Friends fall away from you, and
      your companions are sure to be fellows with something against them! You
      begin by thinking you 're doing a grand and a courageous thing! You string
      up your resolution to despise the world, and, take my word for it, the
      world pays you off at last. Ay," said he, after a long pause, in which his
      features settled down into an expression of deep sorrow, and his voice
      quivered with emotion,&mdash;"ay, and I 'll tell you something worse than
      all,&mdash;you revenge all your disappointment on the poor girl that
      trusted you! and you break <i>her</i> heart to try and heal your own!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With these last words he buried his head between his hands and sobbed
      fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave me now,&mdash;leave me alone," said he, without lifting his head.
      "Good-night&mdash;good-night to you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Massingbred arose without a word, and, taking a candle, ascended to his
      chamber, his last thoughts about his host being very unlike those with
      which he had first regarded him. From these considerations he turned to
      others more immediately concerning himself; nor could he conquer his
      misgivings that Magennis was a most unhappy selection for a friend in such
      an emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then I really am without a choice," said he to himself. "Joe
      Nelligan, perhaps, might&mdash;but no, he would have been infinitely more
      unfit than the other. At all events, Nelligan has himself severed the
      friendship that once existed between us." And so he wandered on to
      thoughts of his former companionship with him. Regretful and gloomy enough
      were they, as are all memories of those in whose hearts we once believed
      we had a share, and from which we cannot reconcile ourselves to the
      exclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He had not the manliness to meet me when I had become aware of his real
      station! What a poor-spirited fellow! Just as if I cared what or who his
      father was! <i>My</i> theory is, Jack Massingbred can afford to know any
      man he pleases! Witness the roof that now shelters me, and the character
      of him who is my host!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a philosophy he built much upon, for it was a form of self-love
      that simulated a good quality, many of his acquaintances saying, "At all
      events, there 's no snobbery about Massingbred; he 'll know, and even be
      intimate with, anybody." Nor did the deception only extend to others. Jack
      himself fancied he was an excellent fellow,&mdash;frank, generous, and
      open-hearted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a very strange fact&mdash;and fact it certainly is&mdash;that the
      men who reason most upon their own natures, look inwardly at their own
      minds, and scrutinize most their own motives, are frequently the least
      natural of all mankind! This self-inquiry is such thorough self-deception
      that he who indulges in it often becomes an actor. As for Massingbred,
      there was nothing real about him save his egotism! Gifted with very good
      abilities, aided by a strong "vitality," he had great versatility; but of
      all powers, this same plastic habit tends most to render a man artificial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, his present difficulty was by no means to his taste. He did not like
      his "quarrel;" he liked less the age and station of his adversary; and
      least of all was he pleased with the character of his "friend." It was
      said of Sheridan, that when consulted about the music of his operas, he
      only asked, "Will it grind?"&mdash;that is, would it be popular enough for
      a street organ, and become familiar to every ear? So Jack Massingbred
      regarded each event in life by the test of how it would "tell," in what
      wise could a newspaper report it, and how would it read in the Clubs? He
      fancied himself discussing the adventure at "White's," and asking, "Can
      any one say what Massingbred's row was about? Was he poaching?&mdash;or
      how came he there? Was there a woman in it? And who is his friend
      Magennis?" In thoughts like these he passed hour after hour, walking his
      room from end to end, and waiting for morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he bethought him how little likely it was that Magennis would
      remember anything whatever of the transaction, and that his late debauch
      might obliterate all memory of the affair. "What if this were to be the
      case, and that we were to arrive too late at Oughterard? A pretty version
      would the papers then publish to the world!" Of all possible casualties
      this was the very worst; and the more he reflected on it, the more
      probable did it seem. "He is the very fellow to wake up late in the
      afternoon, rub his eyes, and declare he had forgotten the whole thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This will never do!" muttered he to himself; and at once determined that
      he would make an endeavor to recall his friend to consciousness, and come
      to some arrangement for the approaching meeting. Massingbred descended the
      stairs with noiseless steps, and gently approaching the door of the
      sitting-room, opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magennis was asleep, his head resting upon the table, and his heavy
      breathing denoting how deeply he slumbered. On a low stool at his feet sat
      Joan, pale and weary-looking, her cheeks still marked with recent tears,
      and the dark impression of what seemed to have been a blow beneath her
      eye. Jack approached her cautiously, and asked if it were his custom to
      pass the night thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes, when he 's tired&mdash;when he has anything on his mind,"
      replied she, in some confusion, and averting her head so as to escape
      notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when he awakes," said Jack, "he will be quite refreshed, and his head
      all clear again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By coorse he will!" said she, proudly. "No matter what he took of a
      night, nobody ever saw the signs of it on him the next morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not ask out of any impertinent curiosity," continued Massingbred;
      "but we have, both of us, some rather important business to-morrow in
      Oughterard. We ought to be there at an early hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," said she, interrupting. "He bid me bring down these;" and she
      pointed to a case of pistols lying open beside her, and in cleaning which
      she had been at the moment engaged. "I brought the wrong ones, first."
      Here she stammered out something, and grew crimson over her whole face;
      then suddenly recovering herself, said, "I did n't know it was the
      'Terries' he wanted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The 'Terries'?" repeated Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir. It was these Terry Callaghan shot the two gentlemen with, the
      same morning, at Croghaglin,&mdash;father and son they were!" And saying
      these words in a voice of the most perfect unconcern possible, she took up
      a flannel rag and began to polish the lock of one of the weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They 're handsome pistols," said Jack, rather amused with her remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They 're good, and that's better!" replied she, gravely. "That one in
      your hand has seven double crosses on the stock and nine single."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The seven were killed on the ground, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A short nod of assent was her reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such little events are not unfrequent down here, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anan!" said she, not understanding his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack quickly perceived that he had not taken sufficient account of Joan's
      limited acquaintance with language, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "They often fight in these parts?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ayeh! not now," replied she, in a half-deploring tone. "My father
      remembers twenty duels for one that does be nowadays."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A great change, indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some say it's all for the better," resumed she, doubtfully. "But hush,&mdash;he's
      stirring; leave him quiet, and I 'll call you when he's ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I can depend&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure you can. He forgets many a thing; but no man living can say
      that he ever misremembered a duel." And with these words, in a low
      whisper, she motioned Massingbred to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack obeyed in silence, and, ascending to his room, lay down on the bed.
      He determined to pass the interval before morning in deep thought and
      self-examination; but, somehow, he had scarcely laid his head on the
      pillow when he fell off into a heavy sleep, sound and dreamless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was just breaking when he was aroused by a somewhat rude shake,
      and a voice saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, up with you. We 've a sharp ride before us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack started up, and in an instant recalled all the exigencies of the
      hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have sent the 'tools' forward by a safe hand," continued Magennis; "and
      Joan has a cup of tea ready for us below stairs. So lose no time now, and
      let us be off."
    </p>
    <p>
      The humble meal that awaited them was soon despatched, and they were
      speedily mounted on the pair of mountain ponies Magennis had provided, and
      whose equipments, even in the half-light of the morning, rather shocked
      Mas-singbred's notions of propriety,&mdash;one of his stirrup-leathers
      being a foot shorter than the other, while an old worsted bell-rope formed
      the snaffle-rein of his bridle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road, too, was rugged and precipitous, and many a stumble and scramble
      had they in the uncertain light; while the swooping rain dashed violently
      against them, and effectually precluded all thought of conversation. Two
      hours, that seemed like ten, brought them at length upon the highroad;
      after which, by a brisk canter of forty minutes, they reached Oughterard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us dismount here," said Jack, as they gained the outskirts of the
      town, not fancying to make a public appearance on his humble steed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?" answered Magennis. "It's ashamed of the pony you are! Oh, for
      the matter of that, don't distress yourself; we 're too well used to them
      in these parts to think them ridiculous."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a soreness and irritation in his tone which Jack quickly
      remarked, and as quickly tried to obviate, by some good-natured remark
      about the good qualities of the animals; but Magennis heard him without
      attention, and seemed entirely immersed in his own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Turn in there, to your left," cried he, suddenly, and they wheeled into
      an arched gateway that opened upon the stable-yard of the inn. Early as it
      was, the place was full of bustle and movement; for it was the market-day,
      and the farmers were already arriving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carts, cars, gigs, and a dozen other nameless vehicles crowded the spot,
      with kicking ponies and mules of malicious disposition; grooming and
      shoeing and unharnessing went on, with a noise and merriment that was
      perfectly deafening; and Massingbred, as he threaded his way through the
      crowd, soon perceived how little notice he was likely to attract in such
      an assembly. Magennis soon dismounted, and having given directions about
      the beasts, led Jack into the house, and up a narrow, creaking stair into
      a small room, with a single window, and a bed in one corner. "This is
      where I always put up," said he, laying down his hat and whip, "and it
      will do well enough for the time we 'll want it."

      CHAPTER XVI. "A CHALLENGE"
    </h2>
    <p>
      "He 's here; he arrived last night," said Magennis, as he entered the room
      after a short exploring tour through the stables, the kitchen, and every
      other quarter where intelligence might be come at. "He came alone; but the
      major of the detachment supped with him, and that looks like business!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The earlier you see him the better, then," said Mas-singbred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll just go and get my beard off," said he, passing his hand across a
      very grizzly stubble, "and I'll be with him in less than half an hour.
      There's only a point or two I want to be clear about. Before he struck
      you, did you gesticulate, or show any intention of using violence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None. I have told you that I caught his horse by the bridle, but that was
      to save him from falling back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that was indiscreet, at all events."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would n't it have been worse to suffer him to incur a severe danger which
      I might have prevented?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think so; but we'll not discuss the point now. There was a blow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That there was," said Jack, pointing to the spot where a great strap of
      sticking-plaster extended across his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he seemed to understand at once that reparation was to be made for
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The suggestion came from himself, frankly and speedily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's pretty evident we have to deal with a gentleman!" said
      Magennis, "and that same's a comfort; so I'll leave you now for a short
      time: amuse yourself as well as you can, but don't quit the room." And
      with this caution Magennis took his departure, and set off in search of
      Mr. Repton's chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you bringing the mutton chops, Peter?" said he to a waiter,
      who, with a well-loaded tray of eatables, was hastening along the
      corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the ould Counsellor from Dublin, sir. He's break-fastin' with the
      Major."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that's his room, No. 19?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They 're merry, at all events," said Magennis, as a burst of hearty
      laughter was heard from within the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'T is just that they are, indeed," replied Peter. "The Counsellor does be
      telling one story after another, till you 'd think he 'd no end of them.
      He began last night at supper, and I could scarce change the plates for
      laughin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      Muttering some not very intelligible observation to himself, Magennis
      passed down the stairs, and issuing into the street, wended his way to the
      barber's.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Oughterard Figaro had not as brilliant a vocation as his colleague
      of Seville, his occupations were scarcely less multifarious, for he kept
      the post-office, was clerk at petty sessions, collected the parish cess,
      presided over "the pound," besides a vast number of inferior duties.
      Whether it was the result of a natural gift, or by the various information
      of his official life, Hosey Lynch was regarded in his native town as a
      remarkably shrewd man, and a good opinion on a number of subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a short, decrepit old fellow, with an enormous head of curly black
      hair, which he seemed to cultivate with all the address of his craft;
      probably intending it as a kind of advertisement of his skill, displaying
      as it did all the resources of his handiwork. But even above this passion
      was his ardor for news,&mdash;news political, social, legal, or literary;
      whatever might be the topic, it always interested him, and it was his
      especial pride to have the initiative of every event that stirred the
      hearts of the Oughterard public.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small den in which he performed his functions occupied the corner of
      the street, giving a view in two directions, so that Hosey, while cutting
      and curling, never was obliged to lose sight of that world without, in
      whose doings he felt so strong an interest. In the one easy-chair of this
      sanctum was Magennis now disposed, waiting for Mr. Lynch, who had just
      stepped down to "the pound," to liberate the priest's pig. Nor had he long
      to wait, for Hosey soon made his appearance, and slipping on a very
      greasy-looking jean-jacket, proceeded to serve him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The top of the morning to you, Captain,"&mdash;he always styled him by
      the title,&mdash;"it's a rare pleasure to see you so early in town; but it
      will be a bad market to-day&mdash;cut and curled, Captain?"
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      "No; shaved!" said Magennis, bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And shaved you shall be, Captain,&mdash;and beautifully shaved, too, for
      I have got an excellent case from Lamprey's; they came yesterday,&mdash;came
      with the writ against Jones Creegan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At whose suit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Miles Creegan, the other brother's widow," said Hosey, lathering
      away and talking with breathless rapidity. "There was a clause in old
      Sam's will, that if ever Tom, the chap that died at Demerara&mdash;you'd
      like more off the whiskers, it's more military. It was only yesterday
      Major Froode remarked to me what a soldierlike-looking man was Captain
      Magennis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he in command of the detachment?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is in his Majesty's&mdash;1st Foot&mdash;the 'Buccaneers,' they used
      to be called; I suppose you never heard why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, nor don't want to hear. What kind of a man is the Major?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He 's a smart, well-made man, with rather a haughty look," said Hosey,
      drawing himself up, and seeming to imply that there was a kind of
      resemblance between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he English or Irish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scotch, Captain,&mdash;Scotch; and never gives more than fivepence for a
      cut and curl, pomatum included.&mdash;No letters, Mrs. Cronin," cried he,
      raising up the movable shutter of the little window; then bending down his
      ear he listened to some whispered communication from that lady, after
      which he shut the panel, and resumed his functions. "She 's at law with
      O'Reilly about the party wall. There's the Major now going down to the
      barracks, and I wonder who's the other along with him;" and Hosey rushed
      to the door to find some clew to the stranger. In less than a quarter of a
      minute he was back again, asking pardon for absence, and informing
      Magennis "that the man in plain clothes was a Dublin counsellor, that
      arrived the night before. I think I can guess what he's here for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" cried Magennis, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's an election coming on, and the Martins expect a contest.&mdash;Nothing
      for you, Peter," said he, to an applicant for a letter outside. "He's
      looking to be made barony constable these four years, and he 's as much
      chance as I have of being&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you done?" asked Magennis, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One minute more, sir&mdash;the least touch round the chin,&mdash;and, as
      I was saying, Captain, the Martins will lose the borough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who thinks so besides you?" asked Magennis, gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, I may say, the general opinion; the notion current in&mdash; There
      's Miss Martin herself," cried he, running to the window. "Well, really,
      she handles them ponies elegant!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does she come often into town?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think I saw her in Oughterard&mdash;let me see when it was&mdash;it's
      two years&mdash;no, but it's not far off&mdash;it's more than&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you done?" said Magennis, impatiently. "I told you that I was pressed
      for time this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're finished now, Captain," said Hosey, presenting him with a small
      cracked looking-glass. "That's what I call a neat chin and a beautiful
      sweep of whisker. Thank you, Captain. It's a pleasure and an honor&mdash;not
      to say that it's&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Magennis did not wait for the peroration, but striding hastily out of the
      little shop, issued into the street that led to the inn. On arriving
      there, he heard that Mr. Rep-ton had gone out, leaving word that he would
      be found at Major Froode's quarters. Thither Magennis now repaired with
      all the solemn importance befitting his mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sent in his name, he could overhear the short colloquy that passed
      within, and perceived that Repton was about to retire; and now the servant
      ushered him into the presence of a smart, light-whiskered little man, with
      a pair of shrewd gray eyes, and a high forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A brother officer, I perceive, sir," said he, looking at the card,
      whereupon the title Captain was inscribed; "pray take a chair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You anticipate the reason of this visit, Major Froode," said the other,
      with some degree of constraint, as though the preliminaries were the
      reverse of pleasant to him. The Major bowed, and Magennis went on: "I
      suppose, then, I'm to treat with you as the friend of Mr. Valentine
      Repton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are Mr. Massingbred's?" said the Major, answering the question
      with another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have that honor, sir," said Magennis, pompously; "and now, sir, how
      soon can it come off?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you imagine, Captain Magennis, that a little quiet discussion of
      the question at issue between two old soldiers, like you and myself, might
      possibly be advisable? Is there not a chance that our united experience
      might not suggest an amicable arrangement of this business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite out of the question,&mdash;utterly, totally impossible!" said
      Magennis, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then perhaps I lie under some misconception," said the Major,
      courteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was a blow, sir!&mdash;a blow!" said Magennis, in the same stern
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I opine that everything that occurred was purely accidental,&mdash;just
      hear me out,&mdash;that a hasty word and a hurried gesture, complicated
      with the impatient movement of a horse&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      A long whistle from Magennis interrupted the speech, and the Major,
      reddening to the very top of his high forehead, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, this is unbecoming,&mdash;are you aware of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm quite ready for anything when this is settled," said Magennis, but
      with less composure than he desired to assume. "What I meant was, that for
      a blow there is but one reparation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doubtless, if the injury admit of no explanation," said the Major,
      calmly; "but in that lies the whole question. Consider two things, Captain
      Magennis: first of all, the equivocal appearance of <i>your</i> friend,
      the age and standing of <i>mine</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove! you'll kill me in trying to save my life," said Repton, bursting
      into the room. "I didn't want to play eavesdropper, Froode, but these thin
      partitions are only soundboards for the voice. This gentleman," added he,
      turning to Magennis, "is perfectly correct. There was a blow; and a blow
      has only one consequence, and that one I 'm ready for. There may be, for
      aught I know, twenty ways of settling these matters in London or at the
      clubs, but we 're old-fashioned in our notions in Ireland here; and I
      don't think that even when we pick up new fashions that we 're much the
      better for them, so that if your friend is here, Captain, and ready&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both, sir; here and ready!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then so am I; and now for the place. Come, Froode, you don't know Ireland
      as well as I do; just humor me this time, and whenever I get into a scrape
      in Scotland you shall have it all your own way. Eh, Captain, is n't that
      fair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spoke like a trump!" muttered Magennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For <i>me</i>, did you say?" said Repton, taking a letter from the
      servant, who had just entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; and the groom says there's an answer expected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The devil take it, I 've forgotten my spectacles. Froode, just tell me
      what's this about, and who it comes from."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Miss Martin's hand," said Froode, breaking the seal and running over
      the contents. "Oh, I perceive," said he; "they're afraid you have taken
      French leave of them at Cro' Martin, and she has driven into town to carry
      you back again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That comes of my leaving word at the little post-office to forward my
      letters to Dublin if not asked for to-morrow. Take a pen, Froode, and
      write a couple of lines for me; say that a very urgent call&mdash;a
      professional call&mdash;will detain me here to-day, but that if not back
      by dinner-time&mdash;Captain Magennis thinks it not likely," added he,
      turning towards him as he sat, with a very equivocal expression, half
      grin, half sneer, upon his features&mdash;"that I 'll be with them at
      breakfast next morning," resumed Repton, boldly. "Make some excuse for my
      not answering the note myself,&mdash;whatever occurs to you. And so, sir,"
      said he, turning to Magennis, "your friend's name is Massingbred. Any
      relation to Colonel Moore Massingbred?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His son,&mdash;his only son, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How strange! I remember the father in the 'House'&mdash;I mean the Irish
      House&mdash;five-and-thirty years ago; he was always on the Government
      benches. It was of him Parsons wrote those doggerel lines,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'A man without a heart or head,
     Who seldom thought, who never read,
     A witty word who never said,
     One at whose board none ever fed,
     Such is the Colonel M&mdash;g&mdash;b&mdash;d.'
</pre>
    <p>
      He could n't call him a coward, though; for when they went out&mdash;which
      they did&mdash;Massingbred's manner on the ground was admirable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will that do?" said Froode, showing a few lines he had hastily jotted
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't read a word of it, but of course it will," said he; "and then,
      sir," added he, addressing Magennis, "the sooner we place ourselves at
      your disposal the better."
    </p>
    <p>
      Froode whispered something in Repton' ear, and by his manner seemed as if
      remonstrating with him, when the other said aloud,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "We 're in Ireland, Major; and, what's more, we 're in Galway, as
      Macleweed said once to a prisoner, 'With a Yorkshire jury, sir, I 'd hang
      you. Your sentence now is to pay five marks to the King, and find bail for
      your good behavior.' You see what virtue there is in locality."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a neat spot about two miles off, on the road to Maum," said
      Magennis to the Major. "We could ride slowly forward, and you might keep
      us in view."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what direction did you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take the second turn out of the market-place till you pass the baker's
      shop, then to the left, and straight on afterwards. You can't miss it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop a moment, sir," said Froode to Magennis, as he moved towards the
      door; "one word, if you please. It is distinctly understood that I have
      been overruled in this business,&mdash;that, in fact, I have submitted&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your point has been reserved," said Repton, laughing, while he led him
      away; and Magennis at the same moment took his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, indeed, with no slight feeling of triumph that thia gentleman now
      hastened back to the Martin Arms. Never did a great diplomatist experience
      more pride in the conclusion of some crowning act of negotiation than did
      he in the accomplishment of this affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There 's many a man," said he to himself, "who 'd have accepted an
      apology here. There's many a man might have let himself be embarrassed by
      the circumstances; for, certainly, the taking hold of the bridle was an
      awkward fact, and if the Major was a cute fellow he 'd have made a stand
      upon it. I must say that the Counsellor showed no backwardness; he comes
      of that fine old stock we used to have before the Union."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with this profound reflection he entered the room where Massingbred
      sat awaiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all settled. We're to meet at the Priest's Gap within an hour," said
      Magennis, with the air of a man who had acquitted himself cleverly. "And
      though I say it that should n't, if you were in other hands this morning
      you would n't have got your shot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I always relied implicitly upon your skill!" said Massingbred, humoring
      his vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you anything to arrange,&mdash;a letter or so to write; for I'll
      step down to Dr. Hearkins to tell him to follow us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Massingbred made no reply as the other left the room. Once more alone, he
      began to think gravely over his present situation. Nor could all his
      habitual levity steel him against the conviction that five minutes of
      common-sense talk might arrange a dispute which now promised a serious
      ending. "However," thought he, "we are not in the land where such
      differences admit of amicable solution, and there's no help for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      A sharp tap at the door startled him from these musings, and before he
      could well reply to it Daniel Nelligan entered the room, and advanced
      towards him with an air of mingled ease and constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you 'll forgive me, Mr. Massingbred," he began. "I feel certain
      that you will at some future day, at least, for what I 'm going to do."
      Here he stopped and drew a long breath, as if not knowing in what terms to
      continue. Massingbred handed him a chair, and took one in front of him
      without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know what brought you here to-day; I am aware of it all."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and waited for the other to speak; but Massingbred sat without
      offering a word, and evidently relying on his own social tact to confound
      and embarrass his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, sir, that you are likely to regard my interference as
      impertinent," resumed Nelligan; "but I trust that the friend of my son,
      Joe&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must set you right upon one point, at least, Mr. Nelligan," said
      Massingbred, with an easy smile. "If you be only as accurate in your
      knowledge of my affairs as you are with respect to my private friendships,
      this visit has certainly proceeded from some misconception. Your son and I
      were friends once upon a time. We are so no longer!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never heard of this. I never knew you had quarrelled!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have not, sir. We have not even met. The discourtesy he has shown me
      since my arrival here&mdash;his avoidance of me, too marked to be
      explained away&mdash;is an offence. The only misfortune is that it is one
      which can be practised with impunity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son asks for none such," said Dan, fiercely. "And if your observation
      is meant for an insult&mdash;" He stopped suddenly, as if checked by
      something within, and then said, but in a voice full and measured, "I'm
      magistrate of this town, sir, and I come here upon information that has
      reached me of your intentions to commit a breach of the peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Mr. Nelligan," began Massingbred, in his most seductive of
      manners,&mdash;but the other had already witnessed the rupture of the only
      tie which bound them, the supposed friendship between Joe and Massingbred,
      and cared nothing for all the blandishments he could bestow,&mdash;"my
      dear Mr. Nelligan, you cannot, surely, suppose that a mere stranger as I
      am in your county&mdash;scarcely ten days here&mdash;should have been
      unfortunate enough to have incurred the animosity of any one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hold here a statement, sir," said Nelligan, sternly, "which, if you
      please to pledge your honor to be incorrect&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this is Galway!" exclaimed Massingbred,&mdash;"this glorious land of
      chivalrous sentiment of which we poor Englishmen have been hearing to
      satiety! The Paradise of Point of Honor, then, turns out a very
      commonplace locality, after all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm proud to say that our county has another reputation than its old
      one; not but&mdash;" and he added the words in some temper&mdash;"there
      are a few left would like to teach you that its character was not acquired
      for nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well!" sighed Jack, as he closed his eyes, and appeared as if
      indulging in a revery, "of all the mockeries I have lived to see unmasked,
      this is the worst and meanest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not come here to listen to this, sir," said Nelli-gan, haughtily,
      as he arose. "I waited upon you, intending to accept your solemn pledge,
      by word of honor, to commit no act hostile to the public peace. Now, sir,
      I shall call upon you to give me the legal guarantee for this security,&mdash;good
      and sufficient bail, and that within an hour!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Mr. Nelligan," replied Massingbred, with all the quiet ease of an
      unruffled temper, "I have not a single friend here, except yourself, upon
      whom I could call in such an emergency. I am utterly unknown in these
      parts; my very name unheard of before my arrival. If I <i>did</i> by any
      unhappy circumstance find myself in such an involvement as you speak of, I
      solemnly assure you my first thought would be to address myself to Mr.
      Nelligan."
    </p>
    <p>
      The easy impertinence of this speech would have been perfectly successful
      a short time previous, when Nelligan yet believed in the close friendship
      with his son. It came now, however, too late, and the old man listened to
      it with something bordering on anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good and sufficient bail, sir,&mdash;yourself and two others," repeated
      he, slowly, and moving towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One word, I pray," said Jack, rising, and speaking with more earnestness
      and apparently with more sincerity. "I do not ask you any details as to
      the circumstances you impute to me, but perhaps you would, as a favor,
      tell me how this information has reached you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not, sir," was the abrupt reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure no friend of mine could have&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is no use, Mr. Massingbred; all your address will avail you nothing.
      You shall not cross-examine <i>me!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must, however, see, sir," said Massingbred, "that unknown and
      unfriended as I am here, bail is out of the question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Bench will hear anything you desire to say on that subject," said
      Nelligan, coldly. "Good-morning to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with these words he left the room, and descended into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passionate warmth which Massingbred had so successfully controlled in
      the presence of his visitor burst forth the first moment he found himself
      alone. He inveighed against the country, the people, their habits, and all
      belonging to them; cursed his own fate at being ever thrown into such
      companionship; and wound up by resolving to submit to any terms by which
      he might quit Galway forever, and forget, for the rest of his days, that
      he had ever entered it. While he was yet fuming in this fashion, the
      waiter entered and presented him with a very dirty-looking note, fastened
      by two wafers, and inscribed "Most private." Massingbred opened it and
      read,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "My dear Mr. M.,&mdash;We 're found out&mdash;I believe by Hosey
     Lynch, where I dropped a bullet-mould this morning when he
     was shaving me. At all events, we 're blown, and as I am
     under £250 recognizances to keep the peace for three years,
     I 'm off to the mountains till this passes over. I 'm sure,
     from what I saw of the Counsellor, that he 'll keep himself
     open to a proposal elsewhere. Meanwhile, there's nothing for
     it but to give your bail and satisfy the blackguards&mdash;bad
     luck to them&mdash;that spoiled the sport! You can go back to
     the house when all's over, and I 'll return as soon as it is
     safe for

     "Your sincere friend,

     "T. M."
</pre>
    <p>
      Scarcely had he finished reading this epistle, when Major Froode presented
      himself in his chamber, the door of which the waiter was yet holding ajar.
      Having introduced himself, he briefly informed Massingbred of his position
      as Mr. Repton's friend, and as briefly stated that the Counsellor had been
      obliged to pledge himself against any hostile intentions,&mdash;a step
      which, he foresaw, would also be required of him. "For this reason I have
      come," continued he, "to say that any assistance I can be of to you is
      frankly at your service. I have learned that you are a stranger here, and
      not likely to have many acquaintances."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If they would be satisfied with my word," began Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course they will, and shall," interrupted Froode; "and now, what is
      there in the way of <i>amende</i> my friend can make, for what he is
      prepared to confess was a mere accident?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The acknowledgment is ample. I ask for nothing beyond it," said
      Massingbred. "I am not quite certain but that my own conduct might require
      a little explanation; but as your friend's vigor put matters beyond
      negotiation at the time, we 'll not go back upon bygones."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, sir," burst in Repton, who had waited outside the door,&mdash;"and
      now, sir, I beg you to accept the humblest apology I can tender for what
      has happened. I 'm not as safe on my saddle as I used to be forty years
      ago; and when the nag reared and threatened to fall back upon me, I am
      ashamed to own that I neither saw nor cared what I struck at. I 'd have
      said all this to you, Mr. Massingbred, after your fire, had we been
      permitted to go the ground; and although there is some additional
      humiliation in saying it here, I richly deserve all the pain it gives me,
      for my want of temper. Will you give me your hand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With sincere pleasure," said Jack, shaking him warmly and cordially with
      both his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There 's but one thing more to be done," said Repton. "These borough
      magistrates, vulgar dogs as they are, will want you to give a bail bond.
      Take no notice of them, but just drive out with me to Cro' Martin, and we
      'll settle it all there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not acquainted with Mr. Martin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you shall be. He 'll be charmed to know you, and the place is worth
      seeing. Come, you mustn't leave the West with only its barbarism in your
      memory. You must carry away some other recollections."
    </p>
    <p>
      The new turn affairs had just taken was by no means distasteful to
      Massingbred. It promised another scene in that drama of life he loved to
      fashion for himself, with new scenery, new actors, and new incidents. "The
      Counsellor," too, struck his fancy. There was a raciness in the old man's
      manner, a genial cordiality, united with such palpable acuteness, that he
      promised himself much pleasure in his society; and so he accepted the
      proposal with all willingness, and pledged to hold himself ready for his
      friend within an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repton and the Major had but just left the room, when the former
      re-entered it hurriedly, and said, "By the way, I must leave you to your
      own guidance to find your road to Cro' Martin, for there's a young lady
      below stairs has a lien upon me. You shall be presented to her when you
      come out, and I promise you it will repay the journey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This must be the Mary Martin I 've been hearing of," thought Massingbred,
      when again alone; "and so the morning's work will probably turn out better
      than I had anticipated."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. A COUNTRY-HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Massingbred arrived at Cro' Martin, he found Repton at the door
      awaiting him. "I find," said he, "there is little need of introducing you
      here. Your father was an old acquaintance of Martin's; they sat together
      for years in Parliament, and Lady Dorothea was related to your family. But
      here he comes." And Martin approached, with his hand extended in cordial
      welcome. No one ever knew better how to do the honors of his house, nor
      could throw more graceful courtesy into the first steps of
      acquaintanceship. Massingbred, too, was well calculated to appreciate this
      gift. He had a most intense esteem for "manner," and enjoyed even the
      necessity it imposed upon himself of exertion to please. With sincere
      satisfaction was it that he accepted an invitation to pass some days
      there, and at once despatched a servant to Magennis's house for his
      trunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The adventure of the morning was alluded to but once, and then in a
      jocular strain, as an incident of no moment whatever; and Massingbred
      retired to his room to dress for dinner, wondering within himself if he
      should find the other members of the family as much to his liking as the
      worthy host had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dinner-party was a rare event at Cro' Martin. The isolation in which
      they lived was rarely broken by a visitor; and when, by rare accident,
      some solitary stranger did present himself with a letter of introduction,
      his stay was merely of a few hours. Now, however, the company included, in
      addition to the family, Repton, Massingbred, and Nelligan, besides Miss
      Henderson, who was on that day to appear at dinner. The quondam college
      friends had not met; neither had Miss Martin ever seen her governess; so
      that there was no small degree of anticipation as to how such elements
      would harmonize and agree.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Massingbred entered the drawing-room, he found Miss Henderson there
      alone; and at once believing she could be no other than Miss Martin, he
      proceeded to introduce himself in the best manner he could. Her reception
      was perfect in ease and self-possession, and they soon found themselves
      engaged in a lively discussion as to the scenery, the people and their
      habits, of which they both appeared to have a very similar appreciation.
      Lady Dorothea next made her appearance; and, advancing towards
      Massingbred, welcomed him with what, for her, was the extreme of
      cordiality. "Your mother was a Caradoc, Mr. Massingbred, and the Caradocs
      are all of our family; so let me claim relationship at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      With all the pretensions of a very fine lady, Lady Dorothea knew how to
      unite very agreeable qualities, not the less successful in her
      captivations, that she never exercised them without a real desire to
      please; so that Massingbred soon saw how in the wilds of dreary Connemara
      there existed a little oasis of polish and civilization that would have
      done honor to the most splendid society of London or Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was Massingbred himself less pleasing to her. It was so long, so many,
      many years since she had met with one fresh from that great world which
      alone she valued!
    </p>
    <p>
      Correspondence had kept her to a certain extent informed upon the changes
      and vicissitudes of society,&mdash;the births, deaths, marriages,
      separations, quarrels, and other disasters of those dear friends for whose
      griefs absence and time offer so many consolations! But then, the actual
      appearance, the <i>coup d'oil</i> of that world could only be imparted by
      an observer, imbued with all the spirit that gives observation its
      peculiar piquancy. This she found in him; and so agreeably exercised was
      it, that she actually heard dinner announced without attending, and only
      as she arose from her seat was reminded to present him to Miss Martin, by
      the brief phrase, "My niece, Mr. Massingbred;" while she took his arm,
      with a glance at Mr. Repton, that plainly said, "You are deposed."
    </p>
    <p>
      The passage to the dinner-room lay through three spacious and splendid
      rooms, which now were brilliantly lighted up, and lined with servants in
      rich liveries,&mdash;a degree of state Massingbred was not a little
      pleased at; partly suspecting that it was intended to do himself honor. As
      they moved slowly through the last of these, the door suddenly opened, and
      young Nelligan entered. He had returned late from a long ride, and heard
      nothing whatever of Massing-bred's arrival. With an exclamation of "Jack&mdash;Massingbred!"
      he bounded forward. But the other showed no recognition of him; and
      directing Lady Dorothea's attention to the richness of a picture-frame,
      passed calmly on into the dinner-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must bring up the rear alone, Nelligan," said Martin, who had given
      his arm to Miss Henderson; and Joe followed, almost overwhelmed with
      mingled shame and amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant the possibility of mistake assuaged his sense of
      mortification; but no sooner did he find himself at table, and directly
      opposite to Massingbred, than he perceived there was no ground whatever
      for this consolation. It was, indeed, Massingbred, just as he had seen him
      the first day in the Commons Hall at dinner, and when his cold,
      supercilious manner had struck him so disagreeably.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a terrible vengeance for all the superiority Nelligan had displayed
      over him in the Examination Hall was Massingbred's present success; for
      success it was. With all that consummate readiness the habit of society
      imparts, Jack could talk well on a great variety of topics, and possessed,
      besides, that especial tact to make others so far participators in his
      observations that they felt a partnership in the agreeability. Lady
      Dorothea was perfectly charmed with him; it was the triumph, as it were,
      of one of her own set. His anecdotes&mdash;not very pointed or curious in
      themselves&mdash;had the marked characteristic of always referring to
      distinguished individuals; so that what was deficient in wit was more than
      compensated by the rank of the actors. Martin enjoyed his conversation
      with all his own complacent ease, and felt delighted with one who could
      play all the game without an adversary. Mary was pleased and astonished
      together&mdash;the pleasure being even less than the amazement&mdash;at
      all he seemed to know of life and the world, and how intimately one so
      young seemed to have mixed in society. As for Repton, he relished the
      other's powers with the true zest of a pleasant talker; they were of
      different styles, and no disagreeable rivalry marred the appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst all these silent or spoken testimonies sat poor Nelligan,
      overwhelmed with shame. Massingbred had refused to recognize him; and it
      was left to his own gloomy thoughts to search out the reason. At first Joe
      avoided meeting the other's look; he dreaded he knew not what of
      impertinence or insult, to which the time and place could offer no
      reparation; but gradually he grew to perceive that Massingbred's cold eye
      met his own without a spark of meaning; nor was there in voice, manner, or
      bearing, a single evidence of constraint or awkwardness to be detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Henderson alone seemed to listen to him with easy indifference; and
      more than once, when Jack put forth his most showy pretensions, he was
      secretly mortified to see how little impression he had made on the dark
      beauty with the haughty smile. This was exactly the kind of defiance that
      Massingbred never declined, and he determined within himself to attempt
      the conquest. As the party returned to the drawing-room, he asked Lady
      Dorothea to present him more formally to the young lady whose acquaintance
      he had dared to obtrude upon before dinner; but she coldly said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's no matter; she's only the governess." An explanation she deemed
      quite sufficient to subdue any rising feeling of interest regarding her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the gentleman who sat next her at dinner?" asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A neighbor,&mdash;that is, the son of one of our borough people. I have
      not introduced him to you; for, of course, you are not likely to meet
      again. As you were remarking, awhile ago, society in England is gradually
      undergoing that change which in France was accomplished in a year or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With the aid of the guillotine and the 'lanterne,'" said Jack, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so; they used sharp remedies for a quick cure. But I own to you that
      I have not yet reconciled myself, nor do I see how I shall ever reconcile
      myself, to intimacy with a class not only whose habits and instincts, but
      whose very natures are adverse to our own. That young man now, for
      instance, they speak of him as quite a college wonder. I'm ashamed to say
      I don't know wherein his great successes lie; but they tell me that he has
      distanced every competitor of his day, and stands alone in his
      preeminence, and yet we saw him to-day not venturing on a remark, nor even
      hazarding an opinion on the topics we talked of, and silent where he ought
      to have been heard with advantage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he bashful?" said Jack, with a lazy drawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think it's that; at least, not altogether."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supercilious, perhaps?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! certainly not," replied she, hastily. "The company in which he found
      himself is the best answer to that. He could not presume&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was, then, downright fear," broke in Massingbred; "the terror that
      even clever men cannot even shake off when thrown amongst a class they're
      unused to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And very naturally so. I'm sure he must be puzzled to imagine why he is
      here. Indeed, we have only known him a few days back. It was one of Mr.
      Martin's sudden caprices to ask him to Cro' Martin. He fancied he ought to
      conciliate&mdash;I believe that's the phrase in vogue&mdash;the borough
      people, and this young man's father is the chief of them." And now Lady
      Dorothea turned from the topic as one unworthy of further thought, and
      entered upon the more congenial theme of her own high relatives and
      connections in England. It was strange enough that Massing-bred's remote
      alliance with her family was sufficient to induce an intimacy and
      familiarity with him which years of mere acquaintanceship could not have
      effected. That his grand-aunt had been a Conway, and his
      great-grandfather's half-brother was married to a Jernyngham, were all a
      species of freemasonry by which he was admitted at once to the privilege
      of confidential discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no small mortification to Massingbred to spend his evening in these
      genealogical researches; he had seen the two young girls move off into an
      adjoining room, from which at times the sound of a piano, and of voices
      singing, issued, and was half mad with impatience to be along with them.
      However, it was a penalty must be exacted, and he thought that the toll
      once paid he had secured himself against all demands for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not caring to participate in the many intricacies of those family
      discussions wherein the degrees of relationship of individuals seem to
      form the sole points of interest, we shall betake ourselves to the little
      blue drawing-room, where, seated at the piano together, the two young
      girls talked, while their fingers strayed along the notes as though
      affording a species of involuntary accompaniment to their words. Nelligan,
      it is true, was present; but, unnoticed by either, he sat apart in a
      distant corner, deep in his own brooding thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary had only made Miss Henderson's acquaintance on that evening, but
      already they were intimate. It was, indeed, no common boon for her to
      obtain companionship with one of her own age, and who, with the dreaded
      characteristics of a governess, was in reality a very charming and
      attractive person. Miss Henderson sang with all the cultivated knowledge
      of a musician; and, while she spoke of foreign countries where she had
      travelled, lapsed at times into little snatches of melody, as it were,
      illustrative of what she spoke. The delight Mary experienced in listening
      was unbounded; and if at moments a sad sense of her own neglected
      education shot through her mind, it was forgotten the next instant in her
      generous admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how are <i>you</i>, who have seen this bright and brilliant world you
      speak of," said Mary, "to sit quietly down in this unbroken solitude,
      where all the interests are of the humblest and more ordinary kind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget that I saw all these things, as it were, on sufferance,"
      replied she. "I was not born to them, nor could ever hope for more than a
      passing glance at splendors wherein I was not to share. And as for the
      quiet monotony here, an evening such as this, companionship like yours,
      are just as much above my expectations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, no!" cried Mary, eagerly. "You were as surely destined for a
      salon as I was for the rude adventures of my own wayward life. You don't
      know what a strange existence it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have heard, however!" said the other, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me&mdash;do tell me&mdash;what you have been told of me, and don't
      be afraid of wounding my vanity; for, I pledge you my word, I do think of
      myself with almost all the humility that I ought."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have heard you spoken of in the cabins of the poor as their only
      friend, their comforter, and their hope; the laborer knows you as his
      succor,&mdash;one by whose kind intervention he earns his daily bread;
      their children love you as their own chosen protector."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it's not of these things I 'm speaking," said Mary, rapidly. "Do they
      not call me self-willed, passionate, sometimes imperious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; and capricious at times!" said the other, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary colored, and her voice faltered as she said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "There they were unjust. The impracticable tempers I have to deal with&mdash;the
      untutored minds and undisciplined natures&mdash;often lead me into seeming
      contradictions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like the present, perhaps," said Miss Henderson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How! the present?" said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That, while claiming the merit of humility, you at once enter upon a
      self-defence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, perhaps I <i>am</i> capricious!" said Mary, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And haughty?" asked the other, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe so!" said Mary, with a degree of dignity that seemed to display
      the sentiment while confessing to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never heard a heavier accusation against Miss Martin than these,"
      said she, "and I have lived with those who rarely scruple how to criticise
      their betters."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was silent and thoughtful; she knew not how to interpret the mingled
      praise and censure she had just listened to.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But tell me rather of yourself," said Mary, as though willing to turn the
      topic of conversation. "I should like to hear your story."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At thirteen years of age&mdash;I believe even a year later&mdash;I was
      the playfellow of the young gentleman you see yonder," said Kate
      Henderson, "but who, to-night, seems incapable of remembering anything or
      anybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of Mr. Nelligan?" repeated Mary. And Joseph started as he heard his name,
      looked up, and again relapsed into revery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm not sure that we were not in love. I almost confess that I was, when
      my father sent me away to France to be educated. I was very sad&mdash;very,
      very sad&mdash;at being taken away from home and thrown amongst strangers,
      with none of whom I could even interchange a word; and I used to sit and
      cry for hours by myself, and write sorrowful love-letters to 'dearest
      Joseph,' and then imagine the answers to them; sometimes I actually wrote
      them, and would suffer agonies of anguish before I dared to break the seal
      and learn the contents. Meanwhile I was acquiring a knowledge of French,
      and knew a little of music, and used to sing in our choir at chapel, and
      learned to believe the world was somewhat larger than I had hitherto
      thought it, and that St. Gudule was finer than the mean little church at
      Oughterard; and worse still&mdash;for it <i>was</i> worse&mdash;that the
      sous-lieutenants and cadets of the Military College had a much more
      dashing, daring look about them than 'poor Joseph;' for so I now called
      him to myself, and gave up the correspondence soon after.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember, Miss Martin, that I was but a child at this time&mdash;at
      least, I was little more than fourteen&mdash;but in another year I was a
      woman, in all the consciousness of certain attractions, clever enough to
      know that I could read and detect the weak points in others, and weak
      enough to fancy that I could always take advantage of them. This incessant
      spirit of casuistry, this passion for investigating the temper of those
      about you, and making a study of their natures for purposes of your own,
      is the essence of a convent life; you have really little else to do, and
      your whole bent is to ascertain why Sister Agnes blushes, or why Beatrice
      fainted twice at the Angelus. The minute anatomy of emotions is a very
      dangerous topic. At this very moment I cannot free myself from the old
      habit; and as I see young Mr. Nelligan there sitting with his head in his
      hand, so deep in thought as not to notice us, I begin to examine why is it
      he is thus, and on what is he now brooding?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And can you guess?" asked Mary, half eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could be certain, if I were but to ask him a question or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray do then, if only to convince me of your skill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I must be alone, and that is scarcely possible,&mdash;scarcely
      becoming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us contrive some way,&mdash;think of something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is too late now; he is about to leave the room," said Kate,
      cautiously. "How pale he looks, and how anxious his eye has become! I
      thought at first there was some constraint at meeting <i>me</i> here; he
      feared, perhaps&mdash;but no, that would be unworthy of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      She ceased, for Nelligan had now drawn nigh to where they sat, and stood
      as if trying to collect himself to say something.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you sing, Mr. Nelligan?" asked Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I am ignorant of music," said he, half abstractedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you like it?" asked Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I believe I do,&mdash;that is, it calms and quiets me. If I could
      understand it, it would do more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why not understand it, since that is the way you phrase it?" asked
      Kate. "Everybody can be a musician to a certain degree of proficiency.
      There is no more ear required than you want to learn a language."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you shall teach me," cried Mary, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate took up her hand and pressed it to her lips for a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Foreigners&mdash;men, I mean&mdash;are all so well aware of this that
      they cultivate music as a necessary part of education; few attain high
      eminence, but all know something of it. But somehow we have got to believe
      that cultivation in England must always tend to material profit. We learn
      this, that, and t' other, to be richer or greater or higher, but never to
      be more acceptable in society, more agreeable or pleasanter company."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have n't time," said Nelligan, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For what have we not time? Do you mean we have no time to be happy?"
      cried Repton, suddenly stepping in amongst them. "Now, my dear young
      ladies, which of you will bid highest for the heart of an old lawyer&mdash;by
      a song?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be Miss Henderson," said Mary, smiling, "for I don't sing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a ballad?&mdash;not even one of the Melodies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not even one of the Melodies," said she, sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shame upon me for that 'even,'" said Repton; "but you see what comes of
      surviving one's generation. I lived in an age when the 'Last Rose of
      Summer' and the 'Harp that Once' were classical as Homer's 'Hymns,' but I
      have now fallen upon times when English music is estimated in the same
      category with English cookery, and both deemed very little above
      barbarous. To be sure," added he, "it does seem very like a poetical
      justice for the slavish adherence of <i>our</i> education to Greek and
      Roman literature, that our ladies should only sing to us in the languages
      of Italy or Germany."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you would not imply that we are as little versed in these as great
      scholars are in the others?" said Kate Henderson, slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sharply said, miss, and truthfully insinuated too! Not to mention that
      there is courage in such a speech before Mr. Nelligan, here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;very true&mdash;a just remark!" said Joseph, who only overheard
      a reference to himself without understanding to what it alluded. And now a
      very joyous burst of laughter from the others startled him, while it
      covered him with confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must make them sing, Nelligan," said Repton, gayly. "They'll vanquish
      us in these tilting-matches of word-fence.&mdash;Now, Miss Henderson,
      something very plaintive and very sentimental, to suit the tenderness of a
      feeling heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll sing for you with pleasure," said Kate. "Will this suit you?" And
      with a short prelude she sang one of those brilliant little snatches of
      Venetian melody which seem like the outburst of a sudden inspiration,&mdash;wild,
      joyous, floating as they are,&mdash;wherein such is the expression that
      sounds usurp the place of language, and the mind is carried away by a
      dreamy fascination impossible to resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How often have I heard that on the Lido!" said Mas-singbred, entering the
      room hastily; "and what a glorious thing it is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you know this?" said Kate, running her fingers over the notes, and
      warbling out another of the popular airs of the same class.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The last time I heard that," said Jack, musingly, "was one night when
      returning home from a late party, along the Grand Canal at Venice. There
      is a single word at the end of each verse which should be uttered by a
      second voice. Just as I passed beneath a brilliantly lighted salon, the
      sounds of this melody came floating forth, and as the stanza finished, I
      supplied the 'refrain.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You?" cried Kate, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but why do you ask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you remember the exact spot?" said she, not heeding his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As well as though I were there only yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I tell you where it was?" He waited, and she went on: "It was under
      the balcony of the Mocenigo Palace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, this is witchcraft," cried Jack; "you are perfectly correct."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The bouquet that was thrown to you from the window fell into the water."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I regained it. I have it still," cried he, more eagerly; "and yours
      was the hand that threw it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How strange, is it not, that we should meet here?" He paused for a minute
      or two, and then said, "It was the Duchesse de Courcelles lived there at
      the time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we passed the winter in that palace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Henderson was the companion of the young Princess," said Lady
      Dorothea, who had just joined the group, and experienced no slight shock
      at observing the tone of easy familiarity in which the conversation was
      conducted. But Massingbred seemed wonderfully little moved by the
      intelligence, for, drawing his chair closer to Kate's, he led her to talk
      of Venice and its life, till, imperceptibly as it were, the discourse
      glided into Italian. What a dangerous freemasonry is the use of a foreign
      language, lifting the speakers out of the ordinary topics, and leading
      them away to distant scenes and impressions, which, constituting a little
      world apart, give a degree of confidential feeling to intercourse.
      Massingbred would willingly have lent himself to the full enjoyment of
      this illusion; but Kate, with quicker tact, saw all the difficulties and
      embarrassment it would occasion, and under pretext of searching for some
      music, escaped at once from the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How I envy you, dear girl!" said Mary, following her, and passing her arm
      affectionately around her. "What a happiness must it be to possess such
      gifts as yours, which, even in their careless exercise, are so graceful.
      Tell me frankly, is it too late for me to try&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You overrate <i>me</i> as much as you disparage yourself," said Kate,
      mildly; "but if you really will accept me, I will teach you the little
      that I know, but, in return, will you make <i>me</i> your friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary pressed the other's hand warmly within her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here are some vows of everlasting friendship going forward, I 'll be
      sworn," said old Repton, stepping in between them; "and you ought to have
      a legal opinion as to the clauses,&mdash;eh, young ladies, am I not
      right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When was Mr. Repton wrong?" said Mary, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When he waited till his present age to fall in love!" said he, gayly.
      "But, seriously, what have you done with our young student? Of all the
      woe-begone faces I ever beheld, his was the very saddest, as he moved into
      the large drawing-room awhile ago. Which of you is to blame for this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not guilty, upon my honor," said Mary, with mock solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm half afraid that our showy friend has eclipsed him in <i>your</i>
      eyes, as I own to you he has in <i>mine</i>, clever fellow that he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you not charmed with yourself that you did not shoot him this
      morning?" said Mary, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sincerely gratified that he has not shot me, which, taking his
      pistol performance on the same level with his other acquirements, was not
      so very improbable!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's your uncle stealing away to bed," said Repton, "and fancying that
      nobody remarks him. Shall I be cruel enough to mar the project? Martin&mdash;Martin&mdash;come
      here for a moment; we want your opinion on a knotty point."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know what it is," said Martin, smiling; "the question under discussion
      is,'Whether you or Mr. Massingbred were the more successful to-day?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think Mr. Massingbred may claim the prize," said Mary Martin, with a
      sly whisper; "he made Lady Dorothea cry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," said Repton, "but <i>I</i> made young Nelligan laugh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the party broke up, Massingbred lingering a little behind to say
      something to Miss Henderson, and then betaking himself to his chamber,
      well satisfied with his day, and the change it had wrought in his
      fortunes. Perhaps a few passages from a letter that he, on that same
      night, penned to one of his friends in Dublin, will not be ill-timed as an
      exponent of his sentiments. The letter was written, directing certain
      articles of dress to be forwarded to him at once, by coach, and contained
      these paragraphs:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You now know how I came here: the next thing is to tell you of the place
      itself. The house is large and admirably <i>montée</i>&mdash;abundance of
      servants, well drilled, and orderly. The master a nonentity, apparently;
      easy-tempered and good-humored; liking the quiet monotony of his humdrum
      life, and only asking that it may not be interfered with. His wife, a fine
      lady of the school of five-and-forty years ago,&mdash;a nervous terrorist
      about mob encroachments and the democratic tendencies of the times,&mdash;insufferably
      tiresome on genealogies and 'connections,' and what many would call
      downright vulgar in the amount of her pretension. Gratitude&mdash;for I
      have the honor of being a favorite already&mdash;seals my lips against any
      further or harsher criticism. As for the niece, she is decidedly handsome;
      a great deal of style about her too; with a degree of&mdash;shall I call
      it daring? for it is more like courage than any other quality&mdash;that
      tells you she is the uncontrolled ruler over the wild regions and wild
      people around her. With more of manner, she would be very charming; but
      perhaps she is better in the unfettered freedom of her own capricious
      independence: it certainly suits her to perfection. And now I should have
      completed my catalogue, if it were not for the governess. Ay, Harry, the
      governess! And just fancy, under this unimposing title, a dark-eyed,
      haughty-looking girl&mdash;I don't think she can be above twenty or
      twenty-one&mdash;with a carriage and port that might suit an Archduchess
      of Austria. She has travelled all over Europe&mdash;been everywhere&mdash;seen
      everything, and, stranger again, everybody; for she was what they style a
      companion. By Jove! she must have been a very charming one; that is, if
      she liked it; for if she did not, Hal!&mdash;At all events, here she is;
      only having arrived the very day before myself; so that we are free to
      discuss the family, and compare notes together, in the most confidential
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I need n't tell <i>you</i> Jack Massingbred does not fall in
      love,&mdash;the very phrase implies it must be beneath one,&mdash;but I
      already see that if such a girl were a Lady Catherine or a Lady Agnes,
      with a father in the Upper House, and two brothers in the 'Lower,' her
      dowry anything you like above thirty thousand,&mdash;that, in short, even
      Jack himself might exhibit the weakness of inferior mortals; for she is
      precisely one of those types that are ever looking upward,&mdash;a girl
      with a high ambition, I 'll be sworn, and formed to make the man, whose
      fortunes she shared, stand forward in the van and distinguish himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These are our whole <i>dramatis persono</i>, if I include an old
      barrister, with a racy humor and a strong stock of Bar anecdotes; and
      young Nelligan, the Medal man, whom you quizzed me so much for noticing in
      Dublin. You were right then, Harry; he <i>is</i> a low fellow, and I was
      wrong in ever thinking him otherwise. I chanced upon his father's
      acquaintance rather oddly; and the son has not forgiven it. When we met
      here, yesterday, he fancied that we were to speak, and was actually
      rushing forward to shake hands with the most enthusiastic warmth; but with
      that manner which you have often admired, and once encouraged, when you
      called me the 'Cool of the day,' I pulled him up dead short, stared, and
      passed on. At dinner, I managed to ignore him so utterly that everybody
      else fell into the trap, and he dined as a tutor or the chaplain or the
      agent's son might,&mdash;mingling his sighs with the soup, and sipping his
      claret in all dreariness.

      "You will see, even from these hasty lines, that there is enough here to
      interest and amuse; food for observation, and opportunity for malice. What
      can a man want more? The 'joint and the pickles.' They have asked me to
      stay,&mdash;they have even entreated; and so I mean to pass a week&mdash;perhaps
      two&mdash;here. I conclude that will give me enough of it: however, you
      shall hear frequently of my <i>res gesto</i>, and learn all that befalls

      "... When you pass that way, pray see what letters there may be lying for
      me in my chambers. If any of my father's&mdash;he writes in a large
      splashy hand&mdash;and the seal, two maces, saltierwise&mdash;forward them
      here. I am, or I shall soon be, in want of money; and as I have overdrawn
      my allowance already, I shall be obliged to issue bonds, bearing a certain
      interest. Can you recommend me to a safe capitalist?&mdash;not Fordyce&mdash;nor
      Henniker&mdash;nor yet Sloan&mdash;with all of whom I have held dealings,
      mutually disagreeable. It is a sad reflection that the stamp worth five
      shillings upon a piece of unsullied paper is absolutely valueless when the
      words 'Jack Massingbred' are inscribed beneath. Try, and if you can, solve
      this curious problem.

      CHAPTER XVIII. STATECRAFT
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a cabinet council; they were met in Lady Dorothea's boudoir, Martin
      and Mr. Repton being summoned to her presence. A letter had that morning
      reached her Ladyship from a very high quarter; the writer was the Marquis
      of Reckington, a very distant connection, who had suddenly been graciously
      pleased, after a long interval of utter obliviousness, to remember that
      Lady Dorothea was his relative, and yet living! Whatever pride her
      Ladyship might have summoned to her aid to repel the slights or
      impertinences of the vulgar, she displayed a most Christian forgiveness as
      she broke the seal of an epistle from one who had left several of her own
      without answers, and even replied to her application for a staff
      appointment for her son, by a cold assurance that these were times when
      "nothing but fitness and superior qualifications entitled any man to
      advancement in the public service." Oh dear, were there ever any other
      times since the world was made! Is not merit the only passport to place,
      and high desert and capacity the sole recommendation to favor? Of all the
      immense advantages of a representative government, is there any more
      conspicuous than the unerring certainty with which men of ability rise to
      eminence without other aid than their own powers; and that, in a system
      like ours, family influence, wealth, name, connections, and parliamentary
      support are just so much mere dross? If any one be incredulous of the
      virtue of public men, let him only ask for a place; let him entreat his
      great friend&mdash;everybody has at least one great friend&mdash;mine is a
      coroner&mdash;to make him a Junior Lord, or a Vice-Something, and see what
      the answer will be. Polite, certainly; nothing more so; but what a rebuke
      to self-seeking!&mdash;what a stern chastisement to the ignorant
      presumption that places are awarded by means of favor, or that the public
      service is ever filled through the channels of private influence! Far from
      it. He is told that our age is an incorruptible one, that ministers pass
      sleepless nights in balancing the claims of treasury clerks, and that Lord
      Chancellors suffer agonies in weighing the merits of barristers of six
      years' standing. "We have but one rule for our guidance: the best man in
      the best place." A high-sounding maxim, which it would be excessively
      uncivil to disparage by asking what constitutes "a best man." Is he some
      unscrupulous partisan, who first gave his fortune, and afterwards his
      fame, to the support of a party? Is he the indisputable disposer of three,
      or perhaps four votes in the House? Is he a floating buoy to be anchored
      in either roadstead of politics, and only to be secured to either, for a
      consideration? Is he the dangerous confidant of some damaging transaction?
      Or is he the deserter from a camp, where his treason may sow disaffection?
      These several qualifications have ere this served to make up "a best man;"
      and strangely enough, are gifts which fit him for the Army, the Navy, the
      Home Service, or the Colonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us turn from this digression, into which we have fallen half
      inadvertently, and read over some parts of Lord Reckington's letter. It
      was somewhat difficult to decipher, as most great men's letters are, and
      displayed in more than one place the signs of correction. Although it had
      been, as we have said, a very long time since any correspondence had
      occurred between the "cousins," his Lordship resumed the intercourse as
      though not a week had intervened. After a little playful chiding over the
      laxity of her Ladyship's writing habits,&mdash;three of hers had been left
      unreplied to,&mdash;and some of that small gossip of family changes and
      events, never interesting to any but the direct actors, his Lordship
      approached the real topic of his letter; and, as he did so, his writing
      grew firmer, and larger and bolder, like the voice of a man who spoke of
      what truly concerned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought, my dear Dora, I had done with it all. I flattered myself that
      I had served my time in public capacities, and that neither the Crown nor
      its advisers could reasonably call upon me for further sacrifices. <i>You</i>
      know how little to my taste were either the cares or ambitions of office.
      In fact, as happens to most men who are zealous for the public service, my
      official career imposed far more of sacrifices than it conferred
      privileges. Witness the occasions in which I was driven to reject the
      claims of my nearest and dearest friends, in compliance with that nervous
      terror of imputed favoritism so fatal to all in power! I thought, as I
      have said, that they had no fair claim upon me any longer. I asked
      nothing; indeed, many thought I was wrong there. But so it was; I quitted
      office without a pension, and without a ribbon! It was late on a Saturday
      evening, however, when a Cabinet messenger arrived at 'Beech Woods' with
      an order for me to repair at once to Windsor. I was far from well; but
      there was no escape. Immediately on arriving I was summoned to the
      presence, and before I had paid my respects, his Majesty, who was much
      excited, said, 'Reckington, we want you. You must go to Ireland!' I
      believe I started, for he went on, 'I 'll have no refusal. There is but
      one settlement of this question that I will accept of. You shall go to
      Ireland!' The King then entered with considerable warmth, but with all his
      own remarkable perspicuity, into a detail of late changes and events in
      the Cabinet. He was excessively irritated with B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and
      spoke of G&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;as one whom he never could forgive. He
      repeatedly said, 'I have been duped; I have been tricked;' and, in fact,
      exhibited a degree of emotion which, combined with the unbounded frankness
      of his manner towards me, affected me almost to tears. Of course, my dear
      Dora, personal considerations ceased at once to have any hold upon me; and
      I assured his Majesty that the remainder of my life was freely at his
      disposal, more than requited, as it already was, by the precious
      confidence he had that day reposed in me. I must not weary you with
      details. I accepted and kissed hands as Viceroy on Monday morning; since
      that I have been in daily communication with G&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, who
      still remains in office. We have discussed Ireland from morning to night,
      and I hope and trust have at last come to a thorough understanding as to
      the principles which must guide the future administration. These I reserve
      to talk over with you when we meet; nor do I hesitate to say that I
      anticipate the very greatest benefit in the fruits of your long residence
      and great powers of observation of this strange people." The letter here
      went off into a somewhat long-winded profession of the equal-handed
      justice which was to mark the acts of the administration. It was to be, in
      fact, a golden era of equity and fairness; but, somehow, as codicils are
      occasionally found to revoke the body of the testament, a very suspicious
      little paragraph rather damaged this glorious conclusion. "I don't mean to
      say, my dear coz., that we are to neglect our followers,&mdash;the
      Government which could do so never yet possessed, never deserved to
      possess, able support; but we must discriminate,&mdash;we must distinguish
      between the mere partisan who trades on his principles, and that
      high-minded and honorable patriot who gives his convictions to party. With
      the noisy declaimer at public meetings, the mob-orator or pamphleteer, we
      shall have no sympathy. To the worthy country gentleman, independent by
      fortune as well as by principle, extending the example of a blameless life
      to a large neighborhood, aiding us by his counsels as much as by the
      tender of his political support,&mdash;to him, I say, we shall show our
      gratitude, not grudgingly nor sparingly, but freely, openly, and largely.
      You now know in what ranks we wish to see our friends, in the very van of
      which array I reckon upon yourself." We shall again skip a little, since
      here the writer diverged into a slight dissertation on the indissoluble
      ties of kindred, and the links, stronger than adamant, that bind those of
      one blood together. After a brief but rapid survey of the strong
      opposition which was to meet them, he went on: "Of course all will depend
      upon our parliamentary support; without a good working majority we cannot
      stand, and for this must we use all our exertions." A few generalities on
      the comfort and satisfaction resulting from "safe divisions" ensued, and
      then came the apparently careless question, "What can <i>you</i> do for
      us? Yes, my dear Dora, I repeat, what can <i>you</i> do for us? What we
      need is the support of men who have courage enough to merge old prejudices
      and old convictions in their full trust in us; who, with the intelligence
      of true statesmanship, will comprehend the altered condition of the
      country, and not endeavor to adapt the nation to <i>their</i> views, but
      rather <i>their</i> views to the nation. In a word, a wise and liberal
      policy, not based upon party watchwords and antiquated symbols, but on the
      prospect of seeing Ireland great and united. Now, will Martin come to our
      aid in this wise? He ought to be in Parliament for his county. But if he
      be too indolent, or too happy at home, whom can he send us? And again,
      what of the borough? They tell me that Kilcock, seeing his father's great
      age, will not stand where a contest might be expected, so that you must
      necessarily be prepared with another."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the writer launched out upon the happiness he felt at being able to
      appeal thus candidly and freely to his own "dearest kinswoman," inviting
      her to speak as frankly in return, and to believe that no possible
      difference of political opinion should ever throw a coldness between those
      whose veins were filled with the same blood, and whose hearts throbbed
      with the same affections. Her Ladyship's voice slightly faltered as she
      read out the concluding paragraph, and when she laid the letter down, she
      turned away her head and moved her handkerchief to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Martin, he sat still and motionless, his gaze firmly directed to
      Repton, as though seeking in the impassive lines of the old lawyer's face
      for some clew to guide and direct him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You used to be a Tory, Martin?" said Repton, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, to be sure, we were always with that party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there's an end of them now," said the other. "What's to follow and
      fill their place, my Lord Reckington may be able to say; I cannot. I only
      know that <i>they</i> exist no longer; and the great question for you&mdash;at
      least, one of the great questions&mdash;is, have you spirit enough to join
      a travelling party without knowing whither they 're journeying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what may be the other great question, sir?" asked Lady Dorothea,
      haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The other is, what will it cost in money&mdash;ay, my Lady, in money;
      because any other outlay will not require searches nor title-deeds, loans,
      mortgages, nor bond-debts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To contest the county would cost ten thousand pounds; Scanlan says so,"
      rejoined Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the borough?" asked Repton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A few hundreds would suffice; at least, they have done so hitherto."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then remain content with the cheap luxury of the borough," said Repton.
      "You don't want anything from these people, Martin. You don't covet a
      peerage; you would n't accept a baronetcy. You remember what Langton said
      when told that the King was going to give him the 'Red Hand.' 'If I have
      been unfortunate enough to incur his Majesty's displeasure, I must deplore
      it deeply; but surely my innocent son should not be included in the
      penalty of my offence. Therefore, in all humility, I beseech and entreat
      the royal favor to commute the sentence into knighthood, so that the
      disgrace may die with me.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There were times when such insolence would have cost him dearly," said
      her Ladyship, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not sorry that we don't live in them, my Lady," replied Repton. "But
      to return: as I was saying, you ask for no favors; why should you expend
      ten or fifteen thousand pounds to advocate views of whose tendencies you
      know nothing, and principles whose very meaning you are in ignorance of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I anticipated every word of this," said Lady Dorothea. "I told Mr.
      Martin, this morning, almost literally, the exact advice you'd proffer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am proud that your Ladyship should have read me so justly," said
      Repton, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      An insolent toss of her head was the significant answer to this speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But were I to speak my mind more candidly, I 'd even say, let the borough
      go after the county; and for this plain reason," said Repton, speaking
      with increased firmness and animation, "you neither seek for the ambition
      of political life, nor want to make a trade of its casualties."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it not possible, sir, that we might desire the natural influence that
      should arise out of our station in society and our rank in this county?"
      said Lady Dorothea, proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your Ladyship has it, and can never lose it. Having a vote or two to
      throw into a Ministerial division would never repay you for the anxieties
      and cares of contested elections. Ah, my Lady, what do <i>you</i> care for
      the small flatteries of London attentions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We should have these, sir, as our right," broke she in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure you would, and much happiness do I hope they would confer,"
      added he, in a tone only overheard by Martin; then continued aloud: "As to
      the patronage at your disposal, would you take a present of it? Whom do
      you want to make tide-waiters, gaugers, barony-constables, or even clerks
      of the peace? Of all men living, who is so free of hungry dependants or
      poor relations!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must say, sir, that you reduce the question of political support to a
      very intelligible one of material benefit," said her Ladyship, with a
      sneer; "but, just for argument sake, imagine that there should be such a
      thing as a little principle in the matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to that part of the case, my Lady," said Repton. "Martin is a
      Tory; now, what are the men coming into power? I wish you could tell me.
      Here, for instance, is one of their own journals,"&mdash;and he opened a
      newspaper and ran his eye over the columns,&mdash;"ay, here it is: 'With
      regard to Ireland, Lord Reckington's appointment as Viceroy is the best
      guarantee that the rights of Irishmen of every persuasion and every
      denomination will be respected.' So far so good;" and he read on in a low,
      humdrum voice for some minutes, till he came to the following: "'No
      privileged class will any longer be tolerated; no exceptional loyalty
      admitted as an excuse for insufferable oppression and tyranny; the wishes
      and benefits of the people&mdash;the real people of that country&mdash;will
      at length enter into the views of an administration; and Ireland as she
      is,&mdash;not the possible Ireland of factious enthusiasts,&mdash;be
      governed by men determined to redress her grievances and improve her
      capacities.' Now, Martin, you want no augur to interpret that oracle. They
      are going to rule you by the people; but the people must be represented.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, who represents them? Not the demagogue; he is merely their tool. The
      real representative is the priest; don't laugh, my dear friend, at such a
      shadowy possibility; the thing is nearer than you dream of. No
      administration ever yet tried to govern Ireland except by intimidation.
      The Beresfords were undertakers once, and they did their work very well,
      let me tell you; they advanced their friends and whipped their enemies;
      and what with peerages for one set, and pitched caps for the other, they
      ruled Ireland. Then there came the Orangemen, who rather blundered their
      work; there were too many heads amongst them, and the really clever
      fellows were overborne by brawling, talkative fools, who always had the
      masses with them because they <i>were</i> fools. Still they ruled Ireland.
      They preserved the country to the King's crown; and I say once more, that
      was no small matter. And now we have arrived at a new era; we have
      obtained Emancipation, and must look out for another stamp of
      administrators, and I see nothing for it but the priest. Of course you,
      and every man of your station, sneer at the notion of being dictated to by
      Father Luke, in the greasy leather small-clothes and dirty black boots,&mdash;only,
      himself, a cottier once removed, a plant of the wild growth of the fields,
      cultivated, however, in the hotbeds of Maynooth,&mdash;a forcing-house
      whose fruits you are yet to taste of! Sneer away, Martin; but my name is
      not Val Repton if those men do not rule Ireland yet! Ay, sir, and rule it
      in such a fashion as your haughty Beresfords and Tottenhams, and Tisdalls
      never dreamed of! They 'll treat with the Government on equal terms,&mdash;so
      much, for so much; and, what's more, it won't be higgling for a place
      here, or a peerage there; but they'll have the price paid down in hard
      legislative coin,&mdash;Acts of Parliament, sir; privileges for themselves
      and their order, benefits to 'the Church;' and, when nothing better or
      more tempting offers, insults and slights to their antagonists. You, and
      all like you, will be passed over as if you never existed; the minister
      will not need you; you'll be so many general officers on the retired list,
      and only remarked when you swell the crowd at a levee."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, sir, according to this special prediction of yours, we have nothing
      left us but to live on our estates, enjoy what we can of our fortunes, and
      leave the interests of the nation to those our inferiors in rank, station,
      and property?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a period as your Ladyship has pictured forth&mdash;a little
      strongly, perhaps&mdash;is before you. Whether the interval be destined to
      be long or short, will, in great measure, depend upon yourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That agrees with what Scanlan said the other day," said Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scanlan!" echoed her Ladyship, with most profound contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is this Scanlan?" asked Repton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There he comes to answer for himself," said Martin. "The fellow drives
      neatly. See how cleverly he swept round that sharp turn! He may be 'at
      fault' about the world of politics; but, <i>my</i> word for it! he is a
      rare judge of a hack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, now that you suggest it," said Repton, musingly, "what an
      instinctive shrewdness there is on every subject,&mdash;I don't care what
      it is,&mdash;about fellows that deal in horse flesh. The practice of
      buying and selling, searching out flaws here, detecting defects there,
      gives a degree of suspectful sharpness in all transactions; besides that,
      really none but a naturally clever fellow ever graduates in the stable.
      You smile, my Lady; but some of our very first men have achieved the
      triumphs of the turf."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we have Scanlan in and hear the news?" asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not here. If you please, you may receive him in the library or your own
      room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, come along, Repton. We can resume this affair in the afternoon or
      to-morrow." And, without waiting for a reply, he passed his arm within the
      other's, and led him away. "You have been too abrupt with her, Repton; you
      have not made due allowances for her attachment to family influences,"
      said he, in a whisper, as they went along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repton smiled half contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's all very easy for you to laugh, my dear fellow; but, trust me,
      there's nothing to be done with my Lady in that fashion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Turn the flank,&mdash;eh?" said the old lawyer, slyly. "Ah, Martin, don't
      teach <i>me</i> how to deal with humanity. If you have not the courage to
      tell your wife that your estate cannot bear fresh encumbrances, new loans,
      and new debts&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!" said Martin, cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, I say, let me prevent the casualty, that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are you, Scanlan?" said Martin, as the attorney came, bowing and
      smiling, forward to pay his respects. "My friend, Mr. Repton, wishes to
      make your acquaintance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have the honor of being known to Mr. Repton, already, sir, if he has
      not forgotten me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh,&mdash;how? where?" cried the lawyer, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Reeves <i>versus</i> Dockery, and another, sir, in Hilary, 24. It was
      <i>I</i> supplied the instructions&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure,&mdash;perfectly right. Maurice Scanlan; isn't that the name?
      You did the thing well, sir; and if we failed, we retreated without
      dishonor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was a grand shot you fired at the Bench, sir, when all was over,"
      said Scanlan. "I don't suppose they ever got such a complete 'set down'
      before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I forget it," said Repton, but with a bright twinkle of his eye, which
      more than contradicted his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, sir, it's more than their Lordships ever will," said Scanlan. "The
      Chief Baron it was," said he, addressing Martin, "that overruled every
      objection made by Counsellor Repton, and at last declared that he would
      n't hear any more citations whatsoever. 'But I have a stronger case still,
      my Lord,' says the Counsellor. 'I 'll not hear it, sir,' said the Court.
      'It is in Crewe and Fust, Term Reports, page 1,438.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I don't care where it is, sir,' was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'In a charge delivered by Lord Eldon&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Oh, let us hear my Lord Eldon,' said Plumridge, the Puisne Judge, who
      was rather ashamed of the Chief Baron's severity. 'Let us hear my Lord
      Eldon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Here it is, my Lords,' said the Counsellor, opening the volume, and
      laying his hand upon the page,&mdash;'Crewe and Fust's Pleas of the Crown,
      page 1,438. My Lord Eldon says, "I may here observe the Courts of Law in
      Ireland are <i>generally</i> wrong! The Court of Exchequer is <i>always</i>
      wrong!"'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Repton tried to smother his own delighted laugh at the reminiscence, but
      all in vain; it burst from him long and joyously; and as he shook
      Scanlan's hand, he said, "The incident loses nothing by your telling, sir;
      you have done it admirable justice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You make me very proud, indeed, Counsellor," said Scanlan, who really did
      look overjoyed at the speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you any news for us, Scanlan?" said Martin, as they entered the
      library.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; the Ministry is out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We know that already, man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the Marquis of Reckington comes here as Lord-Lieutenant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That we know also."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Colonel Massingbred to be Chief Sec&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Moore Massingbred!" cried both, in a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; he that was a Treasury Lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you quite sure of this, Scanlan?" asked Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had it from Groves, sir, at the Castle, yesterday morning, who told me
      there would be an immediate dissolution, and showed me a list of
      Government candidates."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may talk them all over together, then," said Martin, "for I 'm
      heartily tired of politics this morning." And so saying, he left them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. A STUDIO
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is one of the most inestimable privileges of Art, that amidst all the
      cares and contentions of the world, amidst strife and war and carnage, its
      glorious realm is undisturbed, its peace unbroken, and its followers free
      to follow their own wayward fancies, without let or hindrance. Your great
      practical intelligences, your men of committees and corn and railroads and
      ship-canals, sneer at the fictitious life&mdash;for so does it seem to
      them&mdash;of the mere painter or musician. They have a sort of pitying
      estimate for capacities only exercised upon the ideal, and look down with
      a very palpable contempt upon those whose world is a gallery or an
      orchestra. After all, this division of labor is a wise and happy
      provision, carrying with it many and varied benefits, and making of that
      strange edifice of mankind a far more pleasing and harmonious structure
      than we should otherwise have seen it. The imagination is to the actual,
      in the world of active life, what flowers are to nutritious herbs and
      roots. It is the influence that adorns, elevates, and embellishes
      existence. That such gifts have been confided to certain individuals is in
      itself a sufficient evidence, just as we see in the existence of flowers
      that pleasure has its place assigned in the grand scheme of creation, and
      that the happiness which flows from gratified sense has not been denied
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that petty world which lived beneath the roof of Cro' Martin Castle,
      all the eager passions and excitements of political intrigue were now at
      work. My lady was full of plans for future greatness; Repton was scheming
      and suggesting, and thwarting everybody in turn; and even Martin himself,
      engulfed in the "Maelstrom" of the crisis, was roused into a state of
      semi-preparation that amounted to a condition of almost fever. As for
      Massingbred, whatever he really did feel, his manner affected a most
      consummate indifference to all that went forward; nor did the mention of
      his father's appointment to high office elicit from him anything beyond a
      somewhat contemptuous opinion of the new party in power. While, therefore,
      secret counsels were held, letters read and written, conferences conducted
      in every room, one little space was devoid of all these embarrassments and
      anxieties, and that was an oval chamber, lighted from the top, and
      originally destined for a summer ball-room, but now appropriated to Mr.
      Crow's use for the completion of the Grand Historical, which had lately
      been transferred from Kilkieran to its place there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unlucky masterpiece was doomed to many a difficulty. The great events
      in prospect had totally banished all thought of "art" from Lady Dorothea's
      mind. The fall of a recent administration was a far more imminent
      circumstance than the abdication of a king a few centuries back. Martin,
      of course, had enough on his head, without the cares of mock royalty. Mary
      was overwhelmed with occupations. The floods and a threatened famine were
      casualties not to be overlooked; and she was absent every day from dawn to
      late night; while, to complete the list of defaulters, young Nelligan&mdash;the
      future Prince of Orange of the picture&mdash;was gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      Men deplore their past youth, their bygone buoyancy of heart, their old
      loves and extinct friendships; but of all departed pleasures, there is a
      peculiar poignancy about one, and that is an artist's grief over a "lost
      sitter." You ladies and gentlemen whose thumbs have never closed on a
      palette, nor whose fingers have never felt the soft influence of varnish,
      may smile at such a sorrow, but take my word for it, it is a real and
      tangible affliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waving locks, the noble brow; the deep square orbits, and the finely
      cut chin are but the subtle suggestions out of which inspirations are
      begotten, and poetic visions nurtured. The graceful bearing and the noble
      port, the tender melancholy or the buoyant gladness, have each in turn
      struck some chord of secret feeling in the artist's breast, revealing to
      him new ideas of beauty, and imparting that creative power which displays
      itself in new combinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Simmy Crow was not a Titian nor a Vandyke, but unhappily the sorrows
      of genius are very often experienced by those who are not gifted with its
      greatness; and the humble aspirant of excellence can catch every malady to
      which the triumphant in all the wild enthusiasm of his powers is exposed.
      He sat down before his canvas, as some general might before a fortified
      town which had resisted all his efforts of attack. He was depressed and
      discouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upper part of the young student's head was already half finished, and
      there was enough done to impart a kind of promise of success,&mdash;that
      glorious vista which opens itself so often in imagination to those whose
      world is but their own fancy. He half thought he could finish it from
      memory; but before he had proceeded many minutes, he laid down the brush
      in despair. It seemed like a fatality that something must always interpose
      to bar the road to success. One time it was sickness, then it was poverty;
      a disparaging criticism had even done it; and now, when none of these
      threatened, there arose a new impediment. "Ah! Simmy, Simmy," he exclaimed
      aloud, "you were born under an unkindly planet. That's the secret of it
      all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I confess I cannot concur in that opinion," said a low, soft voice behind
      him. He started up, and beheld Kate Henderson, who, leaning on the back of
      a chair, continued to gaze steadfastly at the canvas, perfectly regardless
      of his astonishment. "There is a great deal to admire in that picture!"
      said she, as though talking to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simmy crept stealthily back, and stationed himself behind her, as if to
      hear her remarks, while viewing the picture from the same point.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have grouped your figures admirably," continued she, now addressing
      him, "and your management of the light shows a study of Rembrandt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true, ma'am&mdash;miss, I mean. I have copied nearly all his great
      pieces."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the drapery&mdash;that robe of the King's&mdash;tells me that you
      have studied another great master of color&mdash;am I right, sir, in
      saying Paul Veronese?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Simmy Crow's face glowed till it became crimson, while his eyes sparkled
      with intense delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear me!" he exclaimed, "is n't it too much happiness to hear this?
      and only a minute ago I was in black despair!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine is very humble criticism, sir; but as I have seen good pictures&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where? In the galleries abroad?" broke in Crow, hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All over Germany and Italy. I travelled with those who really cared for
      and understood art. But to come back to yours&mdash;that head is a noble
      study."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that's exactly what I'm grieving over,&mdash;he's gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young Mr. Nelligan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Himself. He started this morning for Oughterard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But probably to return in a day or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      Crow looked stealthily around to see if he were not likely to be
      overheard, and then, approaching Kate, said in a whisper,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think he 'll ever cross the doors again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so? has he received any offence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't make out what it is," said Simmy, with a puzzled look, "but he
      came to my room late last night, and sat down without saying a word; and
      at last, when I questioned him if he were ill, he said suddenly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Have you found, Mr. Crow, that in your career as an artist, you have
      been able to withdraw yourself sufficiently from the ordinary events of
      life as to make up a little world of your own, wherein you lived
      indifferent to passing incidents?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yes,' said I, 'I have, whenever I was doing anything really worth the
      name.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'And at such times,' said he, again, 'you cared nothing, or next to
      nothing, for either the flatteries or the sarcasms of those around you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I could n't mind them,' said I, 'for I never so much as heard them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Exactly what I mean,' said he, rapidly. 'Intent upon higher ambitions,
      you were above the petty slights of malice or envy, and with your own goal
      before you, were steeled against the minor casualties of the journey. Then
      why should not I also enjoy the immunity? Can I not summon to my aid a
      pride like this, or am I to be discouraged and disgraced to my own heart
      by a mere impertinence?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I stared at him, not guessing what he could mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Rather quit the spot with which it is associated,&mdash;quit it
      forever,' muttered he to himself, as he paced the room, while his face
      grew deathly pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'As for me,' said I, for I wanted to say something&mdash;anything, in
      short&mdash;just to take his attention a little off of himself, 'whenever
      the world goes hard with me, I just step into my studio, lock the door,
      and sit down before a fresh canvas. I throw in a bit of brown, with a dash
      of bluish gray over it,&mdash;half sky, half atmosphere,&mdash;and I daub
      away till something like an effect&mdash;maybe a sunset, maybe a
      sullen-looking seashore, maybe a long, low prairie swell&mdash;rises
      before me. I don't try for details, I don't even trace an outline, but
      just throw in an effect here and there, and by good luck it often comes
      right, in some fine harmony of color, that's sure to warm up my heart and
      cheer my spirits; for, as there are sounds that, swelling up, fill the
      whole nature of man with ecstasy, there are combinations of color and tint
      that enter the brain by the eye, and just produce the same sense of
      delight.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how did he accept your consolation?" asked she, smiling
      good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't well know if he listened to me," said Simmy, sorrowfully; "for
      all he said afterwards was,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, Mr. Crow, good-bye. I hope you 'll come to see me when you visit
      Dublin. You 'll easily find out my chambers in the college.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I said, 'I'd be delighted;' and there we parted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor fellow!" said Kate, but in an accent so peculiar it would have been
      very difficult to pronounce whether the words were of kindness or of
      disparagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your Prince, Mr. Crow?" said she, changing her tone to one of real or
      affected interest; "what's to be done now that Mr. Nelligan has left us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm thinking of making a background figure of him, miss," said Simmy.
      "Burnt sienna reduces many an illustrious individual to an obscure
      position."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why not ask Mr. Massingbred to take his place&mdash;you've seen him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only passing the window, miss. He is a handsome young man, but that same
      look of fashion, the dash of style about him, is exactly what destroys the
      face for <i>me</i>, I feel I could make nothing of it; I 'd be always
      thinking of him standing inside the plate-glass window of a London club,
      or cantering along the alleys of the Park, or sipping his iced lemonade at
      Tortoni's. There's no poetizing your man of gold chains and embroidered
      waistcoats!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I half suspect you are unjust in this case," said she, with one of her
      dubious smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm only saying what the effect is upon myself, miss," said Crow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why not make a compromise between the two?" said she. "I believe the
      great painters&mdash;Vandyke, certainly&mdash;rarely took the studies from
      a single head. They caught a brow here, and a mouth there, harmonizing the
      details by the suggestions of their own genius. Now, what if, preserving
      all this here,"&mdash;and she pointed to the head and eyes,&mdash;"you
      were to fill up the remainder, partly from imagination, partly from a
      study." And as she spoke she took the brush from his hand, and by a few
      light and careless touches imparted a new character to the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, go on! that's admirable,&mdash;that's glorious!" exclaimed Crow, wild
      with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0010" id="linkimage-0010">
      <!-- IMG --></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/276.jpg" width="100%" alt="276 " />
    </div>
    <p>
      "There is no necessity to lose the expression of haughty sorrow in the eye
      and brow," continued she; "nor does it interfere with the passing emotion
      he may be supposed unable to control, of proud contempt for that priestly
      influence which has dominated over the ambition of a king." And now, as
      though carried away by the theme, she continued to paint as rapidly as she
      spoke, while Crow busied himself in preparing the colors upon the palette.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My hardihood is only intended to encourage you, Mr. Crow," said she, "by
      showing that if one like me can point the road, the journey need not be
      deemed a difficult one." As she retired some paces to contemplate the
      picture, she casually glanced through a low glass door which opened upon
      the lawn, and where, under the shelter of a leafy beech, a young country
      girl was standing; her blue cloth cloak, with the hood thrown over her
      head, gave a certain picturesque character to the figure, which nearer
      inspection more than confirmed, for her features were singularly fine, and
      her large, soft blue eyes beamed with a gentle earnestness that showed
      Kate she was there with a purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opening the door at once, Kate Henderson approached her, and asked what
      she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an air of half pride, half shame, the country girl drew herself up,
      and stared full and steadfastly at the speaker, and so continued till Kate
      repeated her question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure you're not Miss Mary?" replied she, by questioning her in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but if I can be of any use to you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think you can," broke she in, with a manner almost haughty; "it's
      somebody else I 'm wanting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you wish to see Miss Martin, I 'll go and fetch her," said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did n't say it was her I wanted to see," replied she, with a calm and
      almost severe composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe her Ladyship?" asked Kate, far more interested than repelled by the
      other's manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's none of them at all," rejoined she. "I came here to speak to one
      that I know myself," added she, after a long pause; "and if he isn't gone,
      I want to see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I think I can guess now," said Kate, smiling. "It is the Counsellor
      from Dublin, Mr. Repton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is no such thing," said the girl, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it must be Mr. Crow, here."
    </p>
    <p>
      An indignant toss of the head gave the negative to this surmise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have gone through all our names here," said Kate; "and except Mr.
      Massingbred&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there's the very one I want," said the girl, boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Step in here and rest yourself, and I 'll send for him," said Kate; and
      with such persuasive courtesy were the words uttered, that almost, as it
      seemed, against her very will the girl followed her into the studio and
      sat down. While Mr. Crow proceeded in search of Massingbred, Kate
      Henderson, resuming brush and palette, returned to her painting; not,
      however, on the grand canvas of the "Historical," but dexterously
      interposing a piece of fresh board, she seized the opportunity to sketch
      the beautiful head then before her, while occupying the girl's attention
      with the objects around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding her intense astonishment at all she saw, the country girl
      never uttered a word, nor vouchsafed a single question as to the
      paintings; she even tried to moderate the eager pleasure they afforded by
      an endeavor not to admire them. Touched by the native pride of this
      struggle,&mdash;for struggle it was,&mdash;the features had assumed a look
      of haughty composure that well became the character of her beauty, and
      Kate caught up the expression so rapidly that her sketch was already
      well-nigh completed when Massing-bred entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Mistress Joan," cried he, shaking her cordially by both hands,
      "how glad I am to see you again! It was but this very moment I was
      inquiring how I could go over and pay you a visit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurriedly as these words were uttered, and in all the apparent fervor of
      hearty sincerity, they were accompanied by a short glance at Kate
      Henderson, who was about to leave the room, that plainly said, "Remain
      where you are, there is no mystery here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank yer honer kindly," said Joan Landy, "but it's no good coming, he
      is n't there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not there!&mdash;how and why is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure <i>you</i> ought to know better than me," said she, fixing her large
      eyes full upon him. "Ye left the house together, and <i>he</i> never came
      back since."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, perhaps I can guess," said Jack, pausing for a moment to reflect. "He
      might have deemed it safer to keep out of the way for a day or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no good deceivin' me, sir," said she, rising from her seat; "tell me
      the whole truth. Where is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is really more than I can say, my dear Mistress Joan. We parted in
      Oughterard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you never saw him after?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, I assure you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you never tried to see him?&mdash;you never asked what became of
      him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I concluded, indeed I was certain, that he returned home," said Jack, but
      not without some confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, that was enough for you," said she, angrily. "If you were a poor
      labor in' man, you 'd not desert him that had you under his roof and gave
      you the best he had; but because ye 're a gentleman&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is precisely for that reason I can't suffer you to think so meanly of
      me," cried Jack. "Now just hear me for one moment, and you'll see how
      unjust you've been." And, drawing his chair closer to hers, he narrated in
      a low and whispering voice the few events of their morning at Oughterard,
      and read for her the short note Magennis had written to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is that all?" exclaimed Joan, when he concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All, upon my honor!" said he, solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, then, wirra! wirra!" said she, wringing her hands sorrowfully, "why
      did I come here?&mdash;why did n't I bear it all patient? But sure my
      heart was bursting, and I could not rest nor sleep, thinking of what
      happened to him! Oh, yer honer knows well what he is to <i>me!</i>" And
      she covered her face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have done nothing wrong in coming here," said Jack, consolingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not if he never hears of it," said she, in a voice tremulous with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That he need never do," rejoined Jack; "though I cannot see why he should
      object to it. But come, Mrs. Joan, don't let this fret you; here's a young
      lady will tell you, as I have, that nobody could possibly blame your
      natural anxiety."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would a young lady know about a poor creature like <i>me?</i>"
      exclaimed Joan, dejectedly. "Sure, from the day she's born, she never felt
      what it was to be all alone and friendless!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You little guess to whom you say that," said Kate, turning round and
      gazing on her calmly; "but if the balance were struck this minute, take my
      word for it, you 'd have the better share of fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Massingbred's cheek quivered slightly as he heard these words, and
      his eyes were bent upon the speaker with an intense meaning. Kate,
      however, turned haughtily away from the gaze, and coldly reminded him that
      Mrs. Joan should have some refreshment after her long walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, miss,&mdash;no, yer honer; many thanks for the same," said Joan,
      drawing her cloak around her. "I couldn't eat a bit; my heart's heavy
      inside me. I 'll go back now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate tried to persuade her to take something, or, at least, to rest a
      little longer; but she was resolute, and eager to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we bear you company part of the way, then?" said Jack, with a look
      of half entreaty towards Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be but too happy," said Kate, while she turned the nearly
      completed sketch to the wall, but not so rapidly as to prevent
      Massingbred's catching a glimpse of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How like!" exclaimed he, but only in a whisper audible to himself. "I
      didn't know that this also was one of your accomplishments."
    </p>
    <p>
      A little laugh and a saucy motion of her head was all her reply, while she
      went in search of her bonnet and shawl. She was back again in a moment,
      and the three now issued forth into the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all Jack Massingbred's boasted "tact," and his assumed power of
      suiting himself to his company, he felt very ill at ease as he walked
      along that morning. "His world" was not that of the poor country girl at
      his side, and he essayed in vain to find some topic to interest her. Not
      so Kate Henderson. With all a woman's nice perception, and quite without
      effort, she talked to Joan about the country and the people, of whose
      habits she knew sufficient not to betray ignorance; and although Joan felt
      at times a half-suspicious distrust of her, she grew at length to be
      pleased with the tone of easy familiarity used towards her, and the
      absence of anything bordering on superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joan, whose instincts and sympathies were all with the humble class from
      which she sprung, described in touching language the suffering condition
      of the people, the terrible struggle against destitution maintained for
      years, and daily becoming more difficult and hopeless. It was like a
      shipwrecked crew reduced to quarter-rations, and now about to relinquish
      even these!
    </p>
    <p>
      "And they are patient under all this?" asked Kate, with that peculiar
      accent so difficult to pronounce its meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are, indeed, miss," was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have they any hope? What do they promise themselves as the remedy for
      these calamities?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorrow one of 'em knows," said she, with a sigh. "Some goes away to
      America, some sinks slowly under it, and waits for God's time to leave the
      world; and a few&mdash;but very few&mdash;gets roused to anger, and does
      something to be transported or put in jail."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Miss Martin,&mdash;does she not relieve a good deal of this misery?
      Is she not of immense benefit by her exertions here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arrah, what can a young lady do, after all? Sure it's always them that
      talks most and best gets over her. Some are ashamed, and some are too
      proud to tell what they 're suffering; and I believe in my heart, for one
      that 's relieved there are twenty more angry at seeing how lucky he was."
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked along now for some time in silence, when Joan, stopping short,
      said, "There's the house, miss; that's the place I live in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That house far away on the mountain side?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, miss; it's four miles yet from this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely you haven't to walk all that way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What signifies it? Is n't my heart lighter than when I came along this
      morning? And now I won't let you come any farther, for I'll take a short
      cut here across the fields."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I go and see you one of these days?" asked Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joan grew crimson to the very roots of her hair, and turned a look on
      Massingbred, as though to say, "You ought to answer this for me." But Jack
      was too deep in his own thoughts even to notice the appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can scarcely ask <i>you</i> to come to <i>me</i>," said Kate, quickly
      perceiving a difficulty, "for I 'm not even a visitor at Cro' Martin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm sure I hope it 's not the last time we 'll meet, miss; but maybe,"&mdash;she
      faltered, and a heavy tear burst forth, and rolled slowly along her cheek,&mdash;"maybe
      you oughtn't to come and see me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate pressed her hand affectionately, without speaking, and they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Joan gone?" asked Massingbred, raising his head from an attitude of
      deep revery. "When did she leave us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There she goes yonder," said Kate, pointing. "I fear me her spirits are
      not as light as her footsteps. Are her people very poor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her father was a herd, I believe," said he, carelessly; "but she does n't
      live at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she married, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm not sure that she is; but at least she believes that she is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor thing!" said Kate, calmly, while, folding her arms, she continued to
      gaze after the departing figure of the country girl. "Poor thing!"
      repeated she once more, and turned to walk homewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massingbred fixed his eyes upon her keenly as she uttered the words; few
      and simple as they were, they seemed to reveal to him something of the
      nature of her who spoke them. A mere exclamation&mdash;a syllable&mdash;will
      sometimes convey "whole worlds of secret thought and feeling," and it was
      evidently thus that Massingbred interpreted this brief expression. "There
      was nothing of scorn in that pity," thought he. "I wish she had uttered
      even one word more! She is a strange creature!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was thus speaking to himself that he walked along at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This wild and desolate scene is not very like that of which we talked the
      other night,&mdash;when first we met,&mdash;Miss Henderson."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget that we never met," said she, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, and yet there was a link between us even in those few flowers
      thrown at random."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be romantic, Mr. Massingbred; do not, I pray you," said she,
      smiling faintly. "You <i>know</i> it's not your style, while it would be
      utterly thrown away upon <i>me</i>, I am aware that fine gentlemen of your
      stamp deem this the fitting tone to assume towards 'the governess;' but I
      'm really unworthy of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a strange girl you are!" said he, half thinking aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, how very commonplace!" said she, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you like this country?" asked Massingbred, with an imitation of her
      own abrupt manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said she, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor the people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor the people!" was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is your life to be passed amongst them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," said she, with a slight gesture of her shoulders. "Don't you
      know, Mr. Massingbred," added she, with more energy, "that a woman has no
      more power to shape her destiny than a leaf has to choose where it will
      fall? If I were a man,&mdash;you, for instance,&mdash;I would think and
      act differently."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to hear what you would do if in my place," said Jack, with
      a degree of deep interest in the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To begin, I'll tell you what I would not do," said she, firmly. "I 'd not
      waste very good abilities on very small objects; I 'd neither have small
      ambitions nor small animosities. You have both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As how?" asked he, frankly, and with no touch of irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I to be candid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even to rudeness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cut as deeply as you like," said he, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then here goes: For the 'small ambition' I speak of, it was displayed
      yesterday at dinner, when, in rivalry with that old lawyer, you
      condescended to play agreeable, to out-talk him, out-quote, and
      out-anecdote him. It is true you succeeded; but what a poor success it
      was! how inadequate to the forces that were mustered to effect it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now for the other count of the indictment," said he, with a half
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "First, do you plead guilty to this one?" asked she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; with an 'extenuating circumstance.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that <i>you</i> were present," said Jack, with a glance of more than
      mere passing gallantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said she, after a pause, "I <i>did</i> take some of the display to
      my own share. I saw that you did n't care to captivate the young lady of
      the house, and that my Lady bored you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Insufferably!" exclaimed Jack, with energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your manner showed it," said she, "even more than such polish ought to
      have betrayed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I 'm sure I never exhibited any signs of my martyrdom," said he; "I
      stood my torture well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not half so heroically as you fancied I noticed your weariness before the
      dinner was half over, as I detected your splenetic dislike to young Mr.
      Nelligan&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To young Nelligan?&mdash;then he has told you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop,&mdash;be cautious," broke she in, hurriedly; "don't turn evidence
      against yourself. <i>He</i> has told me nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing; I only surmise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what is your surmise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That he and you had met before,&mdash;that you had even been intimate,&mdash;and
      now, from some misunderstanding, you had ceased to be friends. Mind, I
      don't want confessions; I don't seek to learn your secrets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you shall hear this from me," said Massingbred, with earnestness;
      "and perhaps you, so ready to blame me for some things, may see reason to
      think well of me in this." He then related, briefly, but simply, the
      history of his acquaintance with Nelligan; he dwelt, not without feeling,
      upon the passages of their student-life, and at last spoke of his chance
      visit to Oughterard, and the accident by which he became old Nelligan's
      guest. "What can you make of Joseph's conduct," cried he; "or how explain
      his refusal to meet me at his father's table? One of two reasons there
      must be. He either discredits me in the character of his friend, or
      shrinks, with an ignoble shame, from appearing there in his real position,&mdash;the
      son of the country shopkeeper! I scarcely know if I 'd not prefer he
      should have been actuated by the former motive; though more offensive to
      me, in <i>him</i> it were more manly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not have asked him which alternative he accepted?" asked Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because the opportunity to wound him deeply&mdash;incurably&mdash;first
      presented itself. I knew well that nothing would hurt him like the cool
      assumption of not recognizing him, and I determined not to lose my
      vengeance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a woman," said Kate, "and I'd not have stooped to <i>that!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rarely that Massingbred's emotions gave any evidence of their
      working; but now his cheek grew crimson, as he said, "A man can only
      measure a man's indignation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are angry without cause," said she, calmly; "you wish me to pronounce
      a verdict on an act, and are displeased because I think differently from
      you. How right I was in my guess that small animosities were amongst your
      failings! You seek now to quarrel with <i>me!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Massingbred walked along for some moments without speaking, and then said,
      "You knew Nelligan formerly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we were playfellows together as children; lovers, I believe, a
      little later on&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now?" broke he in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now very good friends, as the world uses that phrase. At all events,"
      added she, after a brief pause, "enough his friend to be able to say that
      you have wronged him by your suspicions. Joe Nelligan&mdash;or I'm much
      mistaken&mdash;may feel the inequality of his position as a something to
      overcome, a barrier to be surmounted; not as a disability to contest the
      prizes of life even with such as Mr. Massingbred."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is <i>you</i> now would quarrel with <i>me</i>," said Jack, retorting
      her own words upon her. "And yet," he added, in a lower tone, "I would
      wish to have you my friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you can, upon one condition," replied she, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I accept, whatever it be. Name it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you be your own friend; that you address yourself to the business of
      life seriously and steadily, resolving to employ your abilities as a means
      of advancement, not as a mere instrument for amusement; determine, in
      fact, to be something besides a <i>dilettante</i> and an idler."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it a bargain, then, if I do this?" asked he, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I promise you the high and mighty boon of <i>my</i> friendship,"
      replied she, with mock solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so we seal our contract," said he, pressing her hand to his lips, but
      with an air of such respectful gallantry that the action implied nothing
      bordering on a liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now I leave you," said she, as she opened the wicket-gate of a small
      flower-garden; "such conferences as ours must not be repeated, or they
      might be remarked upon. Good-bye." And without waiting for his reply, she
      passed on into the garden, while Massingbred stood gazing after her
      silently and thoughtfully.

      CHAPTER XX. AN ELECTION ADDRESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Am I behind time, Mr. Massingbred?" said Kate Henderson, as she entered
      the library, about a week after the events we have last recorded,&mdash;"am
      I behind time?" said she, approaching a table where the young man sat
      surrounded with a mass of letters and papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not very much," said he, rising, and placing a chair for her; "and I take
      it for granted you came as soon as you could."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I have finished my morning's reading for her Ladyship, noted her
      letters, answered the official portion of her correspondence, talked the
      newspaper for Mr. Martin, hummed a singing lesson for Miss Mary, listened
      to a grand jury story of Mr. Repton; and now, that they are all off to
      their several destinations, here I am, very much at the service of Mr.
      Massingbred."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who never needed counsel more than at this moment!" said Jack, running
      his hands distractedly through his hair. "That 's from my father!" added
      he, handing her a letter with a portentous-looking seal attached to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a fine bold hand, and how easy to read!" said she, perusing it. Jack
      watched her narrowly while she read; but on her calm impassive face not a
      line nor a lineament betrayed emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, then, an English borough he recommends," said she, laying it down;
      "and I suppose, looking to an official career, he is quite right. The 'No
      Irish need apply' might be inscribed over Downing Street; but is that
      altogether your view?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I scarcely know what I project as yet," said he. "I have no career!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let us plan one," replied she, crossing her arms on the table, and
      speaking with increased earnestness. "The Martins have offered you
      Oughterard&mdash;" He nodded, and she went on: "And, as I understand it,
      very much on <i>your</i> own conditions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is to say, I'm not to damage the Tories more than I can help, nor to
      help the Radicals more than I must."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there any designation for the party you will thus belong to?" asked
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm not exactly sure that there is; perhaps they 'd call me a Moderate
      Whig."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That sounds very nice and commonplace, but I don't like it. These are not
      times for moderation; nor would the part suit <i>you!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm certain of it. You have n't got habits of discipline to serve with a
      regular corps; to do anything, or be anything, you must command a partisan
      legion&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're right there; I know that," broke he in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mean it as flattery, but rather something a little bordering on
      the reverse," said she, fixing her eyes steadfastly on him; "for, after
      all, there is no great success&mdash;I mean, no towering success&mdash;to
      be achieved by such a line; but as I feel that you 'll not work&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; of that be assured!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then there are only secondary rewards to be won."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You certainly do not overestimate me!" said Jack, trying to seem
      perfectly indifferent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no desire to underrate your abilities," said she, calmly; "they
      are very good ones. You have great fluency,&mdash;great 'variety,' as
      Grattan would call it,&mdash;an excellent memory, and a most amiable
      self-possession."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove!" said he, reddening slightly, "you enumerate my little gifts
      with all the accuracy of an appraiser!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," resumed she, not heeding his interruption, "you have abundance of
      what is vulgarly styled 'pluck,' and which is to courage what <i>esprit</i>
      is to actual wit; and, lastly, you are a proficient in that readiness
      which the world always accepts for frankness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were right to say that you intended no flattery!" said he, with an
      effort to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to be truthful," rejoined she, calmly. "No praise of mine&mdash;however
      high it soared, or however lavishly it was squandered&mdash;could possibly
      raise you in your own esteem. The governess may perform the part of the
      slave in the triumphal chariot, but could not aspire to put the crown on
      the conqueror!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I have not conquered!" said Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may, whenever you enter the lists; you must, indeed, if you only care
      to do so. Go in for an Irish borough," said she, with renewed animation.
      "Arm yourself with all the popular grievances; there is just faction
      enough left to last <i>your</i> time. Discuss them in your own way, and my
      word for it, but you 'll succeed. It will be such a boon to the House to
      hear a gentlemanlike tone on questions which have always been treated in
      coarser guise. For a while you 'll have no imitators, and can sneer at the
      gentry and extol the 'people' without a competitor. Now and then, too, you
      can assail the Treasury benches, where your father is sitting; and nothing
      will so redound to your character for independence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, where, in Heaven's name," cried Jack, "have you got up all this?
      What and how do you know anything of party and politics?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I not been studying 'Hansard' and the files of the 'Times' for the
      last week by your directions? Have I not read lives of all the illustrious
      prosers you gave me to look through? And is it very wonderful if I have
      learned some of the secrets of this success, or that I should 'get up' my
      'politics' as rapidly as you can your 'principles'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I was even sure that I had done so," said Jack, laughing; "for
      this same address is puzzling me sadly! Now here, for instance," and he
      read aloud: "'While steadfastly upholding the rights of property,
      determined to maintain in all their integrity the more sacred rights of
      conscience&mdash;'Now just tell me, what do you understand by that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That rents must be paid,&mdash;occasionally, at least; but that you hope
      to pull down the Established Church!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, come," said he, "the thing will perhaps do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't much like all this about 'the Palladium of the British
      Constitution, and the unbroken bulwark of our dearest liberties.' We are
      in Ireland, remember, where we care no more for your Palladium&mdash;if we
      ever knew what it meant&mdash;than we do for the 'Grand Lama.' A slight
      dash of what is called 'nationality' would be better; very vague, very
      shadowy, of course. Bear in mind what Lady Dorothea told us last night
      about the charm of the king's bow. Everybody thought it specially meant
      for himself; it strikes me that something of this sort should pervade an
      election address."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to Heaven you 'd write it, then," said Jack, placing a pen in her
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something in this fashion," said she, while her hands traced the lines
      rapidly on the paper:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Finding that a new era is about to dawn in the political state of
      Ireland, when the consequences of late legislation will engender new
      conditions and relations, I present myself before you to solicit the honor
      of your suffrages, a perfect stranger to your town, but no stranger to the
      wants and necessities of that nationality which now, for the first time
      for centuries, is about to receive its due development.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or this, if you prefer it," said she, writing away rapidly as before:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The presumption of aspiring to your representation will, perhaps, be
      compensated when I come before you deeply impressed with the wrongs which
      centuries of legislation have enacted, and which, stranger as I am in
      Ireland, have arrested my attention and engaged my sympathies, impelling
      me to enter upon a public career; and, if favored by your approval, to
      devote whatever energy and capacity I may possess to your great and good
      cause.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like the first best," said Jack. "The new era and the results of the
      Relief Bill will be such appetizing suggestions. There must be an allusion
      to the Martins and their support."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather, however, as though <i>you</i> had brought over Martin to <i>your</i>
      views, than that <i>he</i> had selected you to represent his. In this
      wise:" and again she wrote,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It is with a just pride that I announce to you that in these professions
      I am strengthened by the cordial approval and support of one who, in his
      rank and station, and natural influence, is second to none in this great
      county; and who, whatever misconceptions have hitherto prevailed as to his
      views, is, heart and soul, a true patriot and an Irishman!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will puzzle him sorely to guess what line he should adopt to realize
      all this, and he'll have to come to <i>you</i> for his politics!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have caught up the cant of this peculiar literature perfectly," said
      Massingbred, as he pored over the papers she had just penned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me!" cried she, in a weary tone, "my great difficulty will be to
      discard its evil influence, and even write a common note like a reasonable
      being again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But come, confess frankly: you think that a political career is the only
      one worth embracing, and that any other life offers no reward worthy the
      name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you mistake me," said she. "It is the social position consequent
      upon success in a political life that I value,&mdash;the eminence it
      confers in the very highest and greatest circles. If I regarded the matter
      otherwise, I'd not be indifferent as to the line to follow&mdash;I 'd have
      great convictions, and hold them,&mdash;I mean, if I were <i>you</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then of course you consider me as one who has none such?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure I do. Men of your measures of ability can no more burden
      themselves with principles than a thoroughbred hackney can carry extra
      weight,&mdash;they 've quite enough to do to make their running without."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I shall certainly not be spoiled by flattery, at least from you,"
      said Jack, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They who know you less will make up for it all, depend upon it," said
      she, quietly. "Don't fancy, Mr. Massingbred," added she, with more
      earnestness of manner,&mdash;"don't fancy that I 'm insensible to the
      impertinences I have dared to address to you, or that I venture upon them
      without pain; but when I perceived that you would admit me to the liberty
      of criticising your conduct, character, and manners, I thought that I
      might render you good service by saying what better taste and better
      breeding would shrink from, and the only cost be the dislike of myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You took a very bad way to accomplish the latter," said Jack, fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did n't give it much consideration," said she, haughtily. "It was very
      little matter what opinion you entertained of 'the governess.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to convince you that you were wrong," said he, looking
      fixedly at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd find your task harder than you suspect, sir," said she, coldly.
      "There is a sense of pride about the humbleness of a station such as mine,
      as all the elevation of one in yours could never fathom. And," added she,
      in a still more determined tone, "there is but one condition on which this
      intercourse of ours can continue, which is, that this topic be never
      resumed between us. The gulf that separates your position in life from
      mine is the security for mutual frankness; to attempt to span it over by
      deception would be to build a bridge that must break down the first moment
      of its trial. Enough of this! I'll take these," said she, gathering up the
      papers, "and copy them out clearly. They ought to be with the printer
      to-morrow; and, indeed, you should not defer your canvass."
    </p>
    <p>
      Massingbred made no answer, but sat with his head buried between his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd have you to visit the 'dear constituency' at once, Mr. Massingbred,"
      said she, with a slight touch of scorn in her voice. "They are not well
      bred enough to bear a slight!" And with this she left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like excessively to know the secret of this interest in my
      behalf," said Jack, as he arose and slowly walked the room. "It is not,
      unquestionably, from any high estimate of my capacity; as little is it
      anything bordering on regard; and yet," added he, after a pause, "there
      are moments when I half fancy she could care for me,&mdash;at least I know
      well that I could for <i>her</i>, Confound it!" cried he, passionately,
      "what a terrible barrier social station throws up! If she were even some
      country squire's daughter,&mdash;portionless as she is,&mdash;the notion
      would not be so absurd; but 'the governess!' and 'the steward!' what
      frightful figures to conjure up. No, no; that's impossible. One might do
      such a folly by retiring from the world forever, but that would be exactly
      to defeat the whole object of such a match. She is essentially intended
      for 'the world;' every gift and grace she possesses are such as only have
      their fitting exercise where the game of life is played by the highest,
      and for the heaviest stakes! But it is not to be thought of!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I found you at last?" cried Repton, entering the room. "They say the
      writ will be here on Monday, so that we 've not an hour to lose. Let us
      drive over to Oughterard at once, see the editor of the 'Intelligence,'
      call on Priest Rafferty, and that other fellow&mdash;the father of our
      young friend here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Nelligan," said Jack. "But I can't well visit <i>him</i>&mdash;there
      have been some rather unpleasant passages between us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! you told me something about it. He wanted you to fill a bail-bond, or
      do something or other, rather than shoot <i>me</i>. An unreasonable old
      rascal! Never mind; we shall come before him now in another character, and
      you 'll see that he'll be more tractable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The matter is graver than this," said Jack, musingly; "and our difference
      is serious enough to make intercourse impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall tell me all about it as we drive along,&mdash;that is, if it be
      brief and easy to follow, for my head is so full of election matters I
      don't desire a new element of complication. Step in now, and let us away."
      And with this he hurried Massingbred to the door, where a pony-phaeton was
      in waiting for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once on the road, Repton changed the conversation from the domain of
      politics, and talked entirely of the host and his family. There was a sort
      of constitutional frankness and familiarity about the old lawyer which all
      the astute habits and instincts of his profession had never mastered. Like
      a great many acute men, his passion for shrewd observation and keen remark
      overbore the prudent reserve that belongs to less animated talkers, and so
      he now scrupled not to dis-cuss Martin and his affairs to one who but a
      few days back had been a complete stranger amongst them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Jack heard him without much interest, but, as he continued, the
      subject attracted all his attention, full as it was of views of life and
      the world perfectly new and strange to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Massingbred's great astonishment, he learned that vast as the estates,
      and large as was the fortune of the Martins, that they were deeply
      encumbered with bond-debts and mortgages. The wasteful habits of the
      gentry generally, combined with great facilities for obtaining money at
      any emergency, had led to this universal indebtedness; and, in fact, as
      the lawyer expressed it, an old estate was supposed to be the victim of
      debt, as an elderly gentleman was liable to gout; nobody presuming to
      think that the tenure, in either case, was a whit the more precarious on
      account of the casualty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said Repton, as they reached a point of the road from which a view
      of the country could be obtained for miles on every side&mdash;"now, as
      far as you can see belongs to Martin. Beyond that mountain yonder, too,
      there is a large tract&mdash;not very productive, it is true&mdash;extending
      to the sea. The fine waving surface to your left is all tillage land; and
      the islands in the bay are his. It is really a princely estate, with even
      greater hidden resources than those palpable and open to view. But, were I
      to show it to you on a map, and point out at the same time every spot on
      which some moneylender has a claim&mdash;how much has been advanced upon
      this&mdash;what sums have been lent upon that&mdash;you 'd be more amazed
      at the careless ease of the proprietor than you now are at the extent of
      his fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he is spending immensely in improving and developing the property,"
      said Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course he is, sir. That new-fangled notion of 'gentleman-farming '&mdash;which
      has come to us from countries where there are no gentlemen&mdash;won't
      suit Ireland, at least in the present generation. What <i>we</i> want here
      is, not to make more money, but to learn how to spend less; and although
      the first very often teaches the last, it is a hard way for an Irishman to
      acquire his knowledge. There's your borough, sir,&mdash;that little spot
      in the valley yonder is Oughterard. Do you feel, as you behold it, as
      though it were to be the mainspring of a great career? Is there an
      instinctive throb within that says, 'The honorable member for Oughterard
      will be a great name in the "Collective Wisdom "'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can scarcely say yes to that appeal," said Jack, smiling; "though, if
      what you have just told me of the mediocrity of public men be true&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you doubt it? You have them all before you,&mdash;their lives, their
      sayings, and their doings. Show me one in the whole mass who has
      originated a new idea in politics, or developed a new resource in the
      nation. Do they exhibit the common inventiveness displayed in almost every
      other walk of life, or do they even dress up their common platitudes in
      any other garb than the cast-off clothes of their predecessors? Mediocrity
      is a flattery when applied to them. But what's this coming along behind
      us, with such clattering of hoofs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A tandem, I think," said Jack, looking backward, "and very well handled,
      too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that illustrious attorney, Mr. Scanlan, I 've no doubt. Let us draw
      up till he passes." And so saying, Repton moved to one side of the road,
      giving a wide space for the other to proceed on his way. Mr. Scanlan,
      however, had subdued his nags, by a low, soft whistle, to a half-trot,
      when, giving the reins to his servant, he descended and advanced to the
      carriage. "I've been in pursuit of you, gentlemen," said he, touching his
      hat courteously, "for the last four miles, and I assure you you 've given
      me a breathing heat of it. Mr. Martin requested me to hand you this note,
      sir," added he, addressing Repton, "which demands immediate attention."
    </p>
    <p>
      The note was marked "Instantaneous," and "Strictly private," on the cover,
      and Repton opened it at once. Its contents were as follows,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Dear Rep.,&mdash;The post has just arrived, with intelligence
     that Harry is coming home,&mdash;may be here within a week or
     so,&mdash;so that we must not go on with our present plans for
     the borough, as H., of course, will stand. Come back,
     therefore, at once, and let as talk over the matter
     together.

     "Yours, in haste,

     "G. M."
</pre>
    <p>
      "You know what this contains, perhaps?" said Repton, in a whisper to
      Scanlan. He nodded an assent, and the old lawyer re-read the note. "I
      don't see my way here quite clearly," added he, in the same subdued voice,
      to Scanlan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll stroll on and stretch my legs a bit," said Jack, springing out of
      the pony phaeton, and seeing that the others had some private matter of
      discussion; and Scanlan now drew nigh, while Repton informed him what the
      note contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a little too late for this now," said Scanlan, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you mean too late?" asked Repton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that Massingbred stands well with the people in the borough. They
      think that he 'll be more their man than Martin's, and, indeed, they 're
      so confident of it, I half suspect he has told them so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there has been no canvass as yet,&mdash;his address isn't even
      printed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There has been a correspondence, however," said Scanlan, with a knowing
      wink. "Take my word for it, Mr. Repton, he 's a deep fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you quite sure of this?&mdash;can you pledge yourself to its truth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only know that Father Rafferty said the night before last he was
      satisfied with him, and the one difficulty was about old Nelligan, who
      somehow is greatly incensed against Massingbred."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He 'd have no chance in the borough without us," said Repton,
      confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If old Dan would consent to spend the money, he'd be the member in spite
      of us," rejoined Scanlan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll not dispute local knowledge with you, sir," said Repton, peevishly.
      "Let us turn back at once. Where's Mr. Massingbred? I saw him standing on
      the hill yonder a few minutes ago; maybe, he 's strolling along the road
      in front." Repton moved forward to a rising spot of ground, from whence a
      wide view extended for a distance on every side, but no trace of
      Massingbred could be discovered. "What can have become of him?&mdash;has
      he turned towards Cro' Martin?" asked Repton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There he is," cried Scanlan, suddenly; "there he is, walking with
      Magennis. They're taking the short cut over the hills to Oughterard&mdash;that's
      unfortunate, too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, before they're in the town they'll be as thick as two pickpockets&mdash;see
      how they 're talking! I think, if I was to drive on, I'd catch them before
      they entered the town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so, then, Scanlan. Say that a sudden message from Mr. Martin recalled
      me, but that you'll drive him back with you to Cro' Martin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I to allude to the contents of the note, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think not; I opine it's best not to speak of it. Say, however, that
      something of importance has occurred at Cro' Martin, and suggest to him
      that the sooner he returns thither the better."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an amount of vacillation and uncertainty about Repton's manner
      as he uttered these few words that showed not only how gravely he regarded
      the crisis, but how totally unprepared he found himself for the emergency.
      Not so Scanlan, who took his seat once more on his lofty "buggy," and was
      soon spinning along the road at a pace of full twelve miles the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Repton drove back to Cro' Martin, he thought once, and not without
      humiliation, of his late lessons in statecraft to young Massingbred. "To
      fancy that I was instilling all these precepts at the very moment that he
      was countermining us. The young villain is a worthy son of his father! And
      how he will laugh at me, and make others laugh too! It will never do to
      drive him into opposition to us. Martin must consent to make the best of
      it, now, and accept him as his member,&mdash;for the present, at least.
      With time and good opportunity we can manage to trip up his heels, but,
      for the moment, there's no help for it." And with these not very consoling
      reflections he entered once more the grounds of Cro' Martin Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now turn to Massingbred, as, accompanied by Magennis, he walked at
      a rapid pace towards Oughterard. It needed but a glance at the figures,
      and the rate at which they moved, to see that these two men were bent upon
      an object.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you see the town now before you?" said Magennis. "It's not much
      above two miles, and by the road it is every step of six, or six and a
      half; and if we walk as we're doing now, we'll be there at least twenty
      minutes before them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what will Repton think of my leaving him in this fashion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That it was a bit of your usual eccentricity,&mdash;no more," said the
      other, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite certain of what you've just told me?" asked Jack, after a
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you that you shall have it from Hosey's own lips. He showed the
      post-mark on the back of the letter to Father Rafferty, and it was 'Cape
      Town, August 24.' Now, as Hosey knows young Martin's writing as well as
      any man, what doubt can there be about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By that calculation," said Jack, thoughtfully, "he might be here within
      the present month!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly what Father Neal said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A shrewd fellow that same Hosey must be to put things together in this
      fashion," said Jack. "Such a head as he has on his shoulders might n't be
      a bad counsellor at this moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just come and talk to him a bit," rejoined Magennis; "say you want to be
      trimmed about the whiskers, and he'll be a proud man to have you under his
      hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the committee are satisfied with my letter?" asked Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are, and they are not; but, on the whole, they think it's a step in
      the right direction to get anything out of the Martins, and, as Father
      Neal remarks, 'where we can pass with our head, we can put our whole body
      through.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what 's to be done about Nelligan? The breach with him is, I suspect,
      irreparable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, it was Nelligan himself moved the first resolution in the committee,
      that your address be accepted as embodying the views&mdash;he said the
      present views&mdash;of the liberal electors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You amaze me!" cried Massingbred; "and Joe, where was he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Joe is off to Dublin; there 's some examination or other he must attend.
      But old Dan is your friend, rely upon that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is inexplicable," muttered Jack to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We 'll go there, straight, the moment we get into the town. He 'll take
      it as a great compliment; and you can talk to him frankly and openly, for
      old Dan is a man to be trusted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I could guess at how this reconciliation has been effected,"
      muttered Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was your letter did it, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I never wrote one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, somebody else did, perhaps; at all events, Dan had an open letter
      in his hand when he addressed the committee, and said, 'After reading
      this, gentlemen,' said he, 'I can only say that I 'll not oppose Mr.
      Massingbred; and if the free and independent men of Oughterard ask me who
      is the man to represent them, I'll answer, he 's your man! And what's
      more, there 's my name down for two hundred pounds for the election, if it
      ever comes to be a contest!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is all very good, but very strange news," cried Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I can explain nothing of the mystery, if there be one. I only know
      what I heard and saw myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us go to his house, at all events," said Massingbred, who now
      suffered his companion to rattle on about the state of parties and
      politics in Oughterard, little heeding his remarks, and only bent on
      following out his own thoughts. "Give whom the slip?" asked he, suddenly
      catching at the last words of some observation of Magennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Martins, of course," resumed the other; "for, as Father Neal says,
      'if we can secure the borough for you, you can well afford to stand by <i>us</i>;
      but if you were only Martin's member, he 'd drop you whenever it suited
      him.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to-morrow, for instance, if his son should make his appearance!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so; and that's the very reason for not losing a minute about getting
      the Martins in for the cost. What can they say, after choosing you and
      putting you forward?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They might make a personal appeal to me,&mdash;a distinct request to give
      place to the son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And would n't you pay great attention to it?" said Magennis, in mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm not so very sure I 'd refuse," said Massingbred, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, then, you 'd better be candid enough to tell the electors so 'at
      once.' Look now, Mr. Massingbred," said he, coming to a dead halt, and
      standing directly in front of him; "we don't go the same road, not one
      step, till I hear from you, distinctly and plainly, what you mean to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is somewhat of a peremptory proceeding," replied Jack. "I think it
      would not be very unreasonable to allow a man in my situation a little
      time for reflection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reflect upon what?" cried Magennis. "Is it what politics you 'd be? If
      that's what you mean, I think you 'd better say nothing about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, Mac, you are not quite fair in this business; there <i>are</i>
      difficulties,&mdash;there are embarrassments very often in the way of
      doing things which we have made up our minds to do. Now, if I were
      perfectly certain that the liberal interest here could succeed in spite of
      Martin&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're sure of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll show it to you on paper. We 'd rather have Martin with us and no
      contest, because it's cheaper; but if it must come to money, we 'll do
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Satisfy me on that point, and I'm with you; there's my hand on't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Magennis grasped him in his own strong fingers to ratify the contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      While "Mac" went on to give some insight into the views and wishes of his
      party, they reached the town and entered the main street, and held their
      way towards old Nelligan's shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's Father Neal's pony at the door," said Mac, as they approached the
      shop; "so we'll find them both together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I scarcely think I can enter here," said Massingbred, "after what passed
      last between us. We surely did not part as friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How little you know about us at all!" said Mac. "Old Dan bears you no
      malice, I 'd lay fifty pounds on it! But, if you like, I 'll just step in
      and take soundings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so, then," said Massingbred, not sorry to have even a few moments to
      himself for quiet thought and consideration. He was still standing, and
      deeply engrossed by his reflections, when he was aroused by hearing his
      name called aloud, and, on looking up, perceived Magennis beckoning to him
      from a window overhead. In obedience to the signal, Jack turned and
      entered the shop, where his friend quickly joined him. "Old Dan is in his
      bed, with a heavy cold and a rheumatism, but he 'll see you; and Father
      Neal's with him, and Hayes, besides." And with this information he hurried
      Jack up the stairs, and led him into a darkened room, where the figures of
      the priest and old Hayes were dimly discernible. Before Massingbred had
      well crossed the door-sill, Nelligan called out, "Your servant, Mr.
      Massingbred. I 'm more than pleased with your explanation. Let me shake
      your hand once more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not quite sure that I understand you," said Jack, in a low voice; but
      before he could continue, the priest advanced to greet him, followed by
      old Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wasn't I in luck to catch him on the road this morning?" said Magennis;
      "he was coming in with the old Counsellor, and just got out to walk up a
      hill&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember," said Jack, "that I have few minutes to spare, for I must be in
      waiting about the market-place when he drives in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must have a conference, though," said Father Neal; "there 's much to
      be settled. First of all, are we to coalesce for the representation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, no!" cried Nelligan. "We 'll have it our own way. If Mr.
      Massingbred will be our Member, we want no help from the Martins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There 's five pounds, and I 'll make it guineas if you like," said old
      Hayes, putting a note upon the table; "but the devil a Whig or Tory will
      ever get more out of Peter Hayes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A very good-natured laugh from the others showed how little umbrage the
      frank avowal excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We 'll not want for money, Peter, make your mind easy about that," said
      Dan. "When can you meet the committee, Mr. Massingbred? Could you say
      to-night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better to-morrow morning. I must return to Cro' Martin this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly,&mdash;of course," said Father Neal, blandly. "You 'll have to
      come to an understanding with Mr. Martin about the borough, declare what
      your principles are, and how, upon very mature consideration, you find you
      can't agree with the opinions of himself and his party."
    </p>
    <p>
      Magennis winked significantly at Jack, as though to say, "Listen to <i>him;
      he 's</i> the man to instruct and direct you;" and the priest resumed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on to explain that your only utility in the House could arise from
      your being the exponent of what you feel to be the truth about Ireland,
      the crying evils of the Established Church, and the present tenure of
      land! When you throw these two shells in, sir, the town will be on fire.
      He 'll reply that under these circumstances there 's no more question
      about your standing for the borough; you'll say nothing,&mdash;not a word,
      not a syllable; you only smile. If Repton 's by&mdash;and he 's likely to
      be&mdash;he 'll get hot, and ask you what you mean by that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There 's Scanlan just driving round the corner," said Magennis, in a
      whisper; and Massingbred arose at once and drew nigh to the bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could I say one word to you alone, Mr. Nelligan?" said he, in a low
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," said he. And whispering the priest to take the others into an
      adjoining room, old Nelligan motioned Jack to sit down beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said, as I came in," said Jack, "that you were satisfied with my
      explanation&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure I was," broke in Dan. "All I wanted to know was, that you
      acted under a misconception. That being once explained, there was no
      offence on either side. Now, Catty Henderson's letter to my wife put the
      thing straight at once; she showed that <i>your</i> conduct at Cro' Martin
      arose out of a notion that Joe had slighted you."
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0011" id="linkimage-0011">
      <!-- IMG --></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/302.jpg" width="100%" alt="302 " />
    </div>
    <p>
      "Have you got this letter?" asked Jack, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, then, I have not; his mother forwarded it to Joe by the same
      post; but, as I tell you I 'm satisfied, there 's an end of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scanlan 's asking for you below stairs," said Magennis, putting in his
      head; "and I hear them saying that they didn't see you in town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," said Jack; "so I'll just slip out by the garden gate and meet
      him in the market-square." And with a hurried leave-taking Jack withdrew,
      his mind very far from that state of tranquil composure in which it was
      his pride to affect that he invariably revelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There they go!" cried Father Neal, shortly after, as Scanlan drove
      rapidly by, with Massingbred beside him. "Maybe Master Maurice won't abuse
      us all round before he turns in at the gate of Cro' Martin!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Massingbred is too cute to mind him," said Magennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Tom, there 's one appeal men of his stamp are never deaf to. You may
      say fifty things that won't shock them in religion or morals or good
      taste; but only utter the one word 'vulgar,' and their indignation rises
      at once. That's what Scanlan will do, take my word for it He 'll call us a
      low set of fellows, that have no position in society,&mdash;no acceptance
      anywhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Massingbred is a gentleman born, and he won't be led astray by such a
      consideration."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is exactly for that very reason that he will," said the priest,
      stoutly. "It's a strange fact, but there 's no manner of man rates social
      advantages so high as he that has them by right, and without any struggle
      for them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said old Hayes, slowly, "if I once thought that of him, the devil
      a vote of mine he 'd get, no matter what his principles were."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there you 're wrong, Peter," said Nelligan. "Matters of good manners
      and breeding need never be discussed between us. Mr. Massingbred will have
      <i>his</i> station; we'll have <i>ours</i>. There 's a long and weary road
      before us ere we come to think of our social condition. There 's many a
      cruel statute to be abolished, many a hard grievance to be redressed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And besides that," said Father Neal, with a shrewd twinkle in his eye,
      "while we 're doing the one we 'll be helping on the other. Political
      influence always did, and always will, include rank and station in the
      world. When English Ministers find their best ally in the Irish Priest,
      there will be no more sneers at his brogue nor his boots. Men of family
      and fortune won't shrink from their contact, and maybe you 'll see the day
      yet when coaches and chariots will drive up to the chapel, and ladies in
      satin and velvet step out to hear Mass."
    </p>
    <p>
      A prophetic view of the Millennium itself could not have astonished old
      Peter Hayes more completely than did this marvellous suggestion of Father
      Neal; and he moved away muttering a "Heaven grant it!" between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's the next meeting of the committee to be?" asked Nelligan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the Chapel House, to-morrow, at eleven. And that reminds me I 've not
      sent out the summonses." And so saying, Father Neal hastily took leave of
      his friends and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us take a glance at Mr. Maurice Scanlan, as, with an extra box-coat
      ingeniously wrapped around his lower man, he discoursed pleasantly to his
      companion while he "tooled" along towards Cro' Martin. Not a word of
      politics, not a syllable on the subject of party, escaped him as he
      talked. His conversation was entirely of sporting matters: the odds
      against Leander, the last bettings on "Firebrand," whether Spicy Bill was
      really in bad training, as the knowing ones said, and if the course
      wouldn't "puzzle the young ones" if the wet weather were to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massingbred was sufficiently well versed in these classic themes to be an
      amusing and even instructive companion, and communicated many a sly piece
      of intelligence that would have been deemed priceless in "Bell's Life;"
      and Scanlan quickly conceived a high estimate for one who had graduated at
      Newmarket, and taken honors at Goodwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After the kind of life you 've led in England, I wonder how you endure
      this country at all," said Maurice, with real sincerity of voice and
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like it," said Jack; "the whole thing is new to me, and vastly amusing.
      I don't mean to say I 'd willingly pass a lifetime in this fashion, but
      for a few weeks&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so; to give you a better relish for the real thing when you go back
      again," said Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a neat stepper that leader is!" said Jack, to change the topic from
      himself and his own affairs. "She's a well-bred one; that's clear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nearly full-bred; the least bit of cocktail in the world. She's out of
      Crescent, that ran a very good third for the Oaks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A strong horse, and a very honest one," said Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I bought that little mare from young Mr. Martin&mdash;the Captain&mdash;when
      he was ordered out to India; I put her in training, and ran her at the
      Curragh in three weeks, and won, too, the St. Lawrence Handicap."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Captain Martin a sporting character?" asked Jack, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is and he is not," said Scanlan, half querulously. "He likes a safe
      thing,&mdash;do you understand?" and he gave a most significant wink as he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, then he's close about money matters?" said Massingbred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not exactly that. He 's wasteful and spendthrift, but he'd go to the
      world's end to do a knowing thing; you 've seen men of that kind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scores of them," replied Jack; "and they were always the easiest fellows
      to be duped!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly my own experience," said Scanlan, delighted to find his opinions
      confirmed in such a quarter. "Now, young Martin would give five hundred
      pounds for a horse to win a fifty pound cup. Don't you know what I mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly," said Massingbred, with an approving smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody knows the sums he has drawn since he went away," exclaimed
      Scanlan, who was momentarily growing more and more confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There 's a deal of high play in India; perhaps he gambles," said Jack,
      carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A significant wink and nod gave the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well," added he, after a pause, "he 'll not mend matters by coming
      back again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is he about to visit England?" asked Massingbred, in the same easy
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So they say," replied Scanlan, with an effort at the easy indifference of
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On leave, perhaps?" said Jack, indolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That 's more than I know," replied he, and relapsed into a thoughtful
      silence, during which Massingbred continued to scan his features with a
      sly, downcast glance peculiar to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've never been in Leicestershire, Mr. Scanlan?" said he, when he had
      fully satisfied himself with his examination. "Well, then, come over there
      in the spring&mdash;say about March next&mdash;and pay me a visit. I 've
      got a sort of hunting-box there, with a neat stable, and by that time I
      hope to raise funds for a couple of nags."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trust <i>me</i> for the horseflesh, sir. I know where to mount you this
      very minute. You 're not much above eleven stone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eleven-eight,&mdash;at least, so I used to be. Is it a bargain? Will you
      come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's my hand on't," said the attorney, overjoyed at the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mackworth, and Lord Harry Coverdale, and Sir Went-worth Danby, and a few
      more, are all my neighbors. Capital fellows, whom you 'll be delighted
      with. Just the sort of men to suit you,&mdash;up to everything that means
      sport."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly what I like!" cried Maurice, in ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll arrange it all this evening, then," said Jack. "Just drop into my
      room after they 're all gone to bed, and we'll have a talk over it. You
      don't know my father, do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't that honor," said Scanlan, with an accent of real deference in
      his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another kind of person from these I've mentioned," said Jack, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I should suppose, sir," said Scanlan, a tone of respect involuntarily
      attaching itself to him as he addressed the son of a Secretary of State.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that he doesn't like field sports, and all the enjoyments of a
      country life. But, you know, he's an old official&mdash;a Downing Street
      veteran&mdash;who really relishes public business, just as you and I would
      a coursing-match, or a heavy pool at Crocky's."
    </p>
    <p>
      Scanlan nodded as if in perfect assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "While I say this, it's only fair to add that he has most excellent
      qualities, and is a stanch friend when he takes any one up. I suspect you
      'd like him. I know he 'd like your&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm greatly flattered. I don't deserve&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see," said Jack, not heeding the interruption, and assuming the low
      accents of a confidential communication&mdash;"You see, he and I have not
      been on the very best of terms for some time back; I 've done some silly
      things&mdash;spent a little more money than he liked&mdash;and, what was
      still worse in his eyes, refused a first-rate Government appointment&mdash;a
      really good thing, and such as one does n't meet with every day&mdash;and
      now, the only road back to his favor will be for me to come out strongly
      in some shape, either as a college prizeman or in public life. I despise
      the former. It's all very well for fellows like Nelligan&mdash;it's their
      natural 'beat,'&mdash;but for a man like <i>me</i>, one who has seen the
      world,&mdash;the real world,&mdash;these are nothing more than schoolboy
      distinctions,&mdash;the silver medal he brings home of a Saturday, and
      makes him the wonder of his sisters for twenty-four hours. I'll have to
      strike out a line of my own!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No fear of you, sir,&mdash;devil a bit!" said Maurice, with a sententious
      shake of the head. "Here we are now at Cro' Martin, and then there's the
      first dinner-bell ringing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall be late, perhaps," said Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll be in good time. As for me, I haven't been asked to dinner, so
      that when I drop you I 'll go down to the village."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, I 'll walk over and see you in the evening," said
      Massingbred. "It seems to me&mdash;I don't know whether you are of the
      same opinion, though&mdash;but it seems strongly to me that you and I
      ought to be allies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I thought I was worthy&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, Scanlan, no modesty, old boy. You know you 're a devilish
      clever fellow, and you no more intend to pass your life cruising after
      petty-session practice in Galway, than I do to settle down here as
      under-gardener."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They 're all looking at us, sir, from the drawing-room window," said
      Scanlan, in a cautious voice; "don't let us appear too confidential." And
      at the same instant he extended his whip as though to point attention to
      some distant object, and seem as if he were describing the scenery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shrewd dog it is," muttered Massingbred in soliloquy, but taking good
      care to be overheard. "I 'll beat up your quarters, Scanlan, in a couple
      of hours or so," said Massingbred, as he descended from the lofty "drag."
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat, but not very much, later than the time appointed, Jack
      Massingbred appeared in the small chamber of the "Crueskeen,"&mdash;the
      humble hostel on the roadside adjoining the demesne of Cro' Martin.
      Maurice Scanlan had made every preparation which the fluid resources of
      the house admitted to receive his guest, but they were not destined to be
      put in requisition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have only come lest you should accuse me of forgetting you, Scanlan,"
      said Massingbred, as he stood in the doorway without removing his hat. "I
      'm off to Oughter-ard, having made my adieux at Cro' Martin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Left Cro' Martin, and for good!" exclaimed Scanlan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If that means forever, I suspect you 're right," replied Jack; "but you
      'll have the whole story in the morning when you go up there, and
      doubtless more impartially than I should tell it. And now, good-bye for a
      brief space. We shall meet soon." And, without waiting for an answer, he
      nodded familiarly, stepped briskly to the door, where a post-chaise
      awaited him, and was gone, before Scanlan had even half recovered from his
      astonishment and surprise.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. AN AWKWARD VISITOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is a singularly impressive sensation, and one, too, of which even
      frequency will scarcely diminish the effect, to pass from the busy streets
      and moving population of Dublin, and enter the quiet courts of the
      University. The suddenness of the change is most striking, and you pass at
      once from all the bustling interests of life&mdash;its cares and
      ambitions, its pursuits of wealth and pleasure&mdash;into the stillness of
      a cloister. Scarcely within the massive gates, and the noise of the great
      capital is hushed and subdued, its sounds seem to come from afar, and in
      their place is an unbroken calm, or the more solemn echoes of its vaulted
      roofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a corner of the Old Square, and in a building almost entirely occupied
      by the University authorities, and whose stairs had seldom echoed beneath
      less reverend footsteps than those of deans and bursars, were the chambers
      of Joe Nelligan. He had obtained them in this peculiar locality as a
      special favor from "the Board," as eminently suited to his habits of study
      and seclusion; for his was indeed a life of labor,&mdash;labor, hard,
      unremitting, and unbroken! Dreary as was the aspect of the spot, it was
      one dear to the heart of him who occupied it. If it had been the cell
      wherein he had passed nights of severest toil and days of intense effort,
      so had it been the calm retreat into which he had retired as a sanctuary,
      and at times the scene of the hallowed joy he felt when success had
      crowned all his labors. Thither had he bent his steps at nightfall, as to
      a home; thence had he written the few lines which more than once announced
      his triumph to his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within those halls had he experienced all that he had ever tasted of
      successful ambition, and in the depths of that old chair had he dreamed
      away all the visions of a glorious future. The room in which he sat was a
      large and lofty one, lighted by two windows deeply set in the wall. Its
      sides were lined with book-shelves, and books littered the tables and even
      the floor,&mdash;for it was one of his caprices to read as he lay at full
      length, either on the ground or a sofa,&mdash;and the paper and pens were
      scattered about in different quarters, as accident suggested. The only
      thing like ornament to be seen was a lithographic print of Cro' Martin
      Castle over the fireplace,&mdash;a strange exception would it seem, but
      traceable, perhaps, to some remote scene of boyish admiration for what had
      first awakened in him a feeling of awe and admiration; and there it now
      remained, time-worn and discolored, perhaps unnoticed, or looked on with
      very different emotions. Ay! these pictures are terrible landmarks of our
      thoughts! I speak not of such as appeal to our hearts by the features we
      loved, the eyes into whose depths we have gazed, the lips on whose accents
      we have hung entranced, but even when they trace the outlines of some spot
      well known to us in boyhood,&mdash;some scene of long, long years ago. It
      is not alone that the "Then" and "Now" stand out in strongest contrast,
      that what we were and what we are are in juxtaposition, but that whole
      memories of what we once hoped to be come rushing over us, and all the
      spirit-stirring emotions of early ambitions mingle themselves with the
      stern realities of the present. And, after all, what success in life,
      however great and seemingly unexpected it may be, ever equals one of the
      glorious daydreams of our boyish ambition, in which there comes no alloy
      of broken health, wasted energies, and exhausted spirits? or, far worse
      again, the envious jealousy of those we once deemed friends, and who, had
      we lived obscurely, still might be such? Student life is essentially
      imaginative. The very division of time, the objects which have value to a
      student's eyes, the seclusion in which he lives, the tranquil frame of
      mind coexistent with highly strained faculties, all tend to make his
      intervals of repose periods of day-dream and revery. It is not improbable
      that these periods are the fitting form of relaxation for overtaxed minds,
      and that the Imagination is the soothing influence that repairs the wear
      and tear of Reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peculiar circumstances of young Nelligan's position in life had almost
      totally estranged him from others. The constraint that attaches to a very
      bashful temperament had suggested to him a certain cold and reserved
      manner, that some took for pride, and many were repelled from his intimacy
      by this seeming haughtiness. The unhappy course of what had been his first
      friendship&mdash;for such was it with Massingbred&mdash;had rendered him
      more distrustful than ever of himself, and more firmly convinced that to
      men born as he had been the world imposes a barrier that only is passable
      by the highest and greatest success. It is true, his father's letter of
      explanation assuaged the poignancy of his sorrow; he saw that Massingbred
      had proceeded under a misconception, and had believed himself the
      aggrieved individual; but all these considerations could not obliterate
      the fact that an insult to his social station was the vengeance adopted by
      him, and that Massingbred saw no more galling outrage in his power than to
      reflect upon his rank in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are men who have a rugged pride in contrasting what they were with
      what they are. Their self-love finds an intense pleasure in contemplating
      difficulties overcome, obstacles surmounted, and a goal won, all by their
      own unaided efforts, and to such the very obscurity of their origin is a
      source of boastful exultation. Such men are, however, always found in the
      ranks of those whose success is wealth. Wherever the triumphs are those
      rewarded by station, or the distinctions conferred on intellectual
      superiority, this vainglorious sentiment is unknown. An inborn refinement
      rejects such coarse pleasure, just as their very habits of life derive no
      enjoyment from the display and splendor reflected by riches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe Nelligan felt his lowly station most acutely, because he saw in it a
      disqualification for that assured and steady temperament which can make
      most of success. He would have given half of all he might possess in the
      world for even so much of birth as might exempt him from a sneer. The
      painful sensitiveness that never rested nor slept&mdash;that made him
      eternally on the watch lest some covert allusion might be made to him&mdash;was
      a severe suffering; and far from decreasing, it seemed to grow with him as
      he became older, and helped mainly to withdraw him further from the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      No error is more common than for bashful men to believe that they are
      unpopular in society, and that the world "will none of them." They
      interpret their own sense of difficulty as a feeling of dislike in others,
      and retire to their solitudes convinced that these are their fitting
      dwelling-places. To this unpalatable conviction was Joseph Nelligan now
      come; and as he entered his chambers, and closed the heavy door behind
      him, came the thought: "Here at least no mortifications can reach me.
      These old books are my truest and best of friends, and in their
      intercourse there is neither present pain nor future humiliation!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on a dark and dreary day in winter, and in that cheerless hour
      before the closing in of night, that Joseph sat thus in his solitary home.
      The sound of carriage-wheels and the sharp tramp of horses' feet&mdash;a
      rare event in these silent courts&mdash;slightly aroused him from a
      revery; but too indolent to go to the window, he merely raised his head to
      listen; and now a loud knock shook the outer door of his chambers. With a
      strange sense of perturbation at this unwonted summons, he arose and
      opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Chief Secretary begs to know if Mr. Nelligan is at home?" said a
      well-powdered footman, in a plain but handsome livery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I am the person," said Joseph, with a diffidence strongly in
      contrast with the composure of the other; and while he yet stood, door in
      hand, the steps of the carriage were let down, and a tall
      venerable-looking man, somewhat past the prime of life, descended and
      approached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must be my own introducer, Mr. Nelligan," said he; "my name is
      Massingbred."
    </p>
    <p>
      With considerable confusion of manner, and in all that hurry in which
      bashful men seek to hide their awkwardness, Joseph ushered his visitor
      into his dimly lighted chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Massingbred, with all the staid composure of a very quiet
      demeanor, had quite sufficient tact to see that he was in the company of
      one little versed in the world, and, as soon as he took his seat,
      proceeded to explain the reason of his visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son has told me of the great pleasure and profit he has derived from
      knowing you, sir," said he; "he has also informed me that a slight and
      purely casual event interrupted the friendship that existed between you;
      and although unable himself to tender personally to you at this moment all
      his regrets on the subject, he has charged me to be his interpreter, and
      express his deep sorrow for what has occurred, and his hope that, after
      this avowal, it may never be again thought of by either of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was a misunderstanding,&mdash;a fault on both sides. I was wrong in
      the first instance," said Nelligan, faltering and stammering at every
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Nelligan is in a position to be generous," said the Colonel, blandly,
      "and he cannot better show the quality than by accepting a frank and full
      apology for a mere mistake. May I trust," continued he,&mdash;but with
      that slight change of tone that denoted a change of topic,&mdash;"that you
      have somewhat abated those habits of severe study you have hitherto
      pursued? Jack is really uneasy on that score, and wisely remarks that
      great talents should be spared the penalty of great labor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not reading now. I have read very little of late," said Joseph,
      diffidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can imagine what that means," said the Colonel, smiling. "Mr.
      Nelligan's relaxations would be the hard labor of less zealous students;
      but I will also say that upon other grounds this must be done with more
      consideration. The public interests, Mr. Nelligan,&mdash;the country, to
      whose service you will one day be called on to contribute those high
      abilities,&mdash;will not be satisfied to learn that their exercise should
      have been impaired by over-effort in youth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You overrate me much, sir. I fear that you have been misled both as to my
      capacity and my objects."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your capacity is matter of notoriety, Mr. Nelligan! your objects may be
      as high as any ambition can desire. But perhaps it is obtrusive in one so
      new to your acquaintance to venture on these topics; if so, pray forgive
      me, and set it down to the error I have fallen into of fancying that I
      know you as well personally as I do by reputation and character."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Nelligan could summon words to reply to this complimentary speech,
      the door of his room was flung suddenly open, and a short, thickset
      figure, shrouded in a coarse shawl and a greatcoat, rushed towards him,
      exclaiming in a rich brogue,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here I am, body and bones; just off the coach, and straight to your
      quarters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! Mr. Crow; is it possible?" cried Nelligan, in some confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just himself, and no other," replied the artist, disengaging himself from
      his extra coverings. "When you said to me, 'Come and see me when you visit
      Dublin,' I said to myself, 'There 's a trump, and I 'll do it;' and so
      here I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You left the country yesterday. Did you bring me any letters?" asked
      Nelligan; but in the uncertain tone of a man who talked merely to say
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a line,&mdash;not a word. Your father was over head and ears at work
      this week back about the election, and it was only the night before last
      it was over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is it over?" asked Nelligan, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure it is. Young Massingbred is in, and a nice business it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me inform you, Mr. Crow, before you proceed further&mdash;" broke in
      Nelligan; but as he got so far, Colonel Massingbred laid his hand on his
      arm, and said, in a bland but steady voice, "Pray allow the gentleman to
      continue; his account promises to be most interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, then, that's what it is not," said Crow; "for I think it's all
      bad from beginning to end." Another effort to interrupt by Nelligan being
      repressed by the Colonel, Crow resumed: "Everybody trying to cheat
      somebody else; the Martins wanting to cheat the borough, the borough
      wanting to jockey the Martins, and then young Massingbred humbugging them
      both! And there he is now, Member for Oughterard; and much he cares for
      them both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was there a contest, sir?" asked the Colonel, while by a gesture he
      enforced silence on Nelligan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As bitter a one as ever you saw in your life," continued Simmy, quite
      flattered at the attention vouchsafed him; "for though the Martins put
      young Massingbred forward at first, they quarrelled with him before the
      day for the nomination,&mdash;something or other about the franchise, or
      Maynooth, or the Church Establishment. Sorra one o' me know much about
      these matters; but it was a serious difference, and they split about it!
      And after all their planning and conniving together, what do they do but
      propose Martin's son, the man in the dragoons, for the borough!
      Massingbred bids them do their worst, packs up, sets out for the town, and
      makes a speech exposing them all! The next morning he comes to the poll,
      with Joe's father there, and Peter Hayes, to propose and second him.
      Martin drives in with three elegant coaches and four, and tries to do the
      thing 'grand.' 'It's too late, sir; the people know their power,' as
      Father Neal told them; and, upon my conscience, I believe it's a most
      dangerous kind of knowledge. At all events, at it they go; and such
      fighting and murdering nobody ever saw before. There's not a whole pane of
      glass in the town, and many a skull cracked as well! One of the wickedest
      of the set was young Massingbred himself; he 'd assault the cars as they
      drove in, and tear out the chaps he thought were his own voters, in spite
      of themselves. He has the spirit of the devil in him! And then to hear how
      he harangued the people and abused the aristocracy. Maybe he did n't lay
      it on well! To be sure, the Martins drove him to it very hard. They called
      him a 'renegade' and a 'spy.' They ransacked everything they could get
      against his character, and at last declared that he had no qualification,
      and wasn't worth sixpence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how did he answer that?" cried the Colonel, who, fixing his eyes on
      the other, entirely engaged his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll tell you how he did. Just producing the title-deeds of an estate
      that old Nelligan settled on him eight days before,&mdash;ay, and so well
      and securely that Counsellor Repton himself, with all his cuteness, could
      n't find a flaw in it. Repton said, in my own hearing, 'That 's the
      cleverest blackguard in Ireland!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Crow&mdash;Crow, I say," broke in young Nelligan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray don't interrupt him," said the Colonel, in a tone that seemed to
      demand obedience; "I want to learn by what majority he gained the day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thirty-eight or thirty-nine; and there's only two hundred and odd in the
      borough. There may be, perhaps, a dozen of these to strike off on a
      petition; but he 's all safe after that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And will they petition against his return?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They say so, but nobody believes them. His father,"&mdash;and here he
      made a gesture towards Nelligan,&mdash;"his father has a strong purse, and
      will see him well through it all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is very interesting news to me, sir," said the Colonel, with another
      sign to Joseph not to betray him; "for although I could well imagine Jack
      Massingbred equal to such an occasion as you describe, I was scarcely
      prepared to hear of the generous confidence reposed in him, nor the prompt
      and able co-operation of the Liberal party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I perceive," said Crow, with a significant motion of his eyebrows.
      "You thought that his name would be against him, and that people would
      say, 'Is n't he the son of old Moore Massingbred, that took his bribe for
      the Union?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is intolerable," cried Nelligan, starting up from his seat and
      speaking with all the vehemence of outraged feelings. "It is to Colonel
      Massingbred himself you have dared to address this impertinence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What&mdash;how&mdash;what's this!" exclaimed Crow, in a perfect horror of
      shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fault, if there be any, is all mine, sir," said the Colonel, pressing
      him down into his seat. "I would not have lost the animated description
      you have just given me, uttered, as it was, in such perfect frankness, for
      any consideration; least of all, at the small price of hearing a public
      expression on a public man's conduct. Pray, now, continue to use the same
      frankness, and tell me anything more that occurs to you about this
      remarkable contest."
    </p>
    <p>
      This appeal, uttered in all the ease of a well-bred manner, was quite
      unsuccessful. Mr. Crow sat perfectly horrified with himself, endeavoring
      to remember what possible extent of offence he might have been betrayed
      into by his narrative. As for Nelligan, his shame and confusion were even
      greater still; and he sat gazing ruefully and reproachfully at the unlucky
      painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Massingbred made one or two more efforts to relieve the
      awkwardness of the incident, but so palpably fruitless were the attempts
      that he desisted, and arose to take his leave. As Joe accompanied him to
      the door, he tried to blunder out some words of excuse. "My dear Mr.
      Nelligan," broke in the other, with a quiet laugh, "don't imagine for a
      moment that I am offended. In the first place, your friend was the bearer
      of very pleasant tidings, for Jack has not condescended to write to me
      about his success; and secondly, public life is such a stern schoolmaster,
      that men like myself get accustomed to rather rough usage, particularly at
      the hands of those who do not know us. And now, as I am very unwilling to
      include you in this category, when will you come and see me? What day will
      you dine with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nelligan blushed and faltered, just as many another awkward man has done
      in a similar circumstance; for, however an easy matter for you, my dear
      sir, with all your tact and social readiness, to fix the day it will suit
      you to accept of an almost stranger's hospitality, Joseph had no such
      self-possession, and only stammered and grew crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall it be on Saturday? for to-morrow I am engaged to the Chancellor,
      and on Friday I dine with his Excellency. Will Saturday suit you?" asked
      the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, perfectly; with much pleasure," answered Nelligan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then Saturday be it, and at seven o'clock," said Massingbred, shaking his
      hand most cordially; while Joe, with sorrowful step, returned to his
      chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I think I did it there, at all events!" cried Simmy, as the other
      entered. "But what, in the name of all that's barefaced, prevented your
      stopping me? Why did n't you pull me up short before I made a beast of
      myself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could I? You rushed along like a swollen river. You were so full of
      your blessed subject that you would n't heed an interruption; and as to
      signs and gestures, I made twenty without being able to catch your eye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe I 'm the only man living ever does these things," said Simmy,
      ruefully. "I lost the two or three people that used to say they were my
      friends by some such blundering folly as this. I only hope it won't do <i>you</i>
      any mischief. I trust he 'll see that you are not responsible for my
      delinquencies!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a hearty sincerity in poor Simmy's sorrow that at once
      conciliated Nelligan, and he did his best to obliterate every trace of the
      unhappy incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I scarcely supposed my father would have forgiven Massingbred so easily,"
      said Joe, in his desire to change the topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blarney,&mdash;all blarney!" muttered Crow, with an expressive movement
      of his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father Neal himself is rather a difficult subject to treat with," added
      Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blarney again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor do I think," continued Nelligan, "that the constituency of the
      borough, as a body, are remarkable for any special liability to be imposed
      on!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor would they, had it been an Irishman was trying to humbug them," said
      Crow, emphatically. "Take my word for it,&mdash;and I 've seen a great
      deal of the world, and perhaps not the best of it either,&mdash;but take
      <i>my</i> word for it, English blarney goes further with us here than all
      else. It 's not that it's clever or insinuating or delicate,&mdash;far
      from it; but you see that nobody suspects it. The very blunders and
      mistakes of it have an air of sincerity, and we are, besides, so
      accustomed always to be humbugged with a brogue, that we fancy ourselves
      safe when we hear an English accent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's some ingenuity in your theory," said Joe, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's fact in it; that's what there is," said Crow, rising from his
      seat. "I 'll be going now, for I 'm to dine with Tom Magennis at six."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he here, too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; and was n't it a piece of good luck that I did n't say anything
      about him before Colonel Massingbred?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just for this, then,&mdash;that it was young Massingbred gave him a
      letter to his father, recommending him for some place or other. Half of
      the borough expects to be in the Treasury, or the Post-Office, or the
      Board of Trade; and I was just on the tip of saying what a set of
      rapscallions they were. I 'm sure I don't know what saved me from it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your natural discretion, doubtless," said Joe, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so; it must have been that!" replied he, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll breakfast with me to-morrow, Crow, at eight," said Nelligan, as he
      parted with him at the door. And Simmy, having pledged himself to be
      punctual, hurried off to keep his dinner appointment.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. A DAY "AFTER"
    </h2>
    <p>
      The reaction that succeeds to a period of festivity has always an air of
      peculiar sadness and gloom about it. The day after a ball, the withered
      flowers, the faded decorations, the disordered furniture,&mdash;all tell
      the tale of departed pleasure and past enjoyment. The afternoon of that
      morning which has witnessed a wedding-breakfast,&mdash;the April landscape
      of joy and grief, the bridal beauty, and the high-beating hope of the
      happy lover, have all fled; and in the still and silent chambers there
      seems to brood a sense of sorrow and mourning. Still with these thoughts
      happier memories are mingled. The bright pageant of the past rises again
      before the mind; and smiles and music and laughter and graceful forms come
      back, and people space with their images. But how different from all this
      was the day after the election at Cro' Martin!
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week had the Martins condescended to derogate from their proud
      station and "play popular" to the electors of Oughterard. They had opened
      their most sumptuous apartments to vulgar company, and made guests of
      those they deemed inferior to their own domestics. They had given dinners
      and suppers and balls and picnics. They had lavished all the flatteries of
      attentions on their rude neighbors. They had admitted them to all the
      privileges of a mock equality, "so like the real article as not to be
      detected." They had stored their minds with all the lives and adventures
      of these ignoble intimates, so as to impart a false color of friendship to
      their conversation with them; in a word, and to use one by which her
      Ladyship summed up all the miseries of the occasion, they had
      "demoralized" more in a week than she believed it possible could have been
      effected in ten years. Let us be just, and add that my Lady had taken the
      phrase bodily out of her French vocabulary, and in her ardor applied it
      with its native signification,&mdash;that is, she alluded to the sad
      consequences of association with underbred company, and not by any means
      to any inroads made upon her sense of honor and high principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, whatever pangs the sacrifice was costing within, it must be owned
      that no signs of them displayed themselves on the outside. Even Repton,
      stern critic as he was, said that "they did the thing well." And now it
      was all over, the guests gone, the festivities ended, the election lost,
      and nothing in prospect save to settle the heavy outlay of the contest,
      and pay the high price for that excessively dear article which combines
      contamination with disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her capacity of head of the administration, Lady Dorothea had assumed
      the whole guidance of this contest. With Miss Henderson as her private
      secretary, she had corresponded and plotted and bribed and intrigued to
      any extent; and although Repton was frequently summoned to a council, his
      advice was very rarely, if ever, adopted. Her Ladyship's happy phrase&mdash;"one
      ought to know their own borough people better than a stranger"&mdash;usually
      decided every vexed question in favor of her judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a strange characteristic of human nature that at no time do people
      inveigh so loudly against bad faith, treachery, and so on, as when
      themselves deeply engaged in some very questionable enterprise. Now her
      Ladyship had so fully made up her mind to win in this contest that she had
      silenced all scruples as to the means. She had set out with some
      comfortable self-assurance that she knew what was good for those "poor
      creatures" infinitely better than they did. That it was her duty&mdash;a
      very onerous and disagreeable one, too&mdash;to rescue them from the evil
      influence of demagogues and such like; and that when represented by a
      member of <i>her</i> family, they would be invested with a pledge that
      everything which proper legislation could do for them would be theirs. So
      far she had the approval of her own conscience; and for all that was to
      follow after, she never consulted that tribunal. It is not at all
      improbable that there was little opportunity of doing so in a week of such
      bustle and excitement. Every day brought with it fresh cares and troubles;
      and although Kate Henderson proved herself invaluable in her various
      functions, her Ladyship's fatigues and exertions were of the greatest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after the election Lady Dorothea kept her bed. The second day,
      too, she never made her appearance; and it was late in the afternoon of
      the third that she stole languidly into her library, and ordered her maid
      to send Miss Henderson to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Kate entered the room, she could not help feeling struck by the
      alteration that had taken place in her Ladyship's appearance, who, as she
      lay back in a deep chair, with closed eyes and folded hands, looked like
      one risen from a long sick-bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she started and opened her eyes, however, at Kate's approach, the
      features assumed much of their wonted expression, and their haughty
      character was only tinged, but not subdued, by the look of sorrow they
      wore. With the low and pleasant voice which Kate possessed in perfection,
      she had begun to utter some words of pleasure at seeing her Ladyship
      again, when the other interrupted her hastily, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you to read to me, child. There, take that volume of Madame de
      Sevigne, and begin where you see the mark. You appear weak to-day,&mdash;tired,
      perhaps?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, a mere passing sense of fatigue, my Lady," said Kate, assuming her
      place, and preparing her book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chagrin, annoyance&mdash;disgust I would call it&mdash;are far more
      wearing than mere labor. For my own part, I think nothing of exertion. But
      let us not speak of it. Begin."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Kate now commenced one of those charming letters, wherein the thought
      is so embellished by the grace of expression that there is a perpetual
      semblance of originality, without that strain upon the comprehension that
      real novelty exacts. She read, too, with consummate skill. To all the
      natural gifts of voice and utterance she added a most perfect taste, and
      that nicely subdued dramatic feeling which lends to reading its great
      fascination. Nearly an hour had thus passed, and not a word nor a gesture
      from Lady Dorothea interrupted the reader. With slightly drooped eyelids,
      she sat calm and tranquil; and as Kate, at moments, stole a passing glance
      towards her, she could not guess whether she was listening to her or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd have succeeded on the stage, Miss Henderson," said she at length,
      raising her eyes slowly. "Did it never occur to you to think of that
      career?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once I had some notion of it, my Lady," said Kate quietly. "I played in a
      little private theatre of the Duchess's, and they thought that I had some
      dramatic ability."
    </p>
    <p>
      "People of condition have turned actors, latterly,&mdash;men, of course, I
      mean; for women, the ordeal is too severe,&mdash;the coarse familiarity of
      a very coarse class, the close association with most inferior natures&mdash;By
      the way, what a week of it we have had! I 'd not have believed any one who
      told me that the whole globe contained as much unredeemed vulgarity as
      this little neighborhood. What was the name of the odious little woman
      that always lifted the skirt of her dress before sitting down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Creevy, my Lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure,&mdash;Mrs. Creevy. And her friend, who always came with her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Busk&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, of course; Miss Busk, of the Emporium. If I don't mistake, I 've
      given her an order for something,&mdash;bonnets, or caps; what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A head-dress. Your Ladyship told her&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 'll make me ill, child&mdash;positively ill&mdash;if you remind me of
      such horrors. I told you to come and read for me, and you begin to inflict
      me with what&mdash;I declare solemnly&mdash;is the most humiliating
      incident of my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate resumed her book, and read on. Lady Dorothea was now, however,
      unmistakably inattentive, and the changing color of her cheek betrayed the
      various emotions which moved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really fancy that Miss Martin liked the atrocious creatures we have
      received here the past week; she certainly showed them a species of
      attention quite distinct from mere acceptance; and then they all addressed
      her like old acquaintance. Did you observe that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought that they assumed a degree of familiarity with Miss Martin
      which was scarcely consistent with their station."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say highly ridiculous, child,&mdash;perfectly preposterous; for although
      she will persist in a style of living very opposite to the requirements of
      her position, she is Miss Martin, and <i>my</i> niece!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was now a dead pause of some seconds. At length her Ladyship spoke:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "To have been beaten in one's own town, where we own every stick and stone
      in the place, really requires some explanation; and the more I reflect
      upon it, the more mysterious does it seem. Repton, indeed, had much to say
      to it. He is so indiscreet,&mdash;eh, don't you think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is very vain of his conversational powers, my Lady, and, like all
      clever talkers, says too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so. But I don't think him even agreeable. I deem him a bore," said
      my Lady, snappishly. "That taste for story-telling&mdash;that anecdotic
      habit&mdash;is quite vulgar; nobody does it now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate listened, as though too eager for instruction to dare to lose a word,
      and her Ladyship went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place, everybody&mdash;in society, I mean&mdash;knows every
      story that can or ought to be told; and, secondly, a narrative always
      interrupts conversation, which is a game to be played by several."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate nodded slightly, as though to accord as much acquiescence as
      consorted with great deference.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is possible, therefore," resumed her Ladyship, "that he may have
      divulged many things in that careless way he talked; and my niece, too,
      may have been equally silly. In fact, one thing is clear,&mdash;the enemy
      acquired a full knowledge of our tactics, and met every move we made by
      another. I was prepared for all the violence, all the insult, all the
      licentious impertinence and ribaldry of such a contest; but certainly I
      reckoned on success." Another long and dreary pause ensued, and Lady
      Dorothea's countenance grew sadder and more clouded as she sat in moody
      silence. At length a faint tinge of color marked her cheek; her eyes
      sparkled, and it was in a voice of more than ordinary energy she said: "If
      they fancy, however, that we shall accept defeat with submission, they are
      much mistaken. They have declared the war, and it shall not be for them to
      proclaim peace on the day they 've gained a victory. And Miss Martin also
      must learn that her Universal Benevolence scheme must give way to the
      demands of a just retribution. Have you made out the list I spoke of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my Lady, in part; some details are wanting, but there are eighteen
      cases here quite perfect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These are all cottiers,&mdash;pauper tenants," said Lady Dorothea,
      scanning the paper superciliously through her eyeglass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not all, my Lady; here, for instance, is Dick Sheehan, the blacksmith,
      who has worked for the castle twenty-eight years, and who holds a farm
      called Mulianahogue, on a terminable lease."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he voted against us?" broke she in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; and made a very violent speech, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, turn him out, then," said Lady Dorothea, interrupting her. "Now,
      where 's your father? Send for Henderson at once; I 'll have no delay with
      this matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have sent for him, my Lady; he 'll be here within half an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Scanlan also. We shall want him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Scanlan will be here at the same time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This case here, with two crosses before it, what does this refer to?"
      said her Ladyship, pointing to a part of the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's Mr. Magennis, my Lady, of Barnagheela, who has been making
      incessant appeals for a renewal of his tenure&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how did he behave?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He seconded Mr. Massingbred's nomination, and made a very outrageous
      speech on the occasion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure, I remember him; and he had the insolence&mdash;the
      unparalleled insolence&mdash;afterwards to address Miss Martin, as she sat
      beside me in the carriage, and to tell her that if the rest of the family
      had been like her the scene that had been that day enacted would never
      have occurred! Who is this Hosey Lynch? His name is so familiar to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is a postmaster of Oughterard, and a kind of factotum in the town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then make a note of him. He must be dismissed at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is not a freeholder, my lady, but only mentioned as an active agent of
      the Liberal party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't adopt that vulgar cant, Miss Henderson,&mdash;at least, when
      speaking to <i>me</i>, They are not&mdash;they have no pretensions to be
      called the Liberal party. It is bad taste as well as bad policy to apply a
      flattering epithet to a faction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall I call them in future, my Lady?" asked Kate, with a most
      admirably assumed air of innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call them Papists, Radicals, Insurgents,&mdash;anything, in fact, which
      may designate the vile principles they advocate. You mentioned Mr.
      Nelligan, and I own to you I felt ill&mdash;positively ill&mdash;at the
      sound of his name. Just to think of that man's ingratitude,&mdash;base
      ingratitude. It is but the other day his son was our guest here,&mdash;actually
      dined at the table with us! You were here. <i>You</i> saw him yourself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my Lady," was the quiet reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm sure nothing could be more civil, nothing more polite, than our
      reception of him. I talked to him myself, and asked him something&mdash;I
      forget what&mdash;about his future prospects, and see if this man, or his
      father&mdash;for it matters not which&mdash;is not the ringleader of this
      same movement! I tell you, child, and I really do not say so to hurt your
      feelings, or to aggravate your natural regrets at your condition in life,
      but I say it as a great moral lesson,&mdash;that low people are invariably
      deceitful. Perhaps they do not always intend it; perhaps&mdash;and very
      probably, indeed&mdash;their standard of honorable dealing is a low one;
      but of the fact itself you may rest assured. They are treacherous, and
      they are vindictive!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ennis Cafferty, my Lady, who lives at Broguestown," said Kate, reading
      from the list, "sends a petition to your Ladyship, entreating forgiveness
      if he should have done anything to cause displeasure to the family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What <i>did</i> he do? that is the question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He carried a banner inscribed 'Down with Monopoly!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mark him for eviction. I'll have no half measures. Miss Martin has
      brought the estate to such a pass that we may draw the rents, but never
      aspire to the influence of our property. These people shall now know their
      real masters. Who is that knocking at the door?&mdash;Come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      And at this summons, uttered in a voice not peculiar for suavity, Mr.
      Henderson entered, bowing profoundly, and smoothing the few glossy hairs
      that streaked rather than covered his bald head. A momentary glance passed
      between the father and daughter; so fleeting, however, was it, that the
      most sharp-eyed observer could not have detected its meaning. Lady
      Dorothea was too deeply occupied with her own thoughts to waste a second's
      consideration on either of them, and promptly said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you, Henderson, to inform me who are the chief persons who have
      distinguished themselves in this outrageous insult to us in the borough."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Henderson moved from one foot to the other, once more stroked down his
      hair, and seemed like a man suddenly called upon to enter on a very
      unpleasant and somewhat difficult task.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you don't like the office, sir?" said she, hastily. "Perhaps your
      own principles are opposed to it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Na, my Leddy," said he, deferentially, "I ha' nae principles but such as
      the family sanctions. It's nae business o' mine to profess poleetical
      opinions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true, sir,&mdash;very just; you comprehend your station," replied
      she, proudly. "And now to my demand. Who are the heads of this revolt?&mdash;for
      it is a revolt!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's nae sa much a revolt, my Leddy," rejoined he, slowly and
      respectfully, "as the sure and certain consequence of what has been going
      on for years on the property. I did my best, by warning, and indeed by
      thwarting, so far as I could, these same changes. But I was not listened
      to. I foretold what it would all end in, this amelearating the condition
      of the small farmer&mdash;this raising the moral standard of the people,
      and a' that. I foresaw that if they grew richer they 'd grow sturdier; and
      if they learned to read, they'd begin to reflact. Ah, my leddy, a vara
      dangerous practice this same habit of reflection is, to folk who wear
      ragged clothes and dine on potatoes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I apprehend that the peril is not felt so acutely in your own country,
      sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vara true, my Leddy; your remark is vara just; but there's this
      difference to be remembered: the Scotch are canny folk, and we do many a
      thing that might n't be safe for others, but we take care never to do them
      ower much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want your philosophizing, sir, about national characteristics. I
      conclude that you know&mdash;it is your duty to know&mdash;whence this
      spirit took its rise. I desire to be informed on this head, and also what
      measures you have to advise for its suppression."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another pause, longer and more embarrassing than the first, followed on
      this speech, and Mr. Henderson really seemed balancing within himself
      whether he would or not give evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your reluctance has only to go a step further, Henderson, to impress me
      with the worst suspicions of yourself!" said Lady Dorothea, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm vara sorry for it, my Leddy; I don't deserve them," was the calm
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Lady Dorothea been quick-sighted, she might have detected a glance
      which the daughter directed towards her father; but she had been more than
      quick-minded if she could have read its meaning, so strange was the
      expression it bore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In plain words, sir, do you know the offenders? and if so, how can we
      punish them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Leddyship has them all there," said he, pointing to the list on the
      table; "but there's nae sa much to be done wi' them, as the chief o' the
      lot are men o' mark and means, wi' plenty o' siller, and the sperit to
      spend it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear of nothing but defaulters till a moment like this arrives, sir,"
      said her Ladyship, passionately. "The burden of every song is arrears of
      rent; and now I am told that the tenantry are so prosperous that they can
      afford to defy their landlord. Explain this, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Mr. Henderson had completed that hesitating process which with him
      was the prelude to an answer, the door opened, and Mary Martin entered.
      She was in a riding-dress, and bore the traces of the road on her splashed
      costume; but her features were paler than usual, and her lip quivered as
      she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear aunt," cried she, not seeming to notice that others were present,
      "I have come back at speed from Kyle's Wood to learn if it be true&mdash;but
      it cannot be true&mdash;however the poor creatures there believe it&mdash;that
      they are to be discharged from work, and no more employment given at the
      quarries. You have n't seen them, dear aunt&mdash;you haven't beheld them,
      as I did this morning&mdash;standing panic-stricken around the scene of
      their once labor, not speaking, scarcely looking at each other, more like
      a shipwrecked crew upon an unknown shore than fathers and mothers beside
      their own homesteads!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was I gave the order, Miss Martin," said Lady Dorothea, proudly. "If
      these people prefer political agitation to an honest subsistence, let them
      pay the price of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who says that they have done so?" replied Mary. "These poor creatures
      have not a single privilege to exercise; they have n't a vote amongst
      them. The laws have forgotten them just as completely as human charity
      has."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If they have no votes to record, they have voices to outrage and insult
      their natural protectors. Henderson knows that the worst mobs in the
      borough were from this very district."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him give the names of those he alludes to. Let him tell me ten&mdash;five&mdash;ay,
      three, if he can, of Kyle's Wood men who took any share in the
      disturbances. I am well aware that it is a locality where he enjoys little
      popularity himself; but at least he need not calumniate its people. Come,
      sir, who are these you speak of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate Henderson, who sat with bent-down head during this speech, contrived
      to steal a glance at the speaker so meaningful and so supplicating that
      Mary faltered, and as a deep blush covered her cheek, she hastily added:
      "But this is really not the question. This miserable contest has done us
      all harm; but let us not perpetuate its bitterness! We have been beaten in
      an election, but I don't think we ought to be worsted in a struggle of
      generosity and good feeling. Come over, dear aunt, and see these poor
      creatures."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall certainly do no such thing, Miss Martin. In the first place, the
      fever never leaves that village."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true, aunt; and it will be worse company if our kindness should
      desert them. But if you will not come, take <i>my</i> word for the state
      of their destitution. We have nothing so poor on the whole estate."
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0012" id="linkimage-0012">

      <img src="images/330.jpg" width="100%" alt="330 " />
    </div>
    <p>
      "It is but a moment back I was told that the spirit of resistance to our
      influence here arose from the wealthy independence of the people; now, I
      am informed it is their want and destitution suggest the opposition. I
      wish I could ascertain which of you is right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's little matter if our theory does not lead us to injustice," said
      Mary, boldly. "Let me only ride back to the quarries, aunt, and tell these
      poor people that they 've nothing to fear,&mdash;that there is no thought
      of withdrawing from them their labor nor its hire. Their lives are, God
      knows, not overlaid with worldly blessings; let us not add one drop that
      we can spare to their cup of sorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The young leddy says na mair than the fact; they're vara poor, and they
      're vara dangerous!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you mean dangerous, sir?" asked Lady Dorothea, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's more out o' that barony at the assizes, my Leddy, than from any
      other on the property."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Starvation and crime are near relatives all the world over," said Mary;
      "nor do I see that the way to cure the one is to increase the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then let us get rid of both," said Lady Dorothea. "I don't see why we are
      to nurse pauperism either into fever or rebellion. To feed people that
      they may live to infect you, or, perhaps, shoot you, is sorry policy. You
      showed me a plan for getting rid of them, Henderson,&mdash;something about
      throwing down their filthy hovels, or unroofing them, or something of that
      kind, and then they were to emigrate&mdash;I forget where&mdash;to
      America, I believe&mdash;and become excellent people, hard-working and
      quiet. I know it all sounded plausible and nice; tell Miss Martin your
      scheme, and if it does not fulfil all you calculated, it will at least
      serve for an example on the estate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An example!" cried Mary. "Take care, my Lady. It's a dangerous precept
      you are about to inculcate, and admits of a terrible imitation!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you have decided me, Miss Martin," said Lady Dorothea, haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, good Heavens! is it for a rash word of mine&mdash;for a burst of
      temper that I could not control&mdash;you will turn out upon the wide
      world a whole village,&mdash;the old that have grown gray there,&mdash;the
      infant that clings to its mother in her misery, and makes a home for her
      by its very dependence&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every one of them, sir," said Lady Dorothea, addressing herself to
      Henderson, who had asked some question in a low whisper. "They 're
      cottiers all; they require no delays of law, and I insist upon it
      peremptorily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not till my uncle hears of it!" exclaimed Mary, passionately. "A cruel
      wrong like this shall not be done in mad haste." And with these words,
      uttered in all the vehemence of great excitement, she rushed from the room
      in search of Martin.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. A CHARACTERISTIC LETTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      It may save the reader some time, and relieve him from the weary task of
      twice listening to the same story, if we steal some passages from a letter
      which, about this time, Jack Massingbred addressed to his former
      correspondent. He wrote from the inn at Oughterard, and, although still
      under the influence of the excitement of the late contest, expressed
      himself with much of his constitutional calm and frankness. We shall not
      recapitulate his narrative of the election, but proceed at once to what
      followed on that description.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see, Harry, the dubious projection of your nether lip, I appreciate the
      slow nod of your head, and I fancy I can hear the little half-sigh of
      deprecation with which you hear all this. Worse again, I don't seek to
      defend myself. I think my case a bad one; but still I feel there is
      something to be said in mitigation. You need not trouble yourself to draw
      up an indictment: I plead guilty&mdash;entirely guilty&mdash;to all you
      can say. I <i>have</i> broken with 'the gentlemen' to cast my lot with the
      <i>canaille</i>. Why have n't we a good wholesome word of our own for a
      home-made article? I <i>have</i> deserted the ranks where, whatever
      fortune befell, it was honor to fight; I have given up association with
      the well-bred and the well-mannered, to rub shoulders with the
      coarse-minded, the rough-hearted, and the vulgar. There is not a reproach
      you can make me on this score that I have n't already addressed to myself.
      I feel all the indignity of my situation,&mdash;I experience all the
      insult of their companionship; but, as the lady detected in possession of
      her lover's picture pleaded in her defence that it was not like him, so I
      hope to arrest judgment against me by the honest avowal that I detest and
      despise my party. I don't talk to <i>you</i> about their principles&mdash;still
      less do I say anything of my own&mdash;but merely advert here to the
      miserable compromise a gentleman is driven to make with every sentiment of
      his nature who once enlists under their flag. As Travers told us one
      evening&mdash;you were of the party, and must remember it&mdash;he was
      speaking of the Peninsular campaign, in which he served as a volunteer&mdash;'So
      long as you were fighting,' said he, 'it was all very well; the fellows
      were stout-hearted and full of spirit, and you felt that you couldn't ask
      for better comrades; but when the struggle was over&mdash;when it came to
      associating, living with them, hearing their sentiments, sharing their
      opinions, hopes, fears, wishes, and so on&mdash;then it became downright
      degradation!' Not, as he remarked, that they were one jot more vicious or
      more corrupt than their betters, but that every vice and every corruption
      amongst them seemed doubly offensive by the contact with their coarse
      natures. Now, my friends, the Liberals, are somewhat in the same category.
      They do their work right well on the field of battle; they fight, swear,
      slander, and perjure themselves just like gentlemen; or rather better of
      the two. They even come down handsomely with their cash,&mdash;the last
      best evidence any man can tender of his honesty in a cause; but then,
      Harry, the struggle over, it is sorry work to become their companion and
      their friend! Oh! if you had but seen the dinners I have eaten, and the
      women I have handed down to them!&mdash;if you could have but heard the
      sentiments I have cheered,&mdash;ay, and even uttered,&mdash;only listened
      to the projects we have discussed, and the plans matured as we sat over
      our whiskey-punch,&mdash;you 'd say, 'Jack must have the ambition of the
      Evil One himself in his heart, since he pays this price for the mere
      glimpse of the goal before him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Throughout the whole of your last letter I can detect a sense of
      apprehension lest, 'with all my tact,' as you phrase it, these people are
      not really duping we,&mdash;using me for a present purpose, with the
      foregone resolve to get rid of me when it be accomplished. To be sure they
      are, Harry. I never doubted it for a moment. The only question is, which
      of us shall trip up the other! They desire to show the world that the
      operation of the Relief Bill will not be of that exclusive character its
      opponents proclaimed,&mdash;that a Catholic constituency would choose a
      Protestant,&mdash;even prefer one,&mdash;as Mr. O'Connell said. The
      opportunity was a good one to display this sentiment, and so they took me!
      Now, <i>my</i> notion is, that every great measure can have only one real
      importance, by throwing weight into the scale of one or other of the two
      great Parliamentary parties. Do what you will,&mdash;agitate, write,
      speak, pamphleteer, and libel,&mdash;but all resolves itself to some
      question of a harm to one side and good to the other, the country the
      while being wonderfully little the better or the worse for all the
      legislation. We used to have a Constitution in England: we have now only
      got a Parliament, and to be anything in the nation a man must make himself
      felt there! This, 'if I have the stuff in me,' as old Sherry said, I mean
      to do&mdash;<i>et nous verrons!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fatigues of this new life are very great. I 'm up before it is well
      day, writing and revising newspaper articles, answering letters, and
      replying to 'queries.' I have my whole mornings taken up in audiences of
      my constituents, swallowing pledges, and recording promises; and later on
      I go to dinner, 'with what appetite I may,' to some one of my faithful
      supporters,&mdash;some corn-chandler who spouts 'foreign politics,' or a
      grocer who ought to be Colonial Secretary! But still I 'm thankful for all
      this bustle and occupation: it averts reflection, it raises a barrier
      against thought, and muffles the clapper of that small hand-bell in the
      human heart men call their conscience! They say few men would have courage
      for either a battle or a wedding if it were not for the din of the
      trumpets and the joy-bells; and I'm convinced that noise&mdash;mere noise&mdash;has
      no small share in determining the actions of mankind!
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, Harry, for a confession. I 'm heartily sorry for the whole of
      this business, and were it to be done again, nothing would tempt me to
      play the same part in it. I was leading the jolliest life imaginable at
      Cro' Martin. I had made the place and the people my own. It was a kind of
      existence that suited me,&mdash;sufficient of occupation, and enough of
      leisure. There were oddities to laugh at, eccentricities to quiz, an old
      lawyer to sharpen one's wits upon, and a governess&mdash;such a governess&mdash;to
      flirt with! Don't mistake me, Harry; it was not one of those
      hand-pressing, downcast-gazing, low-speaking cases in which you are such a
      proficient. It was far more like the approaches one might be supposed to
      make to a young tigress in a cage,&mdash;a creature with whom a mistake
      would be your ruin, and whom you always caressed with a sense of impending
      peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told you how ably she aided me in this contest,&mdash;how she labored
      to obtain information&mdash;secret information&mdash;for me as to every
      voter in the borough. What prompted her to this course I cannot fathom.
      She does not appear to bear any grudge against the Martins,&mdash;she had
      been but a few weeks amongst them,&mdash;and is, all things considered,
      well treated and well received. As little was it any special favor towards
      myself. Indeed, on that head she will not permit me to fall into any
      error. I cannot suppose that with her foreign education and foreign habits
      she cares a jot for the small schemes and intriguings of home politics,&mdash;so
      what can it possibly mean? Help me to the solution of this riddle, and I
      'll be more deeply your debtor than I can well say. Brought up as she has
      been,&mdash;and as I have told you in my last letter,&mdash;nothing would
      be more natural than her adoption of every prejudice of the class by whom
      she has been so singularly distinguished; and in this light I have always
      viewed her. Under the calm reserve of a most polished manner you can still
      detect a shrinking horror of all the vulgar association of the rank she
      came from. Her quiet deference, haughtier by far than the domination of
      those above her; the humility that no flatteries ever breached; a
      self-possession that never seemed so strong as when resisting the
      blandishments of praise,&mdash;these are strange gifts in a young girl
      with beauty enough to turn half the heads of half the fools we know of,
      and more than enough to make crazy that of him who writes this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tried twenty things to resist this tendency on my part. I laughed at
      myself for the absurdity it would lead to. I ridiculed to my own heart all
      the extravagance of such a project. I even wrote a paragraph for the
      'Times' announcing the marriage of Jack Massingbred with Kate Henderson,
      the only daughter of Paul Henderson, the Land Steward, and pasted it above
      my chimney to shock and outrage me. I did more. I made love to Miss Martin&mdash;as
      an alterative, as the doctors would call it&mdash;but I fell at a stone
      wall, got laughed at, and cured of my passion; and, lastly, I climbed that
      lofty tree of my family, and sat high among the branches of defunct barons
      and baronets, to get a bird's-eye view of the small mushrooms that grow on
      the earth beneath, but hang me, Harry, if the agarics did n't seem better
      company, and I was glad to get down amongst them again, meaning thereby to
      sit beside that one dear specimen of the class I allude to!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see that you are curious to know how all these late events have
      modified my relations with my father, and really I cannot answer your
      inquiry. It is more than likely that my obtaining a seat in Parliament
      will embarrass rather than serve him with his party, since he will be
      expected to control a vote over which he can exert no influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As yet, nothing has occurred to draw us any closer, and my only
      communications to him have been certain recommendatory letters, which my
      constituents here have somewhat peremptorily demanded at my hands. I gave
      them freely, for, after all, application is an easier task than refusing,
      and besides, Harry, it is very difficult to persuade your election friends
      that you cannot be a patriot and a patron at the same time, and that, in
      the luxurious pastime of badgering a government, a man surrenders some of
      the pretensions to place. I gave them, therefore, all the letters they
      asked for; and if the Chief Secretary but answer one half of my appeals,
      Galway&mdash;or at least that small portion of it called Oughter-ard&mdash;will
      have no cause of complaint on the score of its claims to office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are, I perceive, astonished that I continue to remain here. So am I,
      Harry. The place is detestable in almost every way. I am beset with
      entreaties, persecuted with vulgar attentions, bored to death by the
      insolent familiarity of people I cannot&mdash;do all that I will&mdash;grow
      intimate with; and yet I stay on, pretexting this, that, and t' other to
      myself, and shrinking even to my own heart to avow the real reason of my
      delay!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want once again, if only for a few moments, to see her. I want to try
      if by any ingenuity I could discover the mystery of her conduct with
      regard to myself; and I want also, if there should be the need to do so,
      to justify to her eyes many things which I have been forced by
      circumstances to do in this contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not the slightest suspicion as to how she views all that has
      occurred here. Two notes which I addressed to her, very respectful,
      businesslike epistles, have not been answered, though I entreated for a
      few words to acknowledge their receipt. The Martins, since the election,
      seem to have quarantined the whole town and neighborhood. They suffer none
      of their people to enter here. They have sent eight miles further off to
      market, and even changed the post-town for their letters. Their policy is,
      so far, shortsighted, as it has called into an exaggerated importance all
      that small fry&mdash;like the Nelligans&mdash;who have hitherto been
      crushed under the greater wealth of the rich proprietor. But I am again
      drifting into that tiresome tideway of politics which I have sworn to
      myself to avoid, if only for a few days; in pursuance of which wise
      resolve I shall betake myself to the mountains, under the pretext of
      shooting. A gun is an idler's passport, and a game-bag and a shot-pouch
      are sufficient to throw a dignity over vagabondism. You will therefore
      divine that I am not bent on snipe slaughter, but simply a good excuse to
      be alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean to go to-morrow, and shall first turn my steps towards the coast,
      which, so far as I have seen, is singularly bold and picturesque. If
      nothing occurs to alter my determination, I 'll leave this unclosed till I
      can tell you that I have come back here, which in all probability will be
      by the end of the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once more here, my dear Harry, I sit down to add a few lines to this
      already over-lengthy epistle. Wishing to give you some notion of the
      scenery, I set out with all the appliances of a sketcher, and have really
      contrived to jot down some spots which, for general wildness and grandeur,
      it would be difficult to surpass within the bounds of our country. Nor is
      it alone the forms that are so striking, although I could show you
      outlines here perfectly Alpine in their fantastic extravagance; but the
      colors are finer than anything I have seen north of the Alps,&mdash;heaths
      and lichens grouped over rugged masses of rock, with shades of purple and
      gold such as no diadem ever equalled. The sunsets, too, were gorgeous! You
      remember how struck we both were at the moment when the dome and aisle of
      St. Peter's burst into light, and from the darkness of midnight every
      column and every statue became illuminated in a second; but a thousand
      times beyond this in grandeur of effect was the moment of the sun's
      decline below the horizon. The instant before, the great sullen sea was
      rolling and heaving with its leaden blue surface, slightly traced here and
      there with foam, but no sooner had the sun touched the horizon, than a
      flood of purple glory spread over the whole ocean, so that it became like
      a sea of molten gold and amber. The dark cliffs and rugged crags, the
      wave-beaten rocks, and the rude wild islands, darksome and dismal but a
      moment back, were now all glittering and glowing, every pinnacle and every
      peak in deep carbuncle red. How suggestive to him who would describe an
      enchanted land or region of magic splendor! and what a hint for your
      scene-painter, who, with all his devices of Bengal and blue light, with
      every trick that chemistry and optics could aid in, never fancied anything
      so splendid or so gorgeous.
    </p>

      "I have half filled a sketch-book for you, and more than half filled my
      game-bag with mosses and ferns, and such-like gear, which, knowing your
      weakness, I have gathered, but, not understanding their virtues, may, for
      aught I know, be the commonest things in creation. I can only vouch for
      their being very beautiful, and very unlike anything else I ever saw
      before; fragments of marble, too, and specimens of Irish jasper and onyx,
      are amidst my rubbish, or my treasures, whichever you shall pronounce them
      to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I got through&mdash;don't fancy that the phrase denotes weariness or <i>ennui</i>&mdash;I
      got through four days in these pursuits, and then I took boat, and for
      three more I paddled about the coast, dipping in amongst the cliffs and
      creeks and caves of this wonderful coast, gathering shells and seaweed,
      and shooting curlews and eating lobsters, and, in fact, to all intents and
      purposes, suffering a 'sea change' over myself and my spirit as
      unearthlike as well may be imagined; and at last I bethought me of my new
      openiug career, and all that I ought to be doing in preparation of St.
      Stephen's, and so I turned my steps landward and towards 'my borough.' I
      like to say 'my borough;' it sounds feudal and insolent and old Torylike;
      it smacks of the day when people received their representative thankfully,
      as an alms, and your great proprietor created his nominee as the consul
      ennobled his horse!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Revolving very high thoughts, reciting Edmund Burke's grandest
      perorations, and picturing very vividly before me the stunning triumphs of
      my own eloquence in the House, I plodded along, this time at least
      wonderfully indifferent to the scenery, and totally oblivious of where I
      was, when suddenly I perceived the great trees of Cro' Martin demesne
      shadowing the road I travelled, and saw that I was actually within a mile
      or so of the Castle! You, Harry, have contrived, some way or other, to
      have had a very rose-colored existence. I never heard that you had been
      jilted by a mistress, 'cut' by a once friend, or coldly received by the
      rich relative from whom you derived all your expectations. I am not even
      aware that the horse you backed ever went wrong, or that the bill you
      endorsed for another ever came back protested. In fact, you are what the
      world loves best, cherishes most, and lavishes all its blandishments on,&mdash;a
      devilish lucky fellow! Lucky in a capital fortune, abundance of good
      gifts, good looks, and an iron constitution,&mdash;one of those natures
      that can defy duns, blue-devils, and dyspepsia! Being, therefore, all
      this, well received everywhere, good company where pheasants are to be
      shot, Burgundy to be drunk, or young ladies to be married,&mdash;for you
      are a good shot, a good wine-taster, and a good <i>parti</i>,&mdash;with
      such gifts, I say, it will be very difficult to evoke your sympathy on the
      score of a misfortune which no effort of your imagination could compass.
      In fact, to ask you to feel what I did, as I found myself walking along <i>outside</i>
      of those grounds <i>within</i> which, but a few days back, I was the
      cherished visitor, and in sight of that smoke which denoted a hearth
      beside which I was never to sit again, and from which I was banished with
      something not very unlike disgrace! No sophistry I could summon was
      sufficient to assuage the poignancy of this sentiment. I feel certain that
      I could stand any amount of open public abuse, any known or unknown
      quantity of what is genteelly called 'slanging,' but I own to you that the
      bare thought of how my name might at that moment be mentioned beneath that
      roof, or even the very reserve that saved it from mention, caused me
      unutterable bitterness, and it was in a state of deep humiliation of
      spirit that I took the very first path that led across the fields and away
      from Cro' Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They tell me that a light heart makes easy work of a day's journey. Take
      my word for it, that to get over the ground without a thought of the road,
      there's nothing like a regular knock-down affliction. I walked eight
      hours, and at a good pace, too, without so much as a few minutes' halt, so
      overwhelmed was I with sensations that would not admit of my remembering
      anything else. My first moment of consciousness&mdash;for really it was
      such&mdash;came on as I found myself breasting a steep stony ascent, on
      the brow of which stood the bleak residence of my friend Mr. Magennis, of
      Barnagheela. I have already told you of my visit to his house, so that I
      need not inflict you with any new detail of the locality, but I confess,
      little as it promised to cheer or rally the spirits, I was well pleased to
      find myself so near a roof under which I might take refuge. I knocked
      vigorously at the door, but none answered my summons. I repeated my demand
      for admittance still more loudly, and at last went round to the back of
      the house, which I found as rigidly barred as the front. While still
      hesitating what course to take, I spied Joan Landy&mdash;you remember the
      girl I spoke of in a former letter&mdash;ascending the hill at a brisk
      pace. In a moment I was beside her. Poor thing, she seemed overjoyed at
      our meeting, and warmly welcomed me to her house. 'Tom is away,' said she,
      'in Dublin, they tell me, but he 'll be back in a day or two, and there 's
      nobody he 'd be so glad to see as yourself when he comes.' In the world,
      Harry,&mdash;that is, in your world and mine,&mdash;such a proposition as
      Joan's would have its share of embarrassments. Construe it how one might,
      there would be at least some awkwardness in accepting such hospitality. So
      I certainly felt it, and, as we walked along, rather turned the
      conversation towards herself, and whither she had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I 'm not more than half an hour out of the house,' said she, 'for I only
      went down the boreen to show the short cut by Kell Mills to a young lady
      that was here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'A visitor, Mrs. Joan?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yes. But to be sure you know her yourself, for you came with her the day
      she walked part of the way back with me from Cro' Martin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Miss Henderson?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Maybe that's her name. She only told me to call her Kate.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Was she here alone?&mdash;did she come on foot?&mdash;which way is she
      gone?' cried I, hurrying question after question. Perhaps the tone of my
      last was most urgent, for it was to that she replied, by pointing to a
      glen between two furze-clad hills, and saying, 'That's the road she 's
      taking, till she crosses the ford at Coomavaragh.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'And she is alone?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That she is; sorra a one with her, and she has five good miles before
      her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never waited for more. If I did say good-bye to poor Joan, I really
      forget; but I dashed down the mountain at speed, and hurried onward in the
      direction she had pointed out. In an instant all my fatigue of the day was
      forgotten, and as I went along I remembered nothing, thought of nothing,
      but the object of my pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You who have so often bantered me on the score of my languor&mdash;that
      'elegant lassitude,' as you used to call it, which no zeal ever warmed,
      nor any ardor ever could excite&mdash;would have been somewhat astonished
      had you seen the reckless, headlong pace at which I went,&mdash;vaulting
      over gates, clearing fences, and dashing through swamps, without ever a
      moment's hesitation. Picture to yourself, then, my splashed and heated
      condition as, after a two-miles' chase in this fashion, I at length
      overtook her, just as she was in search of a safe spot to ford the river.
      Startled by the noise behind her, she turned suddenly round, and in an
      instant we stood face to face. I 'd have given much to have seen some show
      of confusion, even embarrassment in her looks, but there was not the
      slightest. No, Harry, had we met in a drawing-room, her manner could not
      have been more composed, as she said,&mdash;'Good-morning, Mr.
      Massingbred. Have you had much sport?' 'My chase was after <i>you</i>,
      Miss Henderson,' said I, hurriedly. 'I just reached Barnagheela as
      Mistress Joan returned, and having learned which road you took, followed
      you in all haste.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Indeed!' exclaimed she, and in a voice wherein there were blended a vast
      variety of meanings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yes,' I resumed, 'for an opportunity of meeting you alone&mdash;of
      speaking with you even for a few moments&mdash;I have delayed my departure
      this week back. I wrote to you twice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yes; I got your letters.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But did not deign to answer them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "' I did not write to you, because, situated as <i>I</i> was, and regarded
      as <i>you</i> were at Cro' Martin, there would have been a species of
      treason in maintaining anything like correspondence, just as I feel there
      is somewhat akin to it in our intercourse at this moment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'And have the events occurring lately changed <i>your</i> feeling with
      regard to me?' asked I, half reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I don't exactly know to what former condition you refer, Mr.
      Massingbred,' said she, calmly. 'If to the counsels which you were
      gracious enough to receive at hands humble and inexperienced as mine, they
      were given, as you remember, when you were the chosen representative of
      the family at Cro' Martin, and continued only so long as you remained
      such.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Then I have deceived myself, Miss Henderson,' broke I in. 'I had fancied
      that there was a personal good-will in the aid you tendered me. I even
      flattered myself that I owed my success entirely and solely to your
      efforts.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You are jesting, Mr. Massingbred,' said she, with a saucy smile; 'no one
      better than yourself knows how to rely upon his own abilities.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'At least, confess that it was you who first suggested to me that they
      were worth cultivating; that it was <i>you</i> who pointed out a road to
      me in life, and even promised me your friendship as the price of my
      worthily adopting it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I remember the conversation you allude to. It was on this very road it
      occurred.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, and have I done anything as yet to forfeit the reward you spoke
      of?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'All this is beside the real question, Mr. Massingbred,' said she,
      hurriedly. 'What you are really curious to learn is, why it is that I,
      being such as I am, should have displayed so much zeal in a cause which
      could not but have been opposed to the interests of those who are my
      patrons. That you have not divined the reason is a proof to me that I
      could not make you understand it. I don't want to talk riddles,&mdash;enough
      that I say it was a caprice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'And yet you talked seriously, persuasively to me, of my future road in
      life; you made me think that you saw in me the qualities that win
      success.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You have a wonderful memory for trifles, sir, since you can recall so
      readily what I said to you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But it was not a trifle to me,' said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Perhaps not, Mr. Massingbred, since it referred to yourself. I don't
      mean this for impertinence!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I am glad that you say so!' cried I, eagerly. 'I am but too happy to
      catch at anything which may tend to convince me that you would not
      willingly hurt my feelings.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "For several minutes neither of us uttered a word; at last I said, 'Should
      I be asking too much, if I begged Miss Henderson to tell me whether she is
      dissatisfied with anything I may have done in this contest? There may be
      matters in which I have been misrepresented; others of which I could make
      some explanation.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Are you quite satisfied with it yourself, sir?' said she, interrupting
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No,' said I; 'so little am I so, that were it all to do over again, I 'd
      not embark in it. The whole affair, from beginning to end, is a false
      position.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ignoble associates&mdash;low companionships&mdash;very underbred
      acquaintances,' said she, in a tone of scorn that seemed far more directed
      at <i>me</i> than the others. I believe I showed how I felt it. I know
      that my cheek was on fire for some seconds after.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The Martins, I take it, are outrageous with me?' said I, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'They never speak of you!' was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Not my Lady?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Nor even Repton?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Not once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That, at least, is more dignified; and if any accident should bring us
      together in county business&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which is not likely.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'How so?' asked I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'They are going away soon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Going away&mdash;to leave Cro' Martin&mdash;and for any time?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'My Lady speaks of the Continent, and that, of course, implies a long
      absence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'And has this miserable election squabble led to this resolve? Is the
      neighborhood to be deprived of its chief ornament&mdash;the people of
      their best friend&mdash;just for the sake of a petty party triumph?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It is fortunate Mr. Massingbred's constituents cannot hear him,' said
      she, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But be serious, and tell me how far am I the cause of all this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The whole cause of it,&mdash;at least, so far as present events can
      reveal.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'How they must abhor me!' said I, half involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'<i>Avec les circonstances atténuantes</i>,' said she, smiling again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'How so?&mdash;what do you mean?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Why, that my Lady is thankful at heart for a good excuse to get away,&mdash;such
      a pretext as Mr. Martin himself cannot oppose. Repton, the Grand Vizier,
      counsels economy, and, like all untravelled people, fancies France and
      Italy cheap to live in; and Miss Mary is, perhaps, not sorry with the
      prospect of the uncontrolled management of the whole estate.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'And is she to live here alone?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yes; she is to be sole mistress of Cro' Martin, and without even a
      governess, since Miss Henderson is to accompany her Ladyship as private
      secretary, minister of the household, and, in fact, any other capacity you
      may please in flattery to assign her. And now, Mr. Massingbred, that I
      have, not over-discreetly, perhaps, adventured to talk of family
      arrangements to a stranger, will you frankly ac-knowledge that your pride,
      or self-love, or any other quality of the same nature, is rather gratified
      than otherwise at all the disturbance you have caused here? Don't you
      really feel pleased to think that you have revolutionized a little
      neighborhood, broken up a society, severed the ties that bound proprietor
      and peasant, and, in fact, made a very pretty chaos, out of which may come
      anything or everything?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'When you address such a question as this to me, you don't expect an
      answer. Indeed, the query itself is its own reply,' said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well said, sir, and with consummate temper, too. Certainly, Mr.
      Massingbred, you possess one great element of success in public life.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which is&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'To bear with equanimity and cool forbearance the impertinences of those
      you feel to be your inferiors.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But it is not in this light I regard Miss Henderson, be assured,' said
      I, with earnestness; 'and if I have not replied to her taunts, it is not
      because I have not felt them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I detected a very faint flush on her cheek as I said this, and
      certainly her features assumed a more serious expression than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Will you let me speak to you of what is far nearer my heart?' said I, in
      a low voice,&mdash;'far nearer than all this strife and war of politics?
      And will you deign to believe that what I say is prompted by whatever I
      know in myself of good or hopeful?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Say on,&mdash;that is, if I ought to hear it,' said she, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Deterred a second or two by her manner, I rallied quickly, and with an
      ardor of which I cannot convey an impression, much less explain,&mdash;one
      of those moments of rhapsody, <i>you 'd</i> call it,&mdash;poured forth a
      warm declaration of love. Aye, Harry, sincere, devoted love!&mdash;a
      passion which, in mastering all the common promptings of mere worldly
      advantage and self-interest, had really inspired me with noble thoughts
      and high aspirations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A judge never listened to a pleading with more dignified patience than
      she did to my appeal. She even waited when I had concluded, as it were to
      allow of my continuing, had I been so minded; when, seeing that I had
      closed my argument, she quietly turned about, and facing the road we had
      just been travelling, pointed to the bleak, bare mountain on which
      Barnagheela stood. 'It was yonder, then, that you caught up this lesson,
      sir. The admirable success of Mr. Magennis's experiment has seduced you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Good heavens! Kate,' cried I&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Sir,' said she, drawing herself proudly up, 'you are continuing the
      parallel too far.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But Miss Henderson cannot for a moment believe&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I can believe a great deal, sir, of what even Mr. Massingbred would
      class with the incredible; but, sir, there are certain situations in life
      which exact deference, from the very fact of their humility. Mine is one
      of these, and I am aware of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Will you not understand me aright?' cried I, eagerly. 'In offering to
      share my fortune in life with you&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Pray, sir, let this stop here. Poor Joan, I have no doubt, felt all the
      grandeur of <i>her</i> elevation, and was grateful even in her misery. But
      <i>I</i> should not do so. I am one of those who think that the cruellest
      share in a <i>mésalliance</i> is that of the humbler victim. To brave such
      a fate, there should be all the hopeful, sanguine sense of strong
      affection; and, as a reserve to fall back on in reverses, there should be
      an intense conviction of the superiority over others of him from whom we
      accept our inferiority. Now, in my case, these two conditions are wanting.
      I know you like frankness, and I am frank.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Even to cruelty,' said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'We are very near Cro' Martin, sir, and I think we ought to part,' said
      she, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'And is it thus you would have us separate? Have I nothing to hope from
      time,&mdash;from the changes that may come over your opinions of me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Calculate rather on the alterations in your own sentiments, Mr.
      Massingbred; and perhaps the day is not very distant when you will laugh
      heartily at yourself for the folly of this same morning,&mdash;a folly
      which might have cost you dearly, sir, for I might have said, Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Would that you had!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Good-bye, sir,' said she, not noticing my interruption, 'and remember
      that, if I should ever need it, I have a strong claim on your gratitude.
      Good-bye!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "She did not give me her hand at parting, but waved it coldly towards me
      as she went. And so she passed the little wicket, and entered the dark
      woods of the demesne, leaving me in a state wherein the sense of
      bewilderment alone prevailed over all else.

      "I have given you this narrative, Harry, as nearly as I can remember,
      every step of it; but I do not ask you to understand it better than I do,
      which means, not at all! Nor will I worry you with the thousand-and-one
      attempts I have made to explain to myself what I still confess to be
      inexplicable. I mean to leave this at once. Would that I had never come
      here! Write to me soon; but no bantering, Harry. Not even my friendship
      for <i>you</i>&mdash;oldest and best of all my friends&mdash;could stand
      any levity on this theme. This girl knows me thoroughly, since she
      comprehends that there is no so certain way to engage my affections as to
      defy them!

      "Write to me, I entreat. Address me at my father's, where I shall be,
      probably, within a week. Were I to read over what I have just written, the

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. THREE COACHES AND THEIR COMPANY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three large and stately travelling-carriages, heavily laden, and
      surrounded with all the appliances for comfort possible, rolled from under
      the arched gateway of Cro' Martin. One eager and anxious face turned
      hastily to catch a last look at the place he was leaving, and then as
      hastily concealing his emotion with his handkerchief, Mr. Martin sat back
      in the carriage in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty minutes after eight!" exclaimed Lady Dorothea, looking at her
      watch. "It is always the case; one never can get away in time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rousted by the speech, Martin started, and turned again to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How handsome those larches are!" cried he; "it seems but yesterday that I
      planted them, and they are magnificent trees now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her Ladyship made no reply, and he went on, half as though speaking to
      himself: "The place is in great beauty just now. I don't think I ever saw
      it looking so well. Shall I ever see it again?" muttered he, in a still
      lower tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really cannot think it ought to break your heart, Mr. Martin, if I were
      to say 'No' to that question," said she, testily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;no!" exclaimed he, repeating the word after her; "not come back
      here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing to prevent us if we should feel disposed to do so,"
      replied she, calmly. "I only observed that one could face the alternative
      with a good courage. The twenty years we have passed in this spot are
      represented to <i>your</i> mind by more leafy trees and better timber. To
      <i>me</i> they are written in the dreary memory of a joyless, weary
      existence. I detest the place," cried she, passionately, "and for nothing
      more, that even on leaving it my spirits are too jaded and broken to feel
      the happiness that they ought."
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin sighed heavily, but did not utter a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is," resumed she; "one ever takes these resolutions too late. What
      we are doing now should have been done sixteen or eighteen years ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or not at all," muttered Martin, but in a voice not meant to be
      overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think so, sir," cried she, catching up his words; "if only as our
      protest against the insolence and ingratitude of this neighborhood,&mdash;of
      these creatures who have actually been maintained by us! It was high time
      to show them their real condition, and to what they will be reduced when
      the influence of our position is withdrawn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it were only for <i>that</i> we are going away&mdash;" And he stopped
      himself as he got thus far.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In itself a good and sufficient reason, sir; but I trust there are others
      also. I should hope that we have paid our debt to patriotism, and that a
      family who have endured twenty years of banishment may return, if only to
      take a passing glance at the world of civilization and refinement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And poor Mary!" exclaimed Martin, with deep feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your niece might have come with us if she pleased, Mr. Martin. To remain
      here was entirely her own choice; not that I am at all disposed to think
      that her resolution was not a wise one. Miss Mary Martin feels very
      naturally her utter deficiency in all the graces and accomplishments which
      should pertain to her condition. She appreciates her unfitness for
      society, and selects&mdash;as I think, with commendable discretion&mdash;a
      sphere much better adapted to her habits."
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin again sighed heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To leave any other girl under such circumstances would have been highly
      improper," resumed her Ladyship; "but she is really suited to this kind of
      life, and perfectly unfit for any other, and I have no doubt she and Catty
      Broon will be excellent company for each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Catty loves her with all her heart," muttered Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      And her Ladyship's lip curled in silent derision at the thought of such
      affection. "And, after all," said he, half involuntarily, "our absence
      will be less felt so long as Molly stays behind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you mean by that, Mr. Martin, that the same system of wasteful
      expenditure is still to continue,&mdash;this universal employment scheme,&mdash;I
      can only say I distinctly and flatly declare against it. Even Rep ton&mdash;and
      I 'm sure he 's no ally of mine&mdash;agrees with me in pronouncing it
      perfectly ruinous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no doubt of the cost of it," said Martin, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir, and what other consideration should weigh with us?&mdash;I
      mean," added she, hastily, "what should have the same weight? The
      immaculate authority I have just quoted has limited our personal
      expenditure for next year to five thousand pounds, and threatens us with
      even less in future if the establishment at Cro' Martin cannot be reduced
      below its present standard; but I would be curious to know why there is
      such a thing as an establishment at Cro' Martin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Properly speaking, there is none," said Martin. "Rep-ton alludes only to
      the workpeople,&mdash;to those employed on the grounds and the gardens. We
      cannot let the place go to ruin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is certainly no necessity for pineries and forcing-houses. Your
      niece is not likely to want grapes in January, or camellias in the early
      autumn. As little does she need sixteen carriage-horses and a stable full
      of hunters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are to be sold off next week. Mary herself said that she only wanted
      two saddle-horses and the pony for the phaeton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite sufficient, I should say, for a young lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm sure she 'd have liked to have kept the harriers&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pack of hounds! I really never heard the like!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Molly! It was her greatest pleasure,&mdash;I may say her only
      amusement in life. But she would n't hear of keeping them; and when Repton
      tried to persuade her&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Repton's an old fool,&mdash;he's worse; he's downright dishonest,&mdash;for
      he actually proposed my paying my maids out of my miserable pittance of
      eight hundred a year, and at the same moment suggests your niece retaining
      a pack of foxhounds!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harriers, my Lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care what they 're called. It is too insolent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may rely upon one thing," said Martin, with more firmness than he had
      hitherto used, "there will be nothing of extravagance in Mary's personal
      expenditure. If ever there was a girl indifferent to all the claims of
      self, she is that one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we continue this discussion, sir, at our present rate, I opine that by
      the time we reach Dublin your niece will have become an angel."
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin dropped his head, and was silent; and although her Ladyship made
      two or three other efforts to revive the argument, he seemed resolved to
      decline the challenge, and so they rolled along the road sullen and
      uncommunicative.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second carriage were Repton and Kate Henderson,&mdash;an
      arrangement which the old lawyer flatteringly believed he owed to his
      cunning and address, but which in reality was ordained by Lady Dorothea,
      whose notions of rank and precedence were rigid. Although Repton's
      greatest tact lay in his detection of character, he felt that he could not
      satisfactorily affirm he had mastered the difficulty in the present case.
      She was not exactly like anything he had met before; her mode of thought,
      and even some of her expressions were so different that the old lawyer
      owned to himself, "It was like examining a witness through an
      interpreter."
    </p>
    <p>
      A clever talker&mdash;your man of conversational success&mdash;is rarely
      patient under the failure of his powers, and, not very unreasonably
      perhaps, very ready to ascribe the ill-success to the defects of his
      hearer. They had not proceeded more than half of the first post ere Repton
      began to feel the incipient symptoms of this discontent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She evidently had no appreciation for bar anecdote and judicial wit; she
      took little interest in political events, and knew nothing of the country
      or its people. He tried the subject of foreign travel, but his own
      solitary trip to Paris and Brussels afforded but a meagre experience of
      continental life, and he was shrewd enough not to swim a yard out of his
      depth. "She must have her weak point, if I could but discover it," said he
      to himself. "It is not personal vanity, that I see. She does not want to
      be thought clever, nor even eccentric, which is the governess failing <i>par
      excellence</i>. What then can it be?" With all his ingenuity he could not
      discover. She would talk, and talk well, on any theme he started, but
      always like one who maintained conversation through politeness and not
      interest; and this very feature it was which piqued the old man's vanity,
      and irritated his self-love.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he spoke, she replied, and always with a sufficient semblance of
      interest; but if he were silent, she never opened her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so," said he, after a longer pause than usual, "you tell me that you
      really care little or nothing whither Fortune may be now conducting you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To one in my station it really matters very little," said she, calmly. "I
      don't suppose that the post-horses there have any strong preference for
      one road above another, if they be both equally level and smooth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There lies the very question," said he; "for you now admit that there may
      be a difference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never found in reality," said she, "that these differences were
      appreciable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is it that one so young should be so&mdash;so philosophic?" said he,
      after a hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had you asked me that question in French, Mr. Repton, the language would
      have come so pleasantly to your aid, and spared you the awkwardness of
      employing a grand phrase for a small quality; but my 'philosophy' is
      simply this: that, to fill a station whose casualties range from
      courtesies in the drawing-room to slights from the servants' hall, one
      must arm themselves with very defensive armor as much, nay more, against
      flattery than against sarcasm. If, in the course of time, this habit
      render one ungenial and uncompanionable, pray be lenient enough to ascribe
      the fault to the condition as much as to the individual."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, to be candid, I only recognize in you qualities the very opposite of
      all these; and if I am to confess a smart at this moment, it is in feeling
      that I am not the man to elicit them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you do me wrong. I should be very proud to captivate Mr. Repton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now we are on the good road at last!" said he, gayly; "for Mr. Repton is
      dying to be captivated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fortress that is only anxious to surrender offers no great glory to
      the conqueror," replied she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove! I 'm glad you 're not at the bar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I had been, I could never have shown the same forbearance as Mr.
      Repton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so? What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never could have refused a silk gown, sir; and they tell me you have
      done so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! they told you that," said he, coloring with pleasurable pride. "Well,
      it's quite true. The fact is correct, but I don't know what explanation
      they have given of it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was none, sir,&mdash;or, at least, none that deserved the name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what was your own reading of it?" asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simply this, sir: that a proud man may very well serve in the ranks, but
      spurn the grade of a petty officer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove; it is strange to find that a young lady should understand one's
      motives better than an old Minister," said he, with an evident
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be unjust, sir, were I to arrogate any credit to my own
      perspicuity in this case," said she, hastily; "for I was aided in my
      judgment by what, very probably, never came under the Minister's eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what was that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little volume which I discovered one day in the library, entitled 'Days
      of the Historical Society of Trinity College,' wherein I found Mr.
      Repton's name not only one of the first in debate, but the very first in
      enunciating the great truths of political liberty. In fact, I might go
      further, and say, the only one who had the courage to proclaim the great
      principles of the French Revolution."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah,&mdash;yes. I was a boy,&mdash;a mere boy,&mdash;very rash,&mdash;full
      of hope,&mdash;full of enthusiasm," said Repton, with an embarrassment
      that increased at every word. "We all took fire from the great blaze
      beside us just then; but, my dear young lady, the flame has died out,&mdash;very
      fortunately, too; for if it had n't, it would have burned us up with it.
      We were wrong,&mdash;wrong with Burke, to be sure,&mdash;<i>Errare Platone</i>,
      as one may say,&mdash;but still wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were wrong, sir, in confounding casualties with true consequences;
      wrong as a physician would be who abandoned his treatment from mistaking
      the symptoms of disease for the effects of medicine. You set out by
      declaring there was a terrible malady to be treated, and you shrink back
      affrighted at the first results of your remedies; you did worse; you
      accommodated your change of principles to party, and from the great
      champions of liberty you descended to be&mdash;modern Whigs!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what have we here? A Girondist, I verily believe!" said Repton,
      looking in her face with a smile of mingled surprise and amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't much care for the name you may give me; but I am one who thinks
      that the work of the French Revolution is sure of its accomplishment. We
      shall very probably not do the thing in the same way, but it will be done,
      nevertheless; for an Act of Parliament, though not so speedy, will be as
      effectual as a 'Noyade,' and a Reforming Administration will work as
      cleanly as a Constituent!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But see; look at France at this moment. Is not society reconstituted
      pretty near to the old models? What evidence is there that the prestige of
      rank has suffered from the shock of revolution?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best evidence. Nobody believes in it,&mdash;not one. Society is
      reconstituted just as a child constructs a card-house to see how high he
      can carry the frail edifice before it tumbles. The people&mdash;the true
      people of the Continent&mdash;look at the pageantry of a court and a
      nobility just as they do on a stage procession, and criticise it in the
      same spirit. They endure it so long as their indolence or their caprice
      permit, and then, some fine morning, they 'll dash down the whole edifice;
      and be assured that the fragments of the broken toy will never suggest the
      sentiment to repair it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a Democrat of the first water!" exclaimed Repton, in half
      amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am simply for the assertion of the truth everywhere and in everything,&mdash;in
      religion and in politics, as in art and literature. If the people be the
      source of power, don't divert the stream into another channel; and, above
      all, don't insist that it should run up-hill! Come abroad, Mr. Repton,&mdash;just
      come over with us to Paris,&mdash;and see if what I am telling you be so
      far from the fact. You 'll find, too, that it is not merely the low-born,
      the ignoble, and the poor who profess these opinions, but the great, the
      titled, and the wealthy men of fourteen quarterings and ancient lineage;
      and who, sick to death of a contest with a rich bourgeoisie, would rather
      start fair in the race again, and win whatever place their prowess or
      their capacity might giye them. You 'll hear very good socialism from the
      lips of dukes and princesses who swear by Fourier."
    </p>
    <p>
      Repton stared at her in silence, not more amazed at the words he heard
      than at the manner and air of her who spoke them; for she had gradually
      assumed a degree of earnestness and energy which imparted to her features
      a character of boldness and determination such as he had not seen in them
      before..
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," resumed she, as though following out her own thoughts, "it is your
      new creations, your ennobled banker, your starred and cordoned agitator of
      the Bourse, who now defends his order, and stands up for the divine right
      of misrule! The truly noble have other sentiments!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There 's nothing surprises me so much," said Repton, at last, "as to hear
      these sentiments from one who has lived surrounded by all the
      blandishments of a condition that owes its existence to an aristocracy,
      and never could have arisen without one,&mdash;who has lived that
      delightful life of refined leisure and elevating enjoyment, such as forms
      the atmosphere of only one class throughout the whole world. How would you
      bear to exchange this for the chaotic struggle that you point at?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for me, sir, I only saw the procession from the window. I may,
      perhaps, walk in it when I descend to the street; but really," added she,
      laughing, "this is wandering very far out of the record. I had promised
      myself to captivate Mr. Repton, and here I am, striving to array every
      feeling of his heart and every prejudice of his mind against me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is something like five-and-fifty years since I last heard such
      sentiments as you have just uttered," said Repton, gravely. "I was young
      and ardent,&mdash;full of that hopefulness in mankind which is, after all,
      the life-blood of Republicanism; and here I am now, an old, time-hardened
      lawyer, with very little faith in any one. How do you suppose that such
      opinions can chime in with all I have witnessed in the interval?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come over to Paris, sir," was her reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I would ask nothing better," rejoined he. "Did I ever tell you of
      what Harry Parsons said to Macnatty when he purposed visiting France,
      after the peace of '15? 'Now is the time to see the French capital,' said
      Mac. 'I 'll put a guinea in one pocket and a shirt in the other, and start
      to-morrow.' 'Ay, sir,' said Parsons, 'and never change either till you
      come back again!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Once back in his accustomed field, the old lawyer went along recounting
      story after story, every name seeming to suggest its own anecdote. Nor was
      Kate, now, an ungenerous listener; on the contrary, she relished his
      stores of wit and repartee. Thus they, too, went on their journey!
    </p>
    <p>
      The third carriage contained Madame Hortense, Lady Dorothea's French maid;
      Mrs. Runt, an inferior dignitary of the toilet; and Mark Peddar, Mr.
      Martin's "gentleman,"&mdash;a party which, we are forced to own, seemed to
      combine more elements of sociality than were gathered together in the
      vehicles that preceded them. To <i>their</i> share there were no regrets
      for leaving home,&mdash;no sorrow at quitting a spot endeared to them by
      long association. The sentiment was one of unalloyed satisfaction. They
      were escaping from the gloom of a long exile, and about to issue forth
      into that world which they longed for as eagerly as their betters. And why
      should they not? Are not all its pleasures, all its associations more
      essentially adapted to such natures; and has solitude one single
      compensation for all its depression to such as these?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our noble selves," said Mr. Peddar, filling the ladies' glasses, and then
      his own; for a very appetizing luncheon was there spread out before them,
      and four bottles of long-necked gracefulness rose from amidst the crystal
      ruins of a well-filled ice-pail. "Mam'selle, it is your favorite tipple,
      and deliciously cool."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfection," replied mademoiselle, with a foreign accent, for she had
      been long in England; "and I never enjoyed it more. <i>Au revoir</i>,"
      added she, waving her hand towards the tall towers of Cro' Martin, just
      visible above the trees,&mdash;"<i>Au revoir!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so,&mdash;till I see you again," said Mrs. Runt; "and I 'm sure I
      'll take good care that day won't come soon. It seems like a terrible
      nightmare when I think of the eight long years I passed there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Et moi</i>, twelve! Miladi engage me, so to say, <i>provisoirement</i>,
      to come to Ireland, but with a promise of travel abroad; that we live in
      Paris, Rome, Naples,&mdash;<i>que sais-je?</i> I accept,&mdash;I arrive,&mdash;<i>et
      me voici!</i>" And mademoiselle threw back her veil, the better to direct
      attention to the ravages time and exile had made upon her charms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hard lines, ma'am," said Peddar, whose sympathy must not be accused of an
      <i>equivoque</i>; "and here am I, that left the best single-handed
      situation in all England,&mdash;Sir Augustus Hawleigh's,&mdash;a young
      fellow just of age, and that never knew what money was, to come down here
      at a salary positively little better than a country curate's, and live the
      life of&mdash;of&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, the leg, if you please, Mr. Peddar; no more wine. Well, just one
      glass, to drink a hearty farewell to the old house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm sure I wish Mary joy of her residence there," said Peddar, adjusting
      his cravat; "she is a devilish fine girl, and might do better, though."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has no ambitions,&mdash;no what you call them?&mdash;no aspirations
      for <i>le grand monde</i>; so perhaps she has reason to stay where she
      is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But with a young fellow of <i>ton</i> and fashion, mam'selle,&mdash;a
      fellow who has seen life,&mdash;to guide and bring her out, trust me,
      there are excellent capabilities in that girl." And as Mr. Peddar
      enunciated the sentiment, his hands ran carelessly through his hair, and
      performed a kind of impromptu toilet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She do dress herself <i>bien mal</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Disgracefully so," chimed in Mrs. Runt "I believe, whenever she bought a
      gown, her first thought was what it should turn into when she 'd done with
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought that la Henderson might have taught her something," said
      Peddar, affectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Au contraire</i>,&mdash;she like to make the contrast more strong; she
      always seek to make say, '<i>Regardez</i>, mademoiselle, see what a <i>tournure</i>
      is there!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think her handsome, Mr. Peddar?" asked Mrs. Runt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Handsome, yes; but not <i>my</i> style,&mdash;not one of what <i>I</i>
      call <i>my</i> women; too much of this kind of thing, eh?" And he drew his
      head back, and threw into his features an expression of exaggerated scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so. Downright impudent, I'd call it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not even that," said Mr. Peddar, pondering; "haughty, rather,&mdash;a
      kind of don't-think-to-come-it-on-me style of look, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all amiable,&mdash;<i>point de cela,</i>" exclaimed mam'selle;
      "but still, I will say, <i>très bon genre</i>. You see at a glance that
      she has seen <i>la bonne société.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which, after all, is the same all the world over," said Peddar,
      dogmatically. "At Vienna we just saw the same people we used to have with
      us in London; at Rome, the same; so, too, at Naples. I assure you that the
      last time I dined at Dolgorouki's, I proposed going in the evening to the
      Haymarket. I quite forgot we were on the Neva. And when Prince
      Gladuatoffski's gentleman said, 'Where shall I set you down?' I answered
      carelessly, 'At my chambers in the Albany, or anywhere your Highness likes
      near that.' Such is life!" exclaimed he, draining the last of the
      champagne into his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The place will be pretty dull without us, I fancy," said Mrs. Runt,
      looking out at the distant landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That horrid old Mother Broon won't say so," said Peddar, laughing. "By
      Jove! if it was only to escape that detestable hag, it 's worth while
      getting away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I offer her my hand when I descend the steps, but she refuse <i>froidement</i>,
      and say, 'I wish you as much pleasure as you leave behind you.' <i>Pas mal</i>
      for such a <i>creature</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did n't even notice her," said Mrs. Runt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Ma foi!</i> I was good with all the world; I was in such Joy&mdash;such
      spirits&mdash;that I forgave all and everything. I felt <i>nous sommes en
      route</i>, and Paris&mdash;dear Paris&mdash;before us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My own sentiments to, a T," said Mr. Peddar. "Let me live on the
      Boulevards, have my cab, my stall at the Opera, two Naps, per diem for my
      dinner, and I'd not accept Mary Martin's hand if she owned Cro' Martin,
      and obliged me to live in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The speech was fully and warmly acknowledged, other subjects were started,
      and so they travelled the same road as their betters, and perhaps with
      lighter hearts.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. COUNTRY AUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      With feelings akin to those with which the populace of a revolted city
      invade the once sacred edifice of the deposed Prince, the whole town and
      neighborhood of Oughterard now poured into the demesne of Cro' Martin,
      wandered through the grounds, explored the gardens, and filled the house.
      An immense advertisement in the local papers had announced a general sale
      of horses and carriages, farming stock, and agricultural implements;
      cattle of choice breeding, sheep of fabulous facilities for fat, and cows
      of every imaginable productiveness, were there, with draft-horses like
      dwarf elephants, and bulls that would have puzzled a matador.
    </p>
    <p>
      The haughty state in which the Martins habitually lived, the wide distance
      by which they separated themselves from the neighborhood around, had
      imparted to Cro' Martin a kind of dreamy splendor in the country, exalting
      even its well-merited claims to admiration. Some had seen the grounds, a
      few had by rare accident visited the gardens, but the house and the
      stables were still unexplored territories, of whose magnificence each
      spoke without a fear of contradiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Country neighborhoods are rarely rich in events, and of these, few can
      rival a great auction. It is not alone in the interests of barter and gain
      thus suggested, but in the thousand new channels for thought thus suddenly
      opened,&mdash;the altered fortunes of him whose effects have come to the
      hammer; his death, or his banishment,&mdash;both so much alike. The
      visitor wanders amidst objects which have occupied years in collection,&mdash;some
      the results of considerable research and difficulty, some the long-coveted
      acquisitions of half a lifetime, and some&mdash;we have known such&mdash;the
      fond gifts of friendship. There they are now side by side in the
      catalogue, their private histories no more suspected than those of them
      who lie grass-covered in the churchyard. You admire that highly bred
      hunter in all the beauty of his symmetry and his strength, but you never
      think of the "little Shelty" in the next stable with shaggy mane and
      flowing tail; and yet it was on <i>him</i> the young heir used to ride; <i>he</i>
      was the cherished animal of all the stud, led in beside the
      breakfast-table to be caressed and petted, fed with sugar from fair
      fingers, and patted by hands a Prince might have knelt to kiss! His rider
      now sleeps beneath the marble slab in the old aisle, and they who once
      brightened in smiles at the sound of his tiny trot would burst into tears
      did they behold that pony!
    </p>
    <p>
      So, amidst the triumphs of color and design that grace the walls, you have
      no eyes for a little sketch in water-color,&mdash;a mill, a shealing
      beside a glassy brook, a few trees, and a moss-clad rock; and yet that
      little drawing reveals a sad story. It is all that remains of her who went
      abroad to die. You throw yourself in listless lassitude upon a couch; it
      was the work of one who beguiled over it the last hours of a broken heart!
      You turn your steps to the conservatory, but never notice the little
      flower-garden, whose narrow walks, designed for tiny feet, need not the
      little spade to tell of the child-gardener who tilled it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ay, this selling-off is a sad process! It bespeaks the disruption of a
      home; the scattering of those who once sat around the same hearth, with
      all the dear familiar things about them!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bright spring morning&mdash;one of those breezy, cloud-flitting
      days, with flashes of gay sunlight alternating with broad shadows, and
      giving in the tamest landscape every effect the painter's art could summon&mdash;that
      a long procession, consisting of all imaginable vehicles, with many on
      horseback intermixed, wound their way beneath the grand entrance and
      through the park of Cro' Martin. Such an opportunity of gratifying long
      pent-up curiosity had never before offered; since, even when death itself
      visited the mansion, the habits of exclusion were not relaxed, but the
      Martins went to their graves in the solemn state of their households
      alone, and were buried in a little chapel within the grounds, the faint
      tolling of the bell alone announcing to the world without that one of a
      proud house had departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pace of the carriages was slow as they moved along, their occupants
      preferring to linger in a scene from which they had been hitherto
      excluded, struck by the unexpected beauty of the spot, and wondering at
      all the devices by which it was adorned. A few&mdash;a very few&mdash;had
      seen the place in boyhood, and were puzzling themselves to recall this and
      that memory; but all agreed in pronouncing that the demesne was far finer,
      the timber better grown, and the fields more highly cultivated than
      anything they had ever before seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I call this the finest place in Ireland, Dan!" said Captain Bodkin, as he
      rode beside Nelligan's car, halting every now and then to look around him.
      "There's everything can make a demesne beautiful,&mdash;wood, water, and
      mountain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, better than all, a fine system of farming," broke in Nelligan.
      "That's the best field of 'swedes' I ever beheld!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And to think that a man would leave this to go live abroad in a dirty
      town in France!" exclaimed Mrs. Clinch, from the opposite side of the car.
      "That's perverseness indeed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Them there is all Swiss cows!" said Mr. Clinch, in an humble tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not one of them, Clinch! they're Alderneys. The Swiss farm, as they call
      it, is all on the other side, with the ornamented cottage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear! dear! there was no end to their waste and extravagance!" muttered
      Mrs. Nelligan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait till you see the house, ma'am, and you 'll say so, indeed," said the
      Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think we 're likely!" observed Nelligan, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just that Scanlan told Father Mather the auction would be held in the
      stables; for as there was none of the furniture to be sold, the house
      would n't be opened."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a great disappointment!" exclaimed Bodkin. A sentiment fully
      concurred in by the ladies, who both declared that they'd never have, come
      so far only to look at pigs and "shorthorns."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe we 'll get a peep at the gardens," said Bodkin, endeavoring to
      console them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the sow!" broke in Peter Hayes, who had joined the party some time
      before. "They tell me she's a beauty. She's Lord Somebody's breed, and
      beats the world for fat!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's Scanlan now, and he 'll tell us everything," said Bodkin. But the
      sporting attorney, mounted on a splendid little horse, in top condition,
      passed them at speed, the few words he uttered being lost as he dashed by.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was it he said?" cried Bodkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't catch the words," replied Nelligan; "and I suppose it was no
      great loss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's an impudent upstart!" exclaimed Mrs. Clinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think he said something about a breakfast," meekly interposed Mr.
      Clinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And of course he said nothing of the kind," retorted his spouse. "You
      never happened to be right in your life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix! I made sure of mine before I started," said old Hayes, "I ate a
      cowld goose!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, to be sure, they could n't be expected to entertain all that's
      coming!" said Mrs. Nelligan, who now began a mental calculation of the
      numbers on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There will be a thousand people here to-day," said Bodkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five times that," said Nelligan. "I know it by the number of small bills
      that I gave cash for the last week. There's not a farmer in the county
      does n't expect to bring back with him a prize beast of one kind or
      other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll buy that sow if she goes 'reasonable,'" said Peter Hayes, whose
      whole thoughts seemed centred on the animal in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do they mean to do when they sell off the stock?" asked the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear that the place will be let," said Nelligan, in a half whisper, "if
      they can find a tenant for it. Henderson told Father Mather that, come
      what might, her Ladyship would never come back here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix! the only one of them worth a groat was Miss Mary, and I suppose
      they did n't leave her the means to do much now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis she must have the heavy heart to-day," sighed Mrs. Nelligan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it is only fair and reasonable she should have her share of troubles,
      like the rest of us," replied Mrs. Clinch. "When Clinch was removed from
      Macroon, we had to sell off every stick and stone we had; and as the
      neighbors knew we must go, we didn't get five shillings in the pound by
      the sale."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's mighty grand,&mdash;that is really a fine place!" exclaimed
      Bodkin, as by a sudden turn of the road they came directly in front of the
      house; and the whole party sat in silent admiration of the magnificent
      edifice before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a royal palace,&mdash;no less," said Nelligan, at last; "and that's
      exactly what no country gentleman wants. Sure we know well there's no
      fortune equal to such a residence. To keep up that house, as it ought to
      be, a man should have thirty thousand a year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me fifteen, Dan, and you'll see if I don't make it comfortable,",
      said Bodkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's this barrier here,&mdash;can't we go any further?" exclaimed
      Nelligan, as he perceived a strong paling across the avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We 're to go round by the stables, it seems," said Bodkin; "the hall
      entrance is not to be invaded by such vulgar visitors. This is our road,
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if I ever!" exclaimed Mrs. Clinch, whose feelings really
      overpowered utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see any great hardship in this after all, ma'am," said Nelligan;
      "for we know if the family were at home we couldn't even be here. Drive
      on, Tim."
    </p>
    <p>
      A short circuit through a very thickly wooded tract brought them at length
      to a large and massive gateway, over which the Martins' arms were
      sculptured in stone; passing through which they entered a great courtyard,
      three sides of which were occupied by stables, the fourth presenting a
      range of coach-houses filled with carriages of every description.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large tent was erected in the midst of the court for the convenience of
      the sale, in front of which were pens for the cattle, and a space railed
      off, wherein the horses were to be viewed and examined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is all mighty well arranged," said Bodkin, as he gave his horse to a
      groom, who, in the undress livery of Cro' Martin, came respectfully to his
      aid as he got down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sale will begin in about an hour, sir," said the man, in answer to a
      question. "Mr. Scanlan is now in the house with Mr. Gibbs, the
      auctioneer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vast crowds of people of every class, from the small squire to the
      Oughterard shopkeeper and country farmer, now came pouring in, all eager
      in their curiosity, but somehow all subdued into a kind of reverence for a
      spot from which they had been so rigidly excluded, and the very aspect of
      which so far transcended expectations. Everything, indeed, was an object
      of wonderment. The ornamental tanks for watering the horses, supplied by
      beautifully designed fountains; the sculptured medallions along the walls,
      emblematizing the chase or the road; the bright mahogany partitions of the
      stalls, even to the little channels lined with shining copper, all
      demanded notice and comment; and many were the wise reflections uttered
      with regard to those who thus squandered away their wealth. The sight of
      the cattle, however, which occupied this luxurious abode, went far to
      disarm this criticism, since certainly none ever seemed more worthy of the
      state and splendor that surrounded them. For these the admiration was
      hearty and sincere, and the farmers went along the stalls amazed and
      wonderstruck at the size and symmetry of the noble animals that filled
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sold at Tattersall's, sir, on the 4th of next month," said a groom,
      whose English accent imparted an almost sneer to the supposition that such
      a stud should meet purchasers in Ireland. "They 're all advertised in
      'Bell's Life.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What becomes of the hounds?" asked Bodkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord Cromore takes them, sir; they're to hunt in Dorsetshire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the sow?" asked old Hayes, with eagerness; "she isn't to go to
      England, is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't say, sir. We don't look arter no sows here," replied the fellow, as
      he turned away in evident disgust at his questioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain stir and bustle in the court without gave token that the sale
      was about to begin; and Scanlan's voice, in its most authoritative tone,
      was heard issuing orders and directions on all sides, while servants went
      hither and thither distributing catalogues, and securing accommodation for
      the visitors with a degree of deference and attention most remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose we're to pass the day in the stables or the cowhouses, ma'am?"
      said Mrs. Clinch, as with a look of indignation she gazed at the range of
      seats now being hastily occupied by a miscellaneous company.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we could only get into the gardens," said Mrs. Nelligan, timidly. "I'm
      sure if I saw Barnes he'd let us in." And she slipped rapidly from her
      friend's arm, and hastily crossing the court, went in search of her only
      acquaintance in the household. "Did you see Barnes? Where could I find
      Barnes?" asked she of almost every one she met. And following the
      complicated directions she received, she wandered onward, through a
      kitchen-garden, and into a small nursery beyond it. Bewildered as she
      receded beyond the sounds of the multitude, she turned into a little path
      which, traversing a shrubbery, opened upon a beautifully cultivated
      "parterre," whose close-shaven sward and flowery beds flanked a long range
      of windows opening to the ground, and which, to her no small horror, she
      perceived to form one wing of the mansion. While in her distraction to
      think what course was best to take, she saw a groom standing at the head
      of a small pony, harnessed to a diminutive carriage, and hastily
      approached him. Before, however, she had attained within speaking
      distance, the man motioned to her, by a gesture, to retire. Her
      embarrassment gave her, if not courage, something of resolution, and she
      advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go back!" cried he, in a smothered voice; "there 's no one admitted
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I 've lost my way. I was looking for Barnes&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's not here. Go back, I say," reiterated the man, in the same stealthy
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But poor Mrs. Nelligan, came on, confusion rendering her indifferent to
      all reproof, and in spite of gestures and admonitions to retire, steadily
      advanced towards the door. As she passed one of the open windows, her
      glance caught something within; she stopped suddenly, and, in seeming
      shame at her intrusion, turned to go back. A muttered malediction from the
      servant increased her terror, and she uttered a faint cry. In an instant
      the object at which she had been gazing arose, and Mary Martin, her face
      traced with recent tears, started up and approached her. Mrs. Nelligan
      felt a sense of sickly faintness come over her, and had to grasp the
      window for support.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear young lady!" she muttered, "I did n't mean to do this&mdash;I
      strayed here by accident&mdash;I didn't know where I was going&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Mrs. Nelligan, there is no need of these excuses," said Mary,
      taking her hand cordially, and leading her to a seat. "It is a great
      pleasure to me to see a friendly face, and I am grateful for the chance
      that sent you here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Nelligan, once relieved of her first embarrassment, poured forth with
      volubility the explanation of her presence; and Mary heard her to the end
      with patient politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you were going away somewhere," resumed she, "when I stopped you. I
      see your pony-chaise there at the door waiting for you, and you're off to
      the quarries or Kilkieran, I 'll be bound; or maybe it's only going away
      you are, to be out of this for a day or two. God knows, I don't wonder at
      it! It is a trying scene for you, and a great shock to your feelings, to
      see the place dismantled, and everything sold off!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is sad enough," said Mary, smiling through her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to say that you're left here all alone, just as if you were n't one
      of the family at all; that 's what I think most of. And where were you
      going, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was going to pass a few days at the cottage,&mdash;the Swiss cottage.
      Catty Broon, my old nurse, has gone over there to get it in readiness for
      me, and I shall probably stay there till all this confusion be over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure, dear. What's more natural than that you'd like to spare your
      feelings, seeing all carried away just as if it was bankrupts you were.
      Indeed, Dan said to me the things wouldn't bring more than at a sheriff's
      sale, because of the hurry you were in to sell them off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My uncle's orders were positive on that subject," said Mary, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear, of course he knows best," said she, with a shake of the head
      not exactly corroborating her own speech. "And how are you to live here by
      yourself, dear?" resumed she; "sure you 'll die of the loneliness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think so: I shall have plenty to occupy me,&mdash;more, indeed,
      than I shall be equal to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, in the daytime; but the long evenings&mdash;think of the long
      evenings, dear! God knows, I find them very often dreary enough, even
      though I have a home and Dan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm not afraid of the long evenings, my dear Mrs. Nelligan. It is the
      only time I can spare for reading; they will be my hours of recreation and
      amusement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, I hope so, with all my heart," said she, doubtingly. "You
      know yourself best, and maybe you'd be happier that way, than if you had
      somebody to talk to and keep you company."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't say that," said Mary, smiling. "I never implied that a visit
      from some kind friend&mdash;Mrs. Nelligan, for instance&mdash;would not be
      a very pleasant event in my solitude."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To come and see you,&mdash;to come to Cro' Martin!" exclaimed Mrs.
      Nelligan, as though trying to reconcile her mind to the bare possibility
      of such a circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you would not think it too far, or too much trouble&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh dear, oh dear, but it's too much honor it would be; and Dan&mdash;no
      matter what he 'd say to the contrary&mdash;would feel it so, in his own
      heart. Sure I know well how he felt about Joe being asked here to dinner;
      and he 'd never have taken a part against your uncle in the election if it
      was n't that he thought Joe was slighted some way&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But nothing of the kind ever occurred. Mr..Joseph Nelligan met from us
      all the respect that his character and his talents entitled him to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't get warm about it, or I 'll forget everything that's in my head!"
      exclaimed Mrs. Nelligan, in terror at the eagerness of Mary's manner.
      "Maybe it was Joe's fault&mdash;maybe it was young Massingbred's&mdash;maybe
      it was&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what was it?" cried Mary. "What was alleged? What was laid to our
      charge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, now, I don't remember anything; you frightened me so that it's
      gone clean out of my mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear friend," said Mary, caressingly, "I never meant to alarm you; and
      let us talk of something else. You say that you 'll come to see me
      sometimes; is it a promise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed it is, my dear, whenever Dan gives me the car and horse&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I 'll drive in for you, and bring you safely back again. You 've only
      to say when you 'll spend the day with me; and there's so much to show you
      here that you 'd like to see. The gardens are really handsome, and the
      hothouses. And Catty will show us her dairy, and I am very proud of my
      lambs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is all like a dream to me,&mdash;just like a dream," said Mrs.
      Nelligan, closing her eyes, and folding her arms, "to think that I 'm
      sitting here, at Cro' Martin, talking to Miss Mary just as if I were her
      equal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, dear friend, it shall be a reality whenever you like to make it
      so; and you'll tell me all the news of Oughterard,&mdash;all about every
      one there; for I know them, at least by name, and will be charmed to hear
      about them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Scanlan wants an answer, miss, immediately," said a servant,
      presenting Mary with a few lines written in pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the paper and read the following: "Nelligan offers seventy
      pounds for the two black horses. Is he to have them? Sir Peter shows an
      incipient spavin on the off leg, and I think he 'd be well sold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell Mr. Scanlan I 'll send him an answer by and by," said she,
      dismissing the servant. Then ringing the bell, she whispered a few words
      to the man who answered it. "I have just sent a message to tell Mr.
      Nelligan I wish to speak to him," said she, resuming her place on the
      sofa. "It is a mere business matter," added she, seeing that Mrs. Nelligan
      waited for some explanation. "And now, when have you heard from your son?
      Is he learning to spare himself anything of those great efforts he imposes
      upon his faculties?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was to touch the most sensitive chord in all her heart; and so she
      burst forth into a description of Joseph's daily life of toil and study;
      his labors, his self-denial, his solitary, joyless existence, all calling
      up, in turn, her praises and her sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I," cried she, "am always saying, what is it all for?&mdash;what's
      the use of it?&mdash;who is to be the better of it? Sure there 's only
      himself to get whatever his father leaves behind him; and a pretty penny
      it is! Not that <i>you</i> would think so; but for the like of <i>us</i>,
      and in <i>our</i> station, it's a snug fortune. He 'll have upwards of two
      thousand a year, so that there 's no need to be slaving like a Turk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your son's ambitions take, very probably, a higher range than mere
      money-making," said Mary. "He has a good right to suppose that his
      abilities may win him the highest of rewards! But here's Mr. Nelligan."
      And she advanced courteously to meet him at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flushed and heated by the scene he had just quitted, and evidently
      embarrassed by the situation in which he stood, Nelligan bowed repeatedly
      in reply to Miss Martin's greeting, starting with amazement as he
      perceived Mrs. Nelligan, who maintained an air of unbroken dignity on the
      sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well you may stare, Dan!" said she. "I 'm sure you never expected to see
      me here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a most agreeable surprise for <i>me</i>, at least," said Mary,
      motioning to a seat; then, turning to Nelligan, added, "This little note
      was the occasion of my asking you to step over here. Will you please to
      read it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How handsome, how candid, Miss Martin!" said Nelligan, as he restored it,
      after perusing it. "Ah, my dear young lady, why would n't your family deal
      always with us in this fashion and in everything? I beg your forgiveness,
      but I forgot myself. I 'll stick to my offer, miss,&mdash;I wouldn't take
      fifty pounds for my bargain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This, of course, is in confidence between us, sir," said Mary, as she
      tore up the note and threw the fragments on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0013" id="linkimage-0013">

    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/368.jpg" width="100%" alt="368 " />
    </div>
    <p>
      "I wish I knew how to acknowledge this, Miss Martin; I wish I could show
      how sensible one in <i>my</i> station could be of generosity from one in
      <i>yours</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You remind me very opportunely that I have a favor to ask, Mr. Nelligan.
      It is this: My kind friend here, Mrs. Nelligan, has just promised to take
      pity on my solitude, and occasionally to come and see me. Will you kindly
      strengthen her in this benevolent intention, and aid her to turn her steps
      very often towards Cro' Martin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nelligan's face grew deeply red, and an expression of the greatest
      embarrassment settled down on his features; and it was with much
      difficulty, and in a voice laboring for utterance, that he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see how this can be. Your friends would not approve,&mdash;your
      family, I mean, Miss Martin,&mdash;would, very naturally, resent the
      thought of such an intimacy! They look upon <i>me</i> as an enemy,&mdash;an
      open and declared enemy,&mdash;and so I am, where politics is concerned;
      but&mdash;" He hesitated, and after a struggle went on: "No matter, it <i>is</i>
      war between us, and must be till one crushes the other. What I mean is
      this, young lady: that to encourage such acquaintanceship as you speak of
      would look like an undue condescension on <i>your</i> part, or something
      even worse on <i>ours</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll not listen to such subtleties!" cried Mary, hastily. "Neither you
      nor I, my dear Mrs. Nelligan, care for party triumphs or defeats. There
      are a thousand themes wherein our hearts can feel alike; and these we 'll
      discuss together. We're of the same country; have passed our lives amidst
      the same scenes, the same events, and the same people, and it will be hard
      if we cannot as easily discover topics for mutual esteem, as subjects of
      difference and disagreement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But will it not be hinted, Miss Martin, that we took the opportunity of
      your solitude here to impose an acquaintanceship which had been impossible
      under other circumstances?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you are too proud, sir, to know me,&mdash;lest an ungenerous sneer
      should damage your self-esteem&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, indeed we're not," broke in Mrs. Nelligan. "You don't know Dan at
      all. He would n't exchange the honor of sitting there, opposite you, to be
      High Sheriff."
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant fortunately presented himself at this awkward moment with a
      whispered message for Miss Martin; to which she replied aloud,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. Tell Mr. Scanlan it is my wish,&mdash;<i>my</i> orders," added
      she, more firmly. "The house is open to any one who desires to see it. And
      now, before I go, Mr. Nelligan, tell me that I have convinced you,&mdash;tell
      me that my reasons have prevailed, and that you acknowledge we ought to be
      friends." And as she said the last words, she held out her hand to him
      with a grace so perfect, and an air of such winning fascination, that old
      Nelligan could only stammer out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shall be how you please. I never bargained to dispute against such
      odds as this. We are, indeed, your friends; dispose of us how you like."
      And, so saying, he conducted her to the little carriage, and, assisting
      her to her seat, took his leave with all the respect he could have shown a
      queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's more than a prejudice, after all," muttered he, as he looked after
      her as she drove away. "There's something deeper and stronger in it than
      that, or else a few words spoken by a young girl could n't so suddenly
      rout all the sentiments of a lifetime! Ay, ay," added he, still to
      himself, "we may pull them down; we may humble them; but we 'll never fill
      their places!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And we 're to see the house, it seems!" exclaimed Mrs. Nelligan,
      gathering her shawl around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care to look at it till she herself is here!" said old Nelligan,
      taking his wife's arm, and leading her away across the lawn, and in the
      direction of the stables. There was that in his moody preoccupation which
      did not encourage her to venture on a word, and so she went along at his
      side in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're to have the black horses, Mr. Nelligan," said Scanlan, overtaking
      him. Nelligan nodded. "You 've got a cheap pair of nags, and as good as
      gold," continued he. A dry half-smile was all the reply. "Mr. Martin bred
      them himself," Scanlan went on, "and no price would have bought them three
      weeks ago; but everything is going for a song to-day! I don't know how I
      'll muster courage to tell them the results of the sale!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 'll have courage for more than that," said Nelligan. And although
      only a chance shot, it fell into a magazine; for Scanlan grew crimson, and
      then pale, and seemed ready to faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nelligan stared with amazement at the effect his few words had produced,
      and then passed on; while the attorney muttered between his teeth, "Can he
      suspect me? Is it possible that I have betrayed myself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Maurice Scanlan. Be of good cheer, your secret is safe. No one has as
      much as the very barest suspicion that the pettifogging practitioner
      aspires to the hand of Mary Martin; nor even in the darkest dreams of that
      house's downfall has such a humiliation obtruded itself anywhere!

      CHAPTER XXVI. "REVERSES"
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ours is a very practical age, and no matter how skilfully a man play the
      game of life, there is but one test of his ability,&mdash;did he win? If
      this condition attend him, his actions meet charitable construction. His
      doings are all favorably regarded; and while his capacity is extolled,
      even his shortcomings are extenuated. We dread an unlucky man! There is a
      kind of contagion in calamity, and we shun him as though he were
      plague-stricken. But with what flatteries we greet the successful one!
      That he reached the goal is the sure guarantee of his merits; and woe to
      him who would canvass the rectitude of his progress! Defeat is such a
      leveller! Genius and dulness, courage and pusillanimity, high-hearted hope
      and wasting energy, are all confounded together by failure, and the world
      would only smile at any effort to discriminate between them. Perhaps in
      the main the system works well. Perhaps mankind, incapable of judging
      motives, too impatient to investigate causes, is wise in adopting a short
      cut for its decisions. Certain it is, the rule is absolute that proclaims
      Success to be Desert!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Dorothea was now about to experience this severe lesson, and not the
      less heavily that she never anticipated it. After a wearisome journey the
      Martins arrived in Dublin. The apartments secured to them, by a previous
      letter, at Bilton's, were all in readiness for their reception. The
      "Saunders" of the day duly chronicled their arrival; but there the great
      event seemed to terminate. No message from her Ladyship's noble kinsman
      greeted their coming; no kind note of welcome,&mdash;not even a visit from
      Mr. Lawrence Belcour, the aide-de-camp in waiting. The greatest of all
      moralists warns us against putting confidence in princes; and how doubly
      truthful is the adage when extended to viceroys! Small as was the borough
      of Oughterard, and insignificant as seemed the fact who should be its
      representative, the result of the election was made a great matter at the
      "Castle." His Excellency was told that the Martins had mismanaged
      everything. They had gone to work in the old Tory cut-and-thrust fashion
      of former days&mdash;conciliated no interest, won over no antagonism; they
      had acted "precisely as if there had been no Relief Bill,"&mdash;we steal
      Colonel Massingbred's words,&mdash;and they were beaten&mdash;beaten in
      their own town&mdash;in the person of one of their own family, and by a
      stranger! The Viceroy was vexed. They had misconstrued every word of his
      letter,&mdash;a letter that, as he said, any child might have understood,&mdash;and
      there was a vote lost to his party. It was in vain that the Chief
      Secretary assured his Excellency "Jack was a clever fellow, who 'd put all
      to rights;" that with a little time and a little dexterity he 'd be able
      to vote with the Ministry on every important division; the great fact
      remained unatoned for,&mdash;his family, his own connections, "had done
      nothing for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The first day in town dragged its length slowly over. Martin was fatigued,
      and did not go abroad, and no one came to visit him. To do him justice, he
      was patient under the neglect; to say more, he was grateful for it. It was
      so pleasant "to be let alone;" not even to be obliged to see Henderson,
      nor to be consulted about "Road Sessions" or "Police Reports," but to have
      one's day in total unbroken listlessness; to have simply to say, "We 'll
      dine at seven," and "I'm out for every one." Far otherwise fared it in my
      "Lady's chamber." All her plans had been based upon the attentions she was
      so certain of receiving, but of which now not a sign gave token. She
      passed the day in a state of almost feverish excitement, the more painful
      from her effort to conceal and control it. Repton dined with them. He came
      that day "because, of course, he could not expect to catch them disengaged
      on any future occasion." Her Ladyship was furious at the speech, but
      smiled concurrence to it; while Martin carelessly remarked, "From all that
      I see, we may enjoy the same pleasure very often." Never was the old
      lawyer so disagreeable when exerting himself to be the opposite. He had
      come stored with all the doings of the capital,&mdash;its dinners and
      evening parties, its <i>mots</i> and its gossip. From the political rumors
      and the chit-chat of society, he went on to speak of the viceregal court
      and its festivities.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there be anything I detest," said her Ladyship, at last, "it is the
      small circle of a very small metropolis. So long as you look at it
      carelessly, it is not so offensive; but when you stoop to consider and
      examine it with attention, it reminds you of the hideous spectacle of a
      glass of water as seen through a magnifier,&mdash;you detect a miniature
      world of monsters and deformities, all warring and worrying each other."
      And with this flattering exposition of her opinion, she arose speedily
      after dinner, and, followed by Miss Henderson, retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I perceive that we had not the ear of the Court for our argument," said
      Repton, as he resumed his place after conducting her to the door. Martin
      sipped his wine in silence. "I never expected she'd like Dublin; it only
      suits those who pass their lives in it; but I fancied that what with
      Castle civilities&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There 's the rub," broke in Martin, but in a voice subdued almost to a
      whisper. "They 've taken no notice of us. For my own part, I 'm heartily
      obliged to them; and if they 'd condescend to feel offended with us, I 'd
      only be more grateful; but my Lady&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      A long, low whistle from Repton implied that he had fully appreciated the
      "situation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I see it," cried he; "and this explains the meaning of an article I
      read this morning in the 'Evening Post,'&mdash;the Government organ,&mdash;wherein
      it is suggested that country gentlemen would be more efficient supporters
      of the administration if they lent themselves heartily to comprehend the
      requirements of recent legislation, than by exacting heavy reprisals on
      their tenants in moments of defeat and disappointment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is rather hard," said Martin, with more of energy than he
      usually spoke in,&mdash;"it <i>is</i> hard! They first hounded us on to
      contest the borough for them, and they now abuse us that we did not make a
      compromise with the opposite party. And as to measures of severity, you
      know well I never concurred in them; I never permitted them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But they are mistaken, nevertheless. There are writs in preparation, and
      executions about to issue over fourteen town-lands. There will be a
      general clearance of the population at Kyle-a-Noe. You 'll not know a face
      there when you go back, Martin!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who can say that I 'll ever go back?" said he, mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, I trust you will. I hope to pass some pleasant days with you
      there ere I die," said Repton, cheer-ingly. "Indeed, until you are there
      again, I 'll never go farther west than Athlone on my circuit. I 'd not
      like to, look at the old place without you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin nodded as he raised his glass, as if to thank him, and then dropped
      his head mournfully, and sat without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor dear Mary!" said he, at last, with a heavy sigh. "Our desertion of
      her is too bad. It's not keeping the pledge I made to Barry!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, there's nothing easier than the remedy. A week or so will see
      you settled in some city abroad,&mdash;Paris, or Brussels, perhaps. Let
      her join you; I 'll be her escort. Egad! I'd like the excuse for the
      excursion," replied Repton, gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, Repton," said the other, pursuing his own thoughts and not heeding
      the interruption, "and <i>you</i> know what a brother he was. By Jove!"
      cried he, aloud, "were Barry just to see what we 've done,&mdash;how we
      've treated the place, the people, his daughter!&mdash;were he only to
      know how I 've kept my word with him&mdash;Look, Repton," added he,
      grasping the other's arm as he spoke, "there's not as generous a fellow
      breathing as Barry; this world has not his equal for an act of noble
      self-devotion and sacrifice. His life!&mdash;he 'd not think twice of it
      if I asked him to give it for me; but if he felt&mdash;if he could just
      awaken to the conviction that he was unfairly dealt with, that when
      believing he was sacrificing to affection and brotherly love he was made a
      dupe and a fool of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be cautious, Martin; speak lower&mdash;remember where you are," said
      Repton, guardedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you this," resumed the other, in a tone less loud but not less
      forcible: "the very warmth of his nature&mdash;that same noble, generous
      source that feeds every impulse of his life&mdash;would supply the force
      of a torrent to his passion; he 'd be a tiger if you aroused him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you perceive, my dear friend," said Repton, calmly, "how you are
      exaggerating everything,&mdash;not alone <i>your own</i> culpability, but
      his resentment! Grant that you ought not to have left Mary behind you,&mdash;I
      'm sure I said everything I could against it,&mdash;what more easy than to
      repair the wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, Repton, you 're quite mistaken. Take my word for it, you don't
      know that girl. She has taught herself to believe that her place is there,&mdash;that
      it is her duty to live amongst the people. She may exaggerate to her own
      mind the good she does; she may fancy a thousand things as to the benefit
      she bestows; but she cannot, by any self-deception, over-estimate the
      results upon her own heart, which she has educated to feel as only they do
      who live amongst the poor! To take her away from this would be a cruel
      sacrifice; and for what?&mdash;a world she would n't care for, couldn't
      comprehend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what was to have been done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll tell you, Repton; if it was <i>her</i> duty to stay there, it was
      doubly <i>ours</i> to have remained also. When she married," added he,
      after a pause,&mdash;"when she had got a home of her own,&mdash;then, of
      course, it would have been quite different! Heaven knows," said he,
      sighing, "we have little left to tie us to anything or anywhere; and as to
      myself, it is a matter of the most perfect indifference whether I drag out
      the year or two that may remain to me on the shores of Galway or beside
      the Adriatic!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't bear this," cried Repton, angrily. "If ever there was a man well
      treated by fortune, you are he."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm not complaining."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not complaining! but, hang it, sir, that is not enough! You should be
      overflowing with gratitude; your life ought to be active with benevolence;
      you should be up and doing, wherever ample means and handsome
      encouragement could assist merit or cheer despondency. I like your notion
      that you don't complain! Why, if you did, what should be done by those who
      really do travel the shady side of existence,&mdash;who are weighted with
      debt, bowed down with daily difficulties, crippled with that penury that
      eats into a man's nature till his very affections grow sordid, and his
      very dreams are tormented with his duns! Think of the poor fellows with
      ailing wives and sickly children, toiling daily, not to give them
      luxuries,&mdash;not to supply them with what may alleviate weariness or
      distract suffering, but bare sustenance,&mdash;coarse diet and coarser
      dress! Ah, my dear Martin, that Romanist plan of fasting one day in the
      week would n't be a bad institution were we to introduce it into our
      social code. If you and I could have, every now and then, our feelings of
      privation, just to teach us what others experience all the week through,
      we 'd have, if not more sympathy with narrow fortune, at least more
      thankfulness for its opposite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her Ladyship begs you will read this note, sir," said a servant,
      presenting an open letter to Martin. He took it, and having perused it,
      handed it to Repton, who slowly read the following lines:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "'The Lodge, Tuesday.

     "'Madam,&mdash;I have his Excellency's commands to inquire on
     what day it will suit Mr. Martin and your Ladyship to favor
     him with your company at dinner? His Excellency would
     himself say Saturday, but any intermediate day more
     convenient to yourself will be equally agreeable to him.

     "'I have the honor to remain, madam,

     "'With every consideration, yours,

     "'Lawrence Belcour, A.D.C.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      "'With every consideration'!" repeated Repton. "Confound the puppy, and
      his Frenchified phraseology! Why is he not, as he ought to be, your
      obedient servant?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a somewhat cold and formal invitation," said Martin, slowly. "I 'll
      just see what she thinks of it;" and he arose and left the room. His
      absence was fully of twenty minutes' duration, and when he did return his
      face betokened agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's more of it, Repton," said he, filling and drinking off his glass.
      "It 's all <i>my</i> fault, it seems. I ought to have gone out to the
      'Lodge' this morning, or called on somebody, or done something; in fact, I
      have been remiss, neglectful, deficient in proper respect&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that you decline the invitation?" broke in Repton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit of it; we 're to accept it, man. That's what I cannot
      comprehend. We are offended, almost outraged, but still we're to submit.
      Ah, Repton, I'll be really rejoiced when we leave this,&mdash;get away
      from all these petty annoyances and small intriguings, and live amongst
      strangers!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most patriotically spoken; but I'm not surprised at what you say. Have
      you made any resolve as to whither you mean to go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; we have so many plans, that the chances are we take none of them. I
      'm told&mdash;I know nothing of it myself&mdash;but I 'm told that we
      shall easily find&mdash;and in any part of the Continent&mdash;the few
      requirements we want; which are, an admirable climate, great cheapness,
      and excellent society."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a slight twinkle in Martin's eye as he spoke, as if he were in
      reality relishing the absurdity of these expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it Kate Henderson who encouraged you to credit this flattering
      picture?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; these are my Lady's own experiences, derived from a residence there
      'when George the Third was King.' As to Kate, the girl is by no means
      deficient in common sense; she has the frivolity of a Frenchwoman, and
      that light, superficial tone foreign education imparts; but take my word
      for it, Repton, she has very fine faculties!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will take your word for it, Martin. I think you do her no more than
      justice," said the old lawyer, sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I 'll tell you another quality she possesses," said Martin, in a
      lower and more cautious tone, as though dreading to be overheard,&mdash;"she
      understands my Lady to perfection,&mdash;when to yield and when to oppose
      her. The girl has an instinct about it, and does it admirably; and there
      was poor dear Mary, with all her abilities, and she never could succeed in
      this! How strange, for nobody would think of comparing the two girls!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody!" dryly re-echoed Repton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean, of course, that nobody who knew the world could; for in all the
      glitter and show-off of fashionable acquirement, poor Molly is the
      inferior."
    </p>
    <p>
      Repton looked steadfastly at him for several seconds; he seemed as if
      deliberating within himself whether or not he'd undeceive him at once, or
      suffer him to dwell on an illusion so pleasant to believe. The latter
      feeling prevailed, and he merely nodded slowly, and passed the decanter
      across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Molly," continued Martin, with all the fluency of a weak man when he
      fancies he has got the better of an argument,&mdash;"Molly is her father
      all over. The same resolution, the same warmth of heart, and that
      readiness at an expedient which never failed poor Barry! What a clever
      fellow he was! If he <i>had</i> a fault, it was just being too clever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too speculative, too sanguine," interposed Repton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That, if you like to call it so,&mdash;the weakness of genius."
    </p>
    <p>
      Repton gave a long sigh, and crossing his arms, fell into a fit of musing,
      and so they both sat for a considerable time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harry is coming home, you said?" broke in Repton at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; he is tired of India,&mdash;tired of soldiering, I believe. If he
      can't manage an exchange into some regiment at home, I think he 'll sell
      out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove!" said the old lawyer, speaking to himself, but still aloud, "the
      world has taken a strange turn of late. The men that used to have dash and
      energy have become loungers and idlers, and the energy&mdash;the real
      energy of the nation&mdash;has centred in the women,&mdash;the women and
      the priests! If I'm not much mistaken, we shall see some rare specimens of
      enthusiasm erelong. Such elements as these will not slumber nor sleep!"
    </p>
    <p>
      While Martin was pondering over this speech, a servant entered to say that
      Mr. Crow was without, and begged to know if he might pay his respects.
      "Ay, by all means. Tell him to come in," said Martin. And the words were
      scarcely uttered when the artist made his appearance, in full dinner
      costume, and with a certain unsteadiness in his gait, and a restless look
      in his eyes, that indicated his having indulged freely, without, however,
      having passed the barrier of sobriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You heard of our arrival, then?" said Martin, after the other had paid
      his respects, and assumed a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir. It was mentioned to-day at dinner, and so I resolved that, when
      I could manage to step away, I'd just drop in and ask how her Ladyship and
      yourself were."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where did you dine, Crow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the Chief Secretary's, sir, in the Park," replied Crow, with a mixture
      of pride and bash fulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, indeed. Was your party a large one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There were fourteen of us, sir, but I only knew three or four of the
      number."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who were they, Crow?" said Repton, whose curiosity on all such topics
      was extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young Nelligan was one. Indeed, it was through him I was asked myself.
      Colonel Massingbred was good enough to come over and have a look at my
      Moses,&mdash;a favor I humbly hope you 'll do me, gentlemen, any spare
      morning; for it's a new conception altogether, and I make the light come
      out of the bulrushes, just as Caravaggio did with his Lazarus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind Lazarus, Crow, but tell us of this dinner. Who were the
      others?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir, there was Nelligan and me,&mdash;that's one; and Tom Magennis,&mdash;two&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our neighbor of Barnagheela?" exclaimed Martin, in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same, sir. I left him there at the port wine, and my word for it, but
      they 'll not get him away easily, though Father Rafferty will do his best&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And was the priest also of the party?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was, sir; and sat at the Colonel's left, and was treated with every
      honor and distinction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, Martin, am I a true prophet?&mdash;answer me that. Has Val Repton
      foretold the course of events we are entering upon, or has he not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But this is a regular outrage,&mdash;an open insult to us!" cried Martin.
      "Here is a leading member of the Government entertaining the very men who
      opposed and defeated us,&mdash;actually caressing the very party which
      they enlisted us to crush?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This game is within every child's comprehension!" said Repton. "If <i>you</i>,
      and men of your stamp and fortune, could have secured them a parliamentary
      majority, they 'd have preferred you. You 'd be pleasanter to deal with,
      less exacting, more gentlemanly in fact; but as you failed to do this,&mdash;as
      it was plain and clear you had not the people with you,&mdash;why, they
      've thrown you over without a scruple, and taken into their favor the men
      who can and will serve them. I don't mean to say that the bargain is a
      good one,&mdash;nay, I believe the price of such aid will be very costly;
      but what do they care? It is one of the blessings of a representative
      government that Tories have to pay Whig debts, and Whigs are heirs to Tory
      defalcations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were politics discussed at table?" asked Martin, half impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All manner of subjects. We had law, and the assizes, and the grand-jury
      lists, and who ought to be high sheriffs, and who not. And young
      Massingbred made a kind of a speech&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was he there also?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That he was; and did the honors of the foot of the table, and made it the
      pleasantest place too! The way he introduced a toast to the independent
      and enlightened electors of Oughterard was as neat a thing as ever I
      heard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The devil take the whole batch of them!" cried Martin. "To think that I
      've spent nearly three thousand pounds for such a set of scoundrels is
      past endurance. I 'll never set foot amongst them again; as long as I live
      I 'll never enter that town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father Neal's own words," cried Crow. "'We done with Martin forever,'
      said he. 'This election was his Waterloo. He may abdicate now!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that sentiment was listened to by the Chief Secretary?" exclaimed
      Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he wasn't deaf he couldn't help hearing it, for we all did; and when I
      ventured to observe that a country was never the better for losing the
      patrons of art, and the great families that could encourage a genius,
      young Massingbred, said, 'Give up Moses, Mr. Crow,&mdash;give up Moses,
      and paint Daniel O'Connell, and you 'll never want admirers and
      supporters!' And they drowned me in a roar of laughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish my Lady could only hear all this," said Rep ton, in a whisper to
      Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always provided that I were somewhere else!" answered Martin. "But to be
      serious, Repton, I 'll hold no intercourse with men who treat us in this
      fashion. It is absurd to suppose that the Secretary could receive at his
      table this rabble,&mdash;this herd of low, vulgar&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh&mdash;what!" broke in Crow, with an expression of such truly comic
      misery as made Repton shake with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't mean <i>you</i>, Crow&mdash;I never thought of including you in
      such company,&mdash;but if these be Colonel Massingbred's guests, I 'll
      swear that Godfrey Martin shall not be my Lord Reckington's!" And with
      this bold resolve, uttered in a voice and manner of very unusual firmness,
      Martin arose and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the whole, then, your party was a pleasant one?" said Repton, anxious
      to lead Crow into some further details of the late dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, indeed it was, and it was not," said the artist, hesitatingly. "It
      was like a picture with some fine bits in it,&mdash;a dash of rich color
      here and there,&mdash;but no keeping! no general effect! You understand? I
      myself took no share in the talk. I never understood it; but I could see
      that they who did were somehow at cross-purposes,&mdash;all standing in
      adverse lights,&mdash;if I may use the expression. Whenever the Colonel
      himself, or one of the 'swells' of the company, came out with a fine
      sentiment about regenerated Ireland, happy and prosperous, and so forth,
      Magennis was sure to break in with some violent denunciation of the
      infernal miscreants, as he called the landlords, or the greatest curse of
      the land,&mdash;the Law Church!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how did Father Neal behave?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With great decorum,&mdash;the very greatest. He moderated all Tom's
      violence, and repeatedly said that he accepted no participation in such
      illiberal opinions. 'We have grievances, it is true,' said he, 'but we
      live under a Government able and willing to redress them. It shall never
      be said of us that we were either impatient or intolerant.' 'With such
      support, no Government was ever weak!' said the Colonel, and they took
      wine together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was very pleasant to see!" said Repton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it was, sir," rejoined Crow, innocently; "and I thought to myself, if
      there was only an end of all their squabbling and fighting, they 'd have
      time to cultivate the arts and cherish men of genius,&mdash;if they had
      them!" added he, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father Neal, then, made a favorable impression, you 'd say?" asked
      Repton, half carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd say, very favorable,&mdash;very favorable, indeed. I remarked that he
      always spoke so freely, so liberally. Twice or thrice, too, he said, 'If
      the Papists do this, that, or t' other;' and when the Colonel asked
      whether the Catholics of Ireland submitted implicitly to Rome in all
      things, he laughed heartily, and said, 'About as much as we do to the Cham
      of Tartary!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I 'd like to examine our friend there before the Committee,' whispered
      an old gentleman at the Colonel's right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It was the very thing was passing through my own mind at the minute,'
      said the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's exactly the kind of thing we want,' said the old gentleman again,&mdash;'a
      bold, straightforward denial; something that would tell admirably with the
      House! Present me to your friend, Massingbred!' And then the Chief
      Secretary said, 'The Member for Strudeham&mdash;Mr. Crutch-ley&mdash;is
      very desirous of being known to you, Mr. Rafferty.' And there was great
      smiling, and bowing, and drinking wine together after that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin now re-entered the room, and taking his place at the table, sat for
      some minutes in moody silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Repton, "what does my Lady think of your tidings?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She says she does n't believe it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does n't believe that these people dined with Massingbred; that Crow saw
      them, heard them, dined with them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no,&mdash;not that," said Martin, gently, and laying his hand
      familiarly on Crow's arm. "Don't mistake me; nor don't let Repton play the
      lawyer with us, and pervert the evidence. Lady Dorothea can't believe that
      her distinguished relative, the Viceroy, would ever countenance this game;
      that&mdash;that&mdash;in fact, we're to dine there, Repton, and see for
      ourselves! Though," added he, after a brief pause, "what we are to see, or
      what we are to do when we 've seen it, I wish anybody would tell me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I 'll be that man!" said Repton, with a mock solemnity, and
      imitating the tone and manner of a judge delivering sentence. "You 'll go
      from this place to the Lodge, where you 'll be fed 'to the neck,' feasted
      and flattered, and all your good resolves and high purposes will be cut
      down, and your noble indignation buried within the precincts of your own
      hearts!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And, so saying, he arose from the table and extended his hand to take
      leave, with all the gravity of a solemn farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you could say a word to his Excellency about Moses," muttered Crow, as
      he was leaving the room, "it would be the making of me!" But Martin never
      heeded the appeal; perhaps he never heard it.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. DARKENING FORTUNES
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Martins had always lived a life of haughty estrangement from their
      neighbors; there were none of exactly their own rank and pretensions
      within miles of them, and they were too proud to acknowledge the
      acquaintance of a small squirearchy, which was all that the country around
      could boast. Notwithstanding all the isolation of their existence, their
      departure created a great void in the county, and their absence was
      sensibly felt by every class around. The very requirements of a large
      fortune suggest a species of life and vitality. The movement of servants,
      the passing and repassing of carriages, the necessary intercourse with
      market and post,&mdash;all impart a degree of bustle and movement,
      terribly contrasted by the unbroken stillness of a deserted mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Dorothea had determined that there should be no ambiguity as to the
      cause of their departure; she had given the most positive orders on this
      head to every department of the household. To teach an ungrateful people
      the sore consequences of their own ingratitude, the lesson should be read
      in everything: in the little villages thrown out of work, in the silent
      quarries, the closed schoolhouses, the model farm converted into
      grass-land, even to the grand entrance, now built up by a wall of coarse
      masonry, the haughty displeasure of the proud mistress revealed itself,
      all proclaiming the sentiment of a deep, unforgiving vengeance. She had
      tortured her ingenuity for details which should indicate her anger; nor
      was she satisfied if her displeasure should not find its way into every
      cabin and at every hearth. The small hamlet of Cro' Martin had possessed a
      dispensary. A hard-working, patient, and skilful man had passed many years
      of life there as the doctor, eking out the poor subsistence of that
      unfavored lot, and supporting a family by a life of dreary toil. From this
      her Ladyship's subscription&mdash;the half of all his salary&mdash;was now
      to be withdrawn. She thought "Cloves was grown negligent; it might be age,&mdash;if
      so, a younger man would be better; besides, if he could afford to dress
      his three daughters in the manner he did, he surely could not require her
      thirty pounds per annum." The servants, too, complained that he constantly
      mistook their complaints. In fact, judgment was recorded against Cloves,
      and there was none to recommend him to mercy!
    </p>
    <p>
      We have said that there was a little chapel within the bounds of the
      demesne; it occupied a corner of a ruin which once had formed Cro' Martin
      Abbey, and now served for the village church. It was very small, but still
      large enough for its little congregation. The vicar of this humble
      benefice was a very old man, a widower, and childless, though once the
      father of a numerous family. Dr. Leslie had, some eighteen years back,
      been unfortunate enough to incur her Ladyship's displeasure, and was
      consequently never invited to the castle, nor recognized in any way, save
      by the haughty salute that met him as he left the church. To save him,
      however, a long and tedious walk on Sundays, he was permitted to make use
      of a little private path to the church, which led through one of the
      shrubberies adjoining his own house,&mdash;a concession of the more
      consequence as he was too poor to keep a carriage of the humblest kind.
      This was now ordered to be closed up, the gate removed, and a wall to
      replace it. "The poor had got the habit of coming that way; it was never
      intended for their use, but they had usurped it. To-morrow or next day we
      should hear of its being claimed at law as a public right of passage. It
      was better to do the thing in time. In short, it must be 'closed.'" By
      some such reasoning as this Lady Dorothea persuaded herself to this
      course; and who should gainsay her? Oh, if men would employ but one tenth
      of all that casuistry by which they minister to their selfishness, in acts
      of benevolence and good feeling,&mdash;if they would only use a little
      sophistry, to induce them to do right,&mdash;what a world this might be!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Martin knew nothing of these decisions; overwhelmed by the vast
      changes on every side, almost crushed beneath the difficulties that
      surrounded her, her first few weeks passed over like a disturbed dream.
      Groups of idle, unemployed people saluted her in mournful silence as she
      passed the roads. Interrupted works, half-executed plans met her eye at
      every turn, and at every moment the same words rang in her ears&mdash;"Her
      Ladyship's orders"&mdash;as the explanation of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto her life had been one of unceasing exertion and toil; from early
      dawn to late night she had been employed; her fatigues, however, great as
      they were, had been always allied with power. What she willed she could
      execute. Means never failed her, no matter how costly the experiment, to
      carry out her plans, and difficulty gave only zest to every undertaking.
      There is nothing more captivating than this sense of uncontrolled ability
      for action, especially when exercised by one of a warm and enthusiastic
      nature. To feel herself the life and spring of every enterprise, to know
      that she suggested and carried out each plan, that her ingenuity devised,
      and her energy accomplished all the changes around her, was in itself a
      great fascination; and now suddenly she was to awake from all this, and
      find herself unoccupied and powerless. Willingly, without a regret, could
      she abdicate from all the pomp and splendor of a great household; she saw
      troops of servants depart, equipage sold, great apartments closed up
      without a pang! To come down to the small conditions of narrow fortune in
      her daily life cost her nothing, beyond a smile. It was odd, it was
      strange; but it was no more! Far otherwise, however, did she feel the
      circumstances of her impaired power. That hundreds of workmen were no
      longer at her bidding, that whole families no longer looked up to her for
      aid and comfort,&mdash;these were astounding facts, and came upon her with
      an actual shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For what am I left here?" cried she, passionately, to Henderson, as he
      met each suggestion she made by the one cold word, "Impossible." "Is it to
      see destitution that I cannot relieve,&mdash;witness want that I am
      powerless to alleviate? To what end or with what object do I remain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I canna say, miss," was the dry response.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it be to humiliate me by the spectacle of my own inefficiency, a day
      or a week will suffice for that; years could not teach me more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderson bowed what possibly might mean an acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't speak of the estate," cried she, earnestly; "but what 's to
      become of the people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Many o' them will emigrate, miss, I've no doubt," said he, "when they see
      there 's nothing to bide for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You take it easily, sir. You see little hardships in men having to leave
      home and country; but I tell you that home may be poor and country cruel,
      and yet both very hard to part with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That 's vara true, miss," was the dry response.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For anything there is now to be done here, you, sir, are to the full as
      competent as I am. I ask again, To what end am I here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Giving to her question a very different significance from what she
      intended, Henderson calmly said, "I thought, miss, it was just yer ain
      wish, and for no other reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary's cheek became crimson, and her eyes flashed with angry indignation;
      but repressing the passion that was bursting within her, she walked
      hastily up and down the room in silence. At length, opening a large
      colored map of the estate which lay on the table, she stood attentively
      considering it for some time. "The works at Carrigulone are stopped?" said
      she, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the planting at Kyle's Wood?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And even the thinning there,&mdash;is that stopped?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, miss; the bark is to be sold, and a' the produce of the wood for ten
      years, to a contractor, a certain Mister&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want his name, sir. What of the marble quarries?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lady thinks they're nae worth a' they cost, and won't hear o' their
      being worked again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is the harbor at Kilkieran to be given up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, miss, and the Osprey's Nest will be let. I think they 'll mak' an
      inn or a public o' it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if the harbor is abandoned, what is to become of the fishermen? The
      old quay is useless."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vara true, miss; but there's a company goin' to take the royalties o' the
      coast the whole way to Belmullet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Scotch company, Mr. Henderson?" said Mary, with a sly malice in her
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, miss," said he, coloring slightly. "The house of M'Grotty and Co. is
      at the head o' it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And are they the same enterprising people who have proposed to take the
      demesne on lease, provided the gardens be measured in as arable land?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are, miss; they've signed the rough draught o' the lease this
      morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" cried she, growing suddenly pale as death. "Are there any other
      changes you can mention to me, since in the few days I have been ill so
      much has occurred?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There 's nae muckle more to speak o', miss. James M'Grotty&mdash;he's the
      younger brother&mdash;was here yesterday to try and see you about the
      school. He wants the house for his steward; but if you object, he 'll just
      take the doctor's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why&mdash;where is Dr. Cloves to go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He does na ken exactly, miss. He thinks he 'll try Auckland, or some of
      these new places in New Zealand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the dispensary must be continued; the people cannot be left without
      medical advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. James says he 'll think aboot it when he comes over in summer. He's a
      vara spirited young man, and when there's a meetin'-house built in the
      village&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough of this, Henderson. Come over here tomorrow, for I 'm not strong
      enough to hear more to-day, and let Mr. Scanlan know that I wish to see
      him this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mary motioned with her hand that he should withdraw. Scarcely was the
      door closed behind him than she burst into a torrent of tears; her long
      pent-up agony utterly overpowered her, and she cried with all the
      vehemence of a child's grief. Her heart once opened to sorrow, by a
      hundred channels came tributaries to her affliction. Up to that moment her
      uncle's departure had never seemed a cruelty; now it took all the form of
      desertion. The bitterness of her forlorn condition had never struck her
      till it came associated with all the sorrows of others. It is not
      impossible that wounded self-love entered into her feelings. It is by no
      means unlikely that the sense of her own impaired importance added
      poignancy to her misery. Who shall anatomize motives, or who shall be
      skilful enough to trace the springs of one human emotion? There was
      assuredly enough outside of and above all personal consideration to
      ennoble her grief and dignify her affliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first impulses led her to regard herself as utterly useless; her
      occupation gone, and her whole career of duty annihilated. A second and a
      better resolve whispered to her that she was more than ever needful to
      those who without her would be left without a friend. "If I desert them,
      who is to remain?" asked she. "It is true I am no more able to set in
      motion the schemes by which their indigence was alleviated. I am
      powerless, but not all worthless. I can still be their nurse, their
      comforter, their schoolmistress. My very example may teach them how
      altered fortune can be borne with fortitude and patience. They shall see
      me reduced to a thousand privations, and perhaps even this may bear its
      lesson." Drying her tears, she began to feel within her some of the
      courage she hoped to inspire in others; and anxious not to let old Catty
      detect the trace of sorrow in her features, issued forth into the wood for
      a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the deep shadows thickened around her, she grew calmer and more
      meditative. The solemn stillness of the place, the deep, unbroken
      quietude, imparted its own soothing influence to her thoughts; and as she
      went, her heart beat freer, and her elastic temperament again arose to
      cheer and sustain her. To confront the future boldly and well, it was
      necessary that she should utterly forget the past. She could no longer
      play the great part to which wealth and high station had raised her; she
      must now descend to that humbler one,&mdash;all whose influence should be
      derived from acts of kindness and words of comfort, unaided by the greater
      benefits she had once dispensed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The means placed at her disposal for her own expenditure had been
      exceedingly limited. It was her own desire they should be so, and Lady
      Dorothea had made no opposition to her wishes. Beyond this she had
      nothing, save a sum of five thousand pounds payable at her uncle's death.
      By strictest economy&mdash;privation, indeed&mdash;she thought that she
      could save about a hundred pounds a year of this small income; but to do
      so would require the sale of both her horses, retaining only the pony and
      the little carriage, while her dress should be of the very simplest and
      plainest. In what way she should best employ this sum was to be for after
      consideration. The first thought was how to effect the saving without
      giving to the act any unnecessary notoriety. She felt that her greatest
      difficulty would be old Catty Broon. The venerable housekeeper had all her
      life regarded her with an affection that was little short of worship. It
      was not alone the winning graces of Mary's manner, nor the attractive
      charms of her appearance that had so captivated old Catty; but that the
      young girl, to her eyes, represented the great family whose name she bore,
      and represented them so worthily. The title of the Princess, by which the
      Country people knew her, seemed her just and rightful designation. Mary
      realized to her the proud scion of a proud stock, who had ruled over a
      territory rather than a mere estate; how, then, could she bear to behold
      her in all the straits and difficulties of a reduced condition? There
      seemed but one way to effect this, which was to give her new mode of life
      the character of a caprice. "I must make old Catty believe it is one of my
      wild and wilful fancies,&mdash;a sudden whim,&mdash;out of which a little
      time will doubtless rally me. She is the last in the world to limit me in
      the indulgence of a momentary notion; she will, therefore, concede
      everything to my humor, patiently awaiting the time when it shall assume a
      course the very opposite."
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one should, however, be intrusted with her secret,&mdash;without some
      assistance it could not be carried into execution; and who should that be?
      Alas, her choice was a very narrow one. It lay between Scanlan and
      Henderson. The crafty attorney was not, indeed, much to Mary's liking. His
      flippant vulgarity and pretension were qualities she could ill brook; but
      she had known him do kind things. She had seen him on more than one
      occasion temper the sharpness of some of her Ladyship's ukases, little
      suspecting, indeed, how far the possible impression upon herself was the
      motive that so guided him; she had, therefore, no difficulty in preferring
      him to the steward, whose very accent and manner were enough to render him
      hateful to her. Scanlan, besides, would necessarily have a great deal in
      his power; he would be able to make many a concession to the poor people
      on the estate, retard the cruel progress of the law, or give them time to
      provide against its demands. Mary felt that she was in a position to
      exercise a certain influence over him; and, conscious of the goodness of
      the cause she would promote, never hesitated as to the means of employing
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who shall say, too, that she had not noticed the deferential admiration by
      which he always distinguished her? for there is a species of coquetry that
      takes pleasure in a conquest where the profits of victory would be
      thoroughly despised. We are not bold enough to say that such feelings
      found their place in Mary's heart. We must leave its analysis to wiser and
      more cunning anatomists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Straying onwards ever in deep thought, and not remarking whither, she was
      suddenly struck by the noise of masonry,&mdash;strange sounds in a spot
      thus lonely and remote; and now walking quickly onward, she found herself
      on the path by which the vicar on Sundays approached the church; and here,
      at a little distance, descried workmen employed in walling up the little
      gateway of the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By whose orders is this done?" cried Mary, to whose quick intelligence
      the act revealed its whole meaning and motive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Henderson, miss," replied one of the men. "He said we were to work
      all night at it, if we could n't be sure of getting it done before
      Sunday."
    </p>
    <p>
      A burst of passionate indignation rose to her lips, but she turned away
      without a word, and re-entered the wood in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," cried she, to herself, "it is, indeed, a new existence is opening
      before me; let me strive so to control my temper, that I may view it
      calmly and dispassionately, so that others may not suffer from the changes
      in my fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      She no sooner reached the house than she despatched a note to Mr. Scanlan,
      requesting to see him as early as possible on the following morning. This
      done, she set herself to devise her plans for the future,&mdash;speculations,
      it must be owned, to which her own hopeful temperament gave a coloring
      that a colder spirit and more calculating mind had never bestowed on them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. HOW MR. SCANLAN GIVES SCOPE TO A GENEROUS IMPULSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is a remark of Wieland's, that although the life of man is measured by
      the term of fourscore years and ten, yet that his ideal existence or, as
      he calls it, his "unacted life," meaning thereby his period of dreamy,
      projective, and forecasting existence, would occupy a far wider space. And
      he goes on to say that it is in this same imaginative longevity men differ
      the most from each other, the poet standing to the ungifted peasant in the
      ratio of centuries to years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Maurice Scanlan would not appear a favorable subject by which to test
      this theory. If not endowed with any of the higher and greater qualities
      of intellect, he was equally removed from any deficiency on that score.
      The world called him "a clever fellow," and the world is rarely in fault
      in such judgments. Where there is a question of the creative faculties,
      where it is the divine essence itself is the matter of decision, the world
      will occasionally be betrayed into mistakes, as fashion and a passing
      enthusiasm may mislead it; but where it is the practical and the real, the
      exercise of gifts by which men make themselves rich and powerful, then the
      world makes no blunders. She knows them as a mother knows her children.
      They are indeed the "World's own."
    </p>
    <p>
      We have come to these speculations by contemplating Mr. Scanlan as he sat
      with Mary Martin's open letter before him. The note was couched in polite
      terms, requesting Mr. Scanlan to favor the writer with a visit at his
      earliest convenience, if possible early on the following morning. Had it
      been a document of suspected authenticity, a forged acceptance, an
      interpolated article in a deed, a newly discovered codicil to a will, he
      could not have canvassed every syllable, scrutinized every letter, with
      more searching zeal. It was hurriedly written; there was, therefore, some
      emergency. It began, "Dear sir," a style she had never employed before;
      the letter "D" was blotted, and seemed to have been originally destined
      for an "M," as though she had commenced "Miss Martin requests," etc., and
      then suddenly adopted the more familiar address. The tone of command by
      which he was habitually summoned to Cro' Martin was assuredly not there,
      and Maurice was not the man to undervalue the smallest particle of
      evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has need of me," cried he to himself; "she sees everything in a state
      of subversion and chaos around her, and looks to me as the man to restore
      order. The people are entreating her to stay law proceedings, to give them
      time, to employ them; the poorest are all importuning her with stories of
      their sufferings. She is powerless, and, what's worse, she does not know
      what it is to be powerless to help them. She'll struggle and fret and
      scheme, and plan fifty things, and when she has failed in them all, fall
      back upon Maurice Scanlan for advice and counsel."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a grave question with Scanlan how far he would suffer her
      persecutions to proceed before he would come to her aid. "If I bring my
      succor too early, she may never believe the emergency was critical; if I
      delay it too long, she may abandon the field in despair, and set off to
      join her uncle." These were the two propositions which he placed before
      himself for consideration. It was a case for very delicate management,
      great skill, and great patience, but it was well worth all the cost. "If I
      succeed," said he to himself, "I'm a made man. Mary Martin Mrs. Scanlan, I
      'm the agent for the whole estate, with Cro' Martin to live in, and all
      the property at my discretion. If I fail,&mdash;that is, if I fail without
      blundering,&mdash;I 'm just where I was. Well," thought he, as he drove
      into the demesne, "I never thought I'd have such a chance as this. All
      gone, and she alone here by herself: none to advise, not one even to keep
      her company! I'd have given a thousand pounds down just for this
      opportunity, without counting all the advantages I have in my power from
      my present position, for I can do what I like with the estate,&mdash;give
      leases or break them. It will be four months at least before old Repton
      comes down here, and in that time I'll have finished whatever I want to
      do. And now to begin the game." And with this he turned into the
      stable-yard, and descended from his gig. Many men would have been struck
      by the changed aspect of the place,&mdash;silence and desolation where
      before there were movement and bustle; but Scanlan only read in the
      altered appearances around the encouragement of his own ambitious hopes.
      The easy swagger in which the attorney indulged while moving about the
      stable-yard declined into a more becoming gait as he traversed the long
      corridors, and finally became actually respectful as he drew nigh the
      library, where he was informed Miss Martin awaited him, so powerful was
      the influence of old habit over the more vulgar instincts of his nature.
      He had intended to be very familiar and at his ease, and ere he turned the
      handle of the door his courage failed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is very kind of you, Mr. Scanlan," said she, advancing a few steps
      towards him as he entered. "You must have started early from home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At five, miss," said he, bowing deferentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And of course you have not breakfasted?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, then, I only took a cup of coffee. I was anxious to be early. I
      thought from your note that there might be something urgent."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary half smiled at the mingled air of bashfulness and gallantry in which
      he uttered these broken sentences; for without knowing it himself, while
      he began in some confusion, he attained a kind of confidence as he went
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor have I breakfasted, either," said she; "and I beg, therefore, you
      will join me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Scanlan's face actually glowed with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have many things to consult you upon with regard to the estate, and I
      am fully aware that there is nobody more competent to advise me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor more ready and willing, miss," said Maurice, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm perfectly certain of that, Mr. Scanlan. The confidence my uncle has
      always reposed in you assures me on that head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was n't I right about the borough, Miss Mary?" broke he in. "I told you
      how it would be, and that if you did n't make some sort of a compromise
      with the Liberal party&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me interrupt you, Mr. Scanlan, and once for all assure you that there
      is not one subject of all those which pertain to this county and its
      people which has so little interest for me as the local squabbles of
      party; and I 'm sure no success on either side is worth the broken
      friendships and estranged affections it leaves behind it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A beautiful sentiment, to which I respond with all my heart," rejoined
      Scanlan, with an energy that made her blush deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only meant to say, sir," added she, hastily, "that the borough and its
      politics need never be discussed between us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so, miss. We'll call on the next case," said Scanlan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My uncle's sudden departure, and a slight indisposition under which I
      have labored for a week or so, have thrown me so far in arrear of all
      knowledge of what has been done here, that I must first of all ask you,
      not how the estate is to be managed in future, but does it any longer
      belong to us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, miss?" cried Scanlan, in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean, sir, is it my uncle's determination to lease out everything,&mdash;even
      to the demesne around the Castle; to sell the timber and dispose of the
      royalties? If so, a mere residence here could have no object for <i>me</i>.
      It seems strange, Mr. Scanlan, that I should have to ask such a question.
      I own to you,&mdash;it is not without some sense of humiliation that I do
      so,&mdash;I believed, I fancied I had understood my uncle's intentions.
      Some of them he had even committed to writing, at my request; you shall
      see them yourself. The excitement and confusion of his departure,&mdash;the
      anxieties of leave-taking,&mdash;one thing or another, in short, gave me
      little time to seek his counsel as to many points I wished to know; and,
      in fact, I found myself suddenly alone before I was quite prepared for it,
      and then I fell ill,&mdash;a mere passing attack, but enough to unfit me
      for occupation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Breakfast is served, miss," said a maid-servant, at this conjuncture,
      opening a door into a small room, where the table was spread.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm quite ready, and so I hope is Mr. Scanlan," said Mary, leading the
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner seated at table than she proceeded to do the honors with an ease
      that plainly told that all the subject of her late discourse was to be
      left for the present in abeyance. In fact, the very tone of her voice was
      changed, as she chatted away carelessly about the borough people and their
      doings, what strangers had lately passed through the town, and the
      prospects of the coming season at Kilkieran.
    </p>
    <p>
      No theme could more readily have put Mr. Scanlan at his ease. He felt, or
      fancied he felt, himself at that degree of social elevation above the
      Oughterard people, which enabled him to talk with a species of
      compassionate jocularity of their little dinners and evening parties. He
      criticised toilet and manners and cookery, therefore, with much
      self-complacency,&mdash;far more than had he suspected that Mary Martin's
      amusement was more derived from the pretension of the speaker than the
      matter which he discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what I think you'll find hardest of all, Miss Martin," said he, at
      the close of a florid description of the borough customs. "You can have no
      society here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet I mean to try," said she, smiling; "at least, I have gone so far
      as to ask Mrs. Nelligan to come and dine with me on Monday or Tuesday
      next."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Nelligan dine at Cro' Martin!" exclaimed he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she will be good enough to come so far for so little!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She 'd go fifty miles on the same errand; and if I know old Dan himself,
      he 'll be a prouder man that day than when his son gained the gold medal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'm sure <i>I</i>, at least, am perfectly requited," said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But are you certain, Miss, that such people will suit you?" said Scanlan,
      half timidly. "They live in a very different style, and have other ways
      than yours. I say nothing against Mrs. Nelligan; indeed, she comes of a
      very respectable family; but sure she hasn't a thought nor an idea in
      common with Miss Martin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suspect you are wrong there, Mr. Scanlan. My impression is, that Mrs.
      Nelligan and I will find many topics to agree upon, and that we shall
      understand each other perfectly; and if, as you suppose, there may be
      certain things new and strange to me in <i>her</i> modes of thinking, I 'm
      equally sure she 'll have to conquer many prejudices with regard to <i>me</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid you'll be disappointed, miss!" was the sententious reply of
      Scanlan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then there's our vicar!" broke in Mary. "Mr. Leslie will, I hope, take
      pity on my solitude."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, I forgot him entirely. I don't think I ever saw him at Cro'
      Martin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I, either," said Mary; "but he may concede from a sense of kindness
      what he would decline to a mere point of etiquette. In a word, Mr.
      Scanlan," said she, after a pause, "all the troubles and misfortunes which
      we have lately gone through&mdash;even to the destitution of the old house
      here&mdash;have in a great measure had their origin in the studious
      ignorance in which we have lived of our neighbors. I don't wish to enter
      upon political topics, but I am sure that had we known the borough people,
      and they us,&mdash;had we been in the habit of mingling and associating
      together, however little,&mdash;had we interchanged the little civilities
      that are the charities of social life,&mdash;we 'd have paused, either of
      us, ere we gave pain to the other; we'd at least have made concessions on
      each side, and so softened down the asperities of party. More than half
      the enmities of the world are mere misconceptions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true!" said Scanlan, gravely. But his thoughts had gone on a very
      different errand from the theme in question, and were busily inquiring
      what effect all these changes might have upon his own prospects.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now for a matter of business," said Mary, rising and taking her place
      at another table. "I shall want your assistance, Mr. Scanlan. There is a
      small sum settled upon me, but not payable during my uncle's life. I wish
      to raise a certain amount of this, by way of loan,&mdash;say a thousand
      pounds. Will this be easily accomplished?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the amount of the settlement, miss?" said Scanlan, with more
      eagerness than was quite disinterested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five thousand pounds. There is the deed." And she pushed a parchment
      towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scanlan ran his practised eye rapidly over the document, and with the
      quick craft of his calling saw it was all correct. "One or even two
      thousand can be had upon this at once, miss. It 's charged upon Kelly's
      farm and the mills&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All I want to know is, that I can have this sum at my disposal, and very
      soon; at once, indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will next week suit you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly. And now to another point. These are the few memoranda my uncle
      left with me as to his wishes respecting the management of the estate. You
      will see that, although he desires a considerable diminution of the sum to
      be spent in wages, and a strict economy in all outlay, that he still never
      contemplated throwing the people out of employment. The quarries were to
      be worked as before,&mdash;the planting was to be continued,&mdash;the
      gardens and ornamental grounds, indeed, were to be conducted with less
      expense; but the harbor at Kilkieran and the new school-house at Ternagh
      were to be completed; and if money could be spared for it, he gave me
      leave to build a little hospital at the cross-roads, allowing forty pounds
      additional salary to Dr. Cloves for his attendance. These are the chief
      points; but you shall have the papers to read over at your leisure. We
      talked over many other matters; indeed, we chatted away till long after
      two o'clock the last night he was here, and I thought I understood
      perfectly all he wished. Almost his last words to me at parting were, 'As
      little change as possible, Molly. Let the poor people believe that I am
      still, where my heart is, under the roof of Cro' Martin!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The recollection of the moment brought the tears to her eyes, and she
      turned her head away in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said she, rallying, and speaking with renewed energy, "if what
      Henderson says be correct, something later must have been issued than all
      this; some directions which I have never seen,&mdash;not so much as heard
      of. He tells me of works to be stopped, people discharged, schoolhouses
      closed, tenants ejected; in fact, a whole catalogue of such changes as I
      never could have courage to see, much less carry through. I know my dear
      uncle well; he never would have imposed such a task upon me, nor have I
      the resources within me for such an undertaking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And have you received no letter from Mr. Martin, from Dublin?" asked
      Scanlan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "None,&mdash;not a line; a note from my aunt&mdash;indeed, not from my
      aunt, but by her orders, written by Kate Henderson&mdash;has reached me,
      in which, however, there is no allusion to the property or the place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet her Ladyship said that Mr. Martin would write to you himself, in
      the course of the week, fully and explicitly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To whom was this said, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To myself, miss; there is the letter." And Scanlan drew from his
      pocket-book a very voluminous epistle, in Kate Henderson's hand. "This
      contains the whole of her Ladyship's instructions. How all the works are
      to be stopped,&mdash;roads, woods, and quarries; the townlands of
      Carrigalone and Killybogue to be distrained; Kyle-a-Noe the same. If a
      tenant can be got for the demesne, it is to be let, with the shooting over
      the seven mountains, and the coast-fishing too. There's to be no more
      charges for schools, hospital, or dispensary after next November;
      everything is to be on the new plan, what they call 'Self-supporting.' I
      'd like to know what that means. In fact, miss, by the time one half the
      orders given in that same letter is carried out, there won't be such
      another scene of misery and confusion in all Ireland as the estate of Cro'
      Martin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this is sanctioned by my uncle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose we must conclude it is, for he says nothing to the contrary;
      and Mr. Repton writes me what he calls 'my instructions,' in a way that
      shows his own feeling of indignation about the whole business."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was silent; there was not a sentiment which could give pain that had
      not then its place in her heart. Commiseration, deep pity for the sorrows
      she was to witness unavailingly, wounded pride, insulted self-esteem,&mdash;all
      were there! And she turned away to hide the emotions which overcame her.
      For a moment the sense of self had the mastery, and she thought but of how
      she was to endure all this humiliation. "Am I," said she to her own heart,&mdash;"am
      I to be insulted by the rivalry of Scotch stewards and gardeners, to be
      thrust from my place of power by some low-born creature, not even of the
      soil, but an alien?&mdash;to live here bereft of influence, representing
      nothing save the decay of our fortunes?" The torrent of her passion ran
      full and deep, and her bosom heaved in the agony of the moment. And then
      as suddenly came the reaction. "How small a share is mine in all this
      suffering, and how miserably selfish are even my sorrows! It is of others
      I should think!&mdash;of those who must leave hearth and home to seek out
      a new resting-place,&mdash;of the poor, who are to be friendless,&mdash;of
      the suffering, to whom no comfort is to come,&mdash;of the old, who are to
      die in distant lands,&mdash;and the young, whose hearts are never to warm
      to the affections of a native country!"
    </p>
    <p>
      While affecting to arrange the papers in his pocket-book, Scanlan watched
      every passing shade of emotion in her face. Nor was it a study in which he
      was ignorant; the habits of his calling had made him a very subtle
      observer. Many a time had he framed his question to a witness by some
      passing expression of the features. More than once had he penetrated the
      heart through the eye! The elevation of sentiment had given its own
      character to her handsome face; and as she stood proudly erect, with arms
      folded on her breast, there was in her look and attitude all the calm
      dignity of an antique statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scanlan interpreted truthfully what passed within her, and rightly judged
      that no small sentiment of condolence or sympathy would be appropriate to
      the occasion. Nor was he altogether unprovided for the emergency. He had
      seen a king's counsel warm up a jury to the boiling-point, and heard him
      pour forth, with all the seeming vehemence of an honest conviction, the
      wildest rhapsodies about desecrated hearths and blackened roof-trees,&mdash;talk
      of the spoiler and the seducer,&mdash;and even shed a tear "over the widow
      and the orphan!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What say you to all this, sir?" cried she. "Have you any counsel to give
      me,&mdash;any advice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is just what I have not, miss," said he, despondingly; "and, indeed,
      it was uppermost in my heart this morning when I was writing my letter.
      What 's all I 'm suffering compared to what Miss Martin must feel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What letter do you allude to?" asked she, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A letter I wrote to Mr. Repton, miss," said he, with a deep sigh. "I told
      him plainly my mind about everything; and I said, 'If it 's for
      exterminating you are,&mdash;if you 're going to turn out families that
      were on the land for centuries, and drive away over the seas, God knows
      where, the poor people that thought the name of Martin a shield against
      all the hardships of life, all I have to say is, you must look elsewhere
      for help, since it is not Maurice Scanlan will aid you.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said all this, sir?" broke she in, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did, miss. I told him I 'd hold the under-agency till he named some one
      to succeed me; but that I 'd not put my hand to one act or deed to
      distress the tenants. It 's giving up," said I, "the best part of my means
      of support; it's surrendering what I reckoned on to make me independent.
      But a good conscience is better than money, miss; and if I must seek out a
      new country, I 'll go at least without the weight of a cruel wrong over
      me; and if I see one of our poor Western people beyond seas, I 'll not be
      ashamed to meet him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that was noble,&mdash;that was truly noble conduct!" cried she,
      grasping his hand in both her own. "How I thank you from my very heart for
      this magnanimity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I ever suspected you 'd have said the half of this, Miss Mary, the
      sacrifice would have been a cheap one, indeed. But, in truth, I never
      meant to tell it. I intended to have kept my own secret; for I knew if any
      one only imagined why it was I threw up the agency, matters would only be
      worse on the estate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you are right," said she, thoughtfully. "This was most considerate.
      Such a censure would augment every difficulty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I felt that, miss. What I said to myself was, 'My successor will neither
      know the place nor the people; he 'll be cruel where he ought to have
      mercy, and spare those that he ought to keep to their duty.' It isn't in a
      day nor a week that a man learns the habits of a large tenantry, nor was
      it without labor and pains that I acquired my present influence amongst
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite true," said she; but more as though following out her own
      reflections than hearing his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They 'll have <i>you</i>, however," said Scanlan,&mdash;"you, that are
      better to them than all the agents that ever breathed; and the very sight
      of you riding down amongst them will cheer their hearts in the darkest
      moments of life. I turned back the whole townland of Terry Valley. They
      were packing up to be off to America; but I told them, 'she 's not going,&mdash;she
      'll stay here, and never desert you.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor will <i>you</i> either, sir," cried Mary. "You will not desert them,
      nor desert <i>me</i>. Recall your letter!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not gone off to the post yet. I was waiting to see you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better still. Oh, Mr. Scanlan, bethink you how much yet may be done for
      these poor people, if we will but forget ourselves and what we think we
      owe to self-esteem. If <i>you</i> will have sacrifices to make, believe
      me, <i>I</i> shall not escape them also. It is nobler, too, and finer to
      remain here bereft of influence, stripped of all power, to share their
      sufferings and take part in their afflictions. Neither you nor I shall be
      to them what we have been; but still, let us not abandon them. Tell me
      this,&mdash;say that you will stay to counsel and advise me, to guide me
      where I need guidance, and give me all the benefit of your experience and
      your knowledge. Let it be a compact between us then; neither shall go
      while the other remains!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with difficulty Scanlan could restrain his delight at these words.
      How flattering to his present vanity,&mdash;how suggestive were they of
      the future! With all the solemnity of a vow he bound himself to stay; and
      Mary thanked him with the fervor of true gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there be few emotions so pleasurable as to be the object of
      acknowledged gratitude for real services, it may well be doubted whether
      the consciousness of not having merited this reward does not seriously
      detract from this enjoyment. There are men, however, so constituted that a
      successful scheme&mdash;no matter how unscrupulously achieved&mdash;is
      always a triumph, and who cherish their self-love even in degradation!
      Maurice Scanlan is before our reader, and whether he was one of this
      number it is not for us to say; enough if we record that when he cantered
      homeward on that day he sang many a snatch of a stray ballad, and none of
      them were sad ones.

      CHAPTER XXIX. A SUNDAY MORNING AT CRO' MARTIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nothing is further from our intention than to enter upon the long-vexed
      question as to the benefits of an Established Church for Ireland. Wiser
      heads than ours have discussed it polemically, politically, socially, and
      arithmetically; and there it is still, left to the judgment of each, as
      his religion, his party, or his prejudices sway him. There is one view of
      the subject, however, which no traveller in the country has ever failed to
      be struck by; which is, that these settlements of Protestantism, dotted
      through the land, are so many types of an advanced civilization,
      suggesting, even to those of a different faith, respect and veneration for
      the decorous observance of this Church, and the calm peace-fulness with
      which they keep the Sabbath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Priests may denounce and politicians declaim, but the Irish peasant,
      nurtured with all the prejudices of race and religion, never throws off
      his veneration for the little flock, who, like a brave garrison in a
      besieged land, hold manfully together round the banner of their Faith! How
      striking is this in remote parts of the country, where the reformed
      religion has made little progress, and its followers are few in number!
    </p>

      It was Sunday; the gates of Cro' Martin Park were open to admit all who
      might repair to the church. When the Martins were at home, Lady Dorothea
      used to give to these occasions somewhat of the state of a procession. The
      servants wore their dress liveries; two carriages were in waiting. She
      herself appeared in a toilet that might have graced a court chapel; and a
      formal ceremoniousness of speech and demeanor were ordained as the
      becoming recognition of the holy day. Trained to these observances by many
      a year, Mary could scarcely comprehend the strange sensation she felt as
      she walked along to church, unattended and alone. It was a bright day of
      early summer, with a soft wind stirring the leaves above, and rippling
      pleasantly the waters of the lake. The perfume of the new hay floated
      through the thin air, with the odor of the whitethorn and the
      meadow-sweet; the birds were singing merrily; and through this gay carol
      came the mellow sound of the little bell that summoned to prayer. There
      was a delicious sense of repose in the stillness around, telling how, amid
      the cares and contentions of life, its wealth seekings, and its petty
      schemes there came moments when the better instincts were the victors, and
      men, in all the diversities of their rank and station, could meet together
      to kneel at one altar, and unite in one supplication. As she went, little
      glimpses were caught by her of the distant country beyond the demesne; and
      over all there reigned the same tranquillity; the sound of voices, far
      away, adding to the effect, and making the silence more palpable. "How
      peaceful it is," thought she, "and how happy it might be! Could we but
      bridle our own passions, restrain our mean jealousies, and curb the evil
      promptings of our own hearts, what blessings might grow up amongst them!
      But for objects not worth the attaining,&mdash;ambitions of no value when
      won,&mdash;and my uncle might still be here, strolling along, perhaps,
      with me at this very moment, and with me drinking in this calm repose and
      soothing quietness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before her, at some little distance on the path, went the three daughters
      of the village doctor; and, though well and becomingly attired, there was
      nothing in their appearance to warrant the reproach Lady Dorothea had cast
      upon their style of dress. It was, indeed, scrupulously neat, but simple.
      The eldest was a girl of about sixteen, with all the gravity of manner and
      staid expression that belongs to those who stand in the light of mothers
      to younger sisters. The housekeeper of her father's little home, the
      manager of all within its humble household, his secretary, his companion,
      Ellen Cloves had acquired, while little more than a child, the patient and
      submissive temper that long worldly trial confers. They lived perfectly to
      themselves; between the society of the castle and that of the farmers
      around there was no intermediate territory, and thus they passed their
      lives in a little circle of home duties and affections, which made up all
      their world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Martin had often wished it in her power to show them some attentions;
      she was attracted by their gentle faces and their calm and happy demeanor.
      Had her aunt permitted, she would have frequently invited them to the
      castle, lent them books and music, and sought companionship in their
      intercourse. But Lady Dorothea would not have heard of such a project; her
      theory was that familiarity with the peasant was so far safe that his
      station was a safeguard against any undue intimacy; while your half-gentry
      were truly perilous, for if you condescended to civility with them, they
      invariably mistook it for a friendship. Dr. Cloves dined every
      Christmas-day at the great house; but so did Mr. Scanlan and all the other
      heads of departments. It was a very grand and solemn festival, where
      neither host nor guest was happy; each felt that it was but the
      acquaintance of an hour, and that with the moment of leave-taking came
      back all the cold reserve of the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning, Miss Cloves; good-day, Jane, and little Bessy," said Mary,
      as she overtook them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning to you, Miss Martin," said Ellen, blushing with surprise at
      seeing her alone and on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust the doctor is not ill? I don't see him with you," said Mary,
      anxious to relieve her momentary embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Papa has been sent for to Knocktiernan, Miss Martin. They 're afraid that
      a case of cholera has occurred there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May God forbid!" ejaculated Mary, with deep emotion; "we have great
      distress and poverty around us. I hope we may be spared this scourge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is what papa feared always," rejoined Ellen, gravely; "that want and
      destitution would bring on the malady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you heard who it is is ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simon Hanley, the carpenter, Miss Martin; he worked at the castle once&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes I remember him; he made me my first little garden-rake. Poor
      fellow! And he has a large family. Your father will, I trust, have seen
      him in time. Knocktiernan is but four miles of a good road."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Papa went by the Mills, Miss Martin, for shortness, for he was on foot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did he not ride?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has sold Bluebell,&mdash;the pony, I mean, Miss Martin."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary's face became crimson with a blush that seemed to burn through the
      forehead into her very brain, and she could only mutter,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm sorry I did n't know; my carriage and pony were in the stable. If I
      had but heard of this&mdash;" and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had now reached the entrance to the little churchyard, where the few
      members of the small flock lingered, awaiting the arrival of the
      clergyman. Amidst many a respectful salutation and gaze of affectionate
      interest, Mary walked to the end of the aisle, where, shrouded in heavy
      curtains, soft-cushioned and high-panelled, stood the castle pew.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be, indeed, hard for the rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
      The very appliances of his piety are the offshoots of his voluptuous
      habits; and that his heart should feel humble, his hassock must be of
      down! It was not often that the words of the pastor were heard within that
      solemn, small enclosure with the same reverent devotion. Mary was now
      alone there; her mind no longer distracted by the petty incidents of their
      coming, her proud station seemed to have vanished, and she felt herself
      but as one of an humble flock, supplicating and in sorrow!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Leslie had heard of the terrible visitation which menaced them, and
      made it the subject of his sermon. The fact of his own great age and fast
      declining strength gave a deeper meaning to all he said, and imparted to
      the faltering words of his benediction the solemnity of a farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a little fatigued to-day, doctor," said Mary, as he came out of
      church. "Will you allow me to offer you my arm?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Willingly, my dear Miss Mary. But this is not our road."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?&mdash;this is the path to the vicarage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They 've made some change, my dear; they 've altered the approach."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you came round by the avenue,&mdash;a distance of two miles?" cried
      she, deep crimson with shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And kept you all waiting; but not very long, I trust," said he, smiling
      benevolently. "But come, talk to me of yourself, and when I am to come and
      see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear Dr. Leslie, you must not think that I&mdash;that my uncle&mdash;"
      She stopped, and he pressed her hand gently, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not speak of it; do not give importance to things which are trifles,
      if we have but good temper to leave them so. Is to-morrow a free day with
      you; or when shall I hope to find you at leisure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear doctor, every day will be so in future; all my functions have
      ceased here. I am to be nothing in future."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had heard something of that, and I said to myself, 'Now will Mary
      Martin display her real character. No longer carried away by the mere
      enthusiasm of her great power and her high station, not exalted to herself
      by the flatteries around her, we shall see whether the sterling qualities
      of her nature will not supply higher and greater resources than all the
      credit at a banker's!' I never undervalued all you did here, Mary Martin;
      I saw your noble purpose, even in failures; but I always felt that to make
      these efforts react favorably on yourself, there should be something of
      sacrifice. To do good was a luxury to you; and it was a luxury very easy
      to purchase. You were rich, you were powerful; none controlled you. Your
      benefits were acknowledged with all the enthusiasm of peasant gratitude.
      Why should you not be beneficent? what other course of conduct could bring
      you one half the pleasure? For the future, it is from another source you
      must dispense wealth; but happily it is one which there is no exhausting,
      for the heart exercised to charity has boundless stores. Let these be your
      riches now. Go amongst the people; learn to know them,&mdash;rather their
      friend than their benefactor,&mdash;and believe me that all the gold you
      have scattered so generously will not have sown such seeds of goodness as
      the meek example of your own noble submission to altered fortune. There,
      my dear," said he, smiling, "I 'll say no more, lest you should tell me
      that I have preached half an hour already. And I may come to-morrow, you
      say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a happiness it will be for me to speak to you!" said Mary, ardently.
      "There are so many things I want to say,&mdash;so much on which I need
      advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm but little practised in the ways of the world," said he, with a
      gentle sigh, "but I have ever found great wisdom in an honest purpose; and
      then," added he, more warmly, "it is a fine philosophy that secures us
      against humiliation, even in defeat!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They now walked along for some time without speaking, when a sudden angle
      of the path brought them directly in front of the castle. They both halted
      suddenly, struck, as it were, by the aspect of the spacious and splendid
      structure, all silent and deserted. The doors were closed, the windows
      shuttered,&mdash;not a living creature moved about the precincts,&mdash;and
      the lone flagstaff on the tower unfurled no "banner to the breeze." Even
      the trimly kept parterres were beginning to show signs of neglect, and
      tangled flowers fell across the gravel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a lonely home for <i>her!</i>" muttered the old doctor to himself;
      then suddenly exclaimed, "Here comes some one in search of you, Miss
      Martin."
    </p>
    <p>
      And a servant approached and whispered a few words in her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, immediately," said she, in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      She entreated the old man to rest himself for a while ere he continued his
      walk homeward; but he declined, and with an affectionate farewell they
      parted,&mdash;he towards the vicarage, and she to re-enter the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no need to practise mystery with our reader; and he who had just
      arrived, and was eager to see Miss Martin, was only Maurice Scanlan! As
      little use is there also in denying the fact that Mary was much annoyed at
      his inopportune coming. She was in no mood of mind to meet either him or
      such topics as he would certainly discuss.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, she had, so to say, given him a permission to be admitted at all
      times, and there was no help for it!
    </p>
    <p>
      These same people that one "must see," are very terrible inflictions
      sometimes. They are ever present at the wrong time and the wrong place.
      They come in moments when their presence is a discord to all our thoughts;
      and what is to the full as bad, they don't know it,&mdash;or they will not
      know it. They have an awful amount of self-esteem, and fancy that they
      never can be but welcome. A type of this class was Maurice Scanlan. Thrust
      forward by the accidents of life into situations for which nothing in his
      own humble beginnings seemed to adapt him, he had, like all the other
      Maurice Scanlans of the world, taken to suppose that he was really a very
      necessary and important ingredient in all affairs. He found, too, that his
      small cunning served to guide him, where really able men's wisdom failed
      them,&mdash;for so it is, people won't take soundings when they think they
      can see the bottom; and, finally, he conceived a very high opinion of his
      faculties, and thought them equal to much higher purposes than they had
      ever been engaged in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since his last interview with Mary Martin, he had never ceased to
      congratulate himself on the glorious turn of his affairs. Though not
      over-sanguine about others, Maurice was always hopeful of himself. It is
      one of the characteristics of such men, and one of the greatest aids to
      their activity, this ever-present belief in themselves. To secure the good
      opinion he had already excited in his favor was now his great endeavor;
      and nothing could so effectually contribute to this, as to show an ardent
      zeal and devotion to her wishes. He had read somewhere of a certain envoy
      who had accomplished his mission ere it was believed he had set out; and
      he resolved to profit by the example. It was, then, in the full confidence
      of success, that he presented himself on this occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary received him calmly, almost coldly. His presence was not in harmony
      with any thought that occupied her, and she deemed the task of admitting
      him something like an infliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I drove over, Miss Mary," said he, rather disconcerted by her reserve,&mdash;"I
      drove over to-day, though I know you don't like business on a Sunday, just
      to say that I had completed that little matter you spoke of,&mdash;the
      money affair. I did n't sleep on it, but went to work at once; and though
      the papers won't be ready for some days, the cash is ready for you
      whenever you like to draw it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been very kind and very prompt, sir," said she, thankfully, but
      with a languor that showed she was not thinking of the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said five per cent," continued Scanlan, "and I made no objection; for,
      to tell you the truth, I expected he'd have asked us six,&mdash;he's
      generally a hard hand to deal with."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that he hoped her curiosity might have inquired the name of
      him thus alluded to; but she never did so, but heard the fact with a calm
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scanlan was uneasy; his heaviest artillery had opened no breach. What
      should be his next manouvre?
    </p>
    <p>
      "The money-market is tight just now," said he, speaking only to gain time
      for further observation; "and there's worse times even before us."
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mary heard, she did not notice this gloomy speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm sure it will be no easy job to get the last November rent paid up.
      It was a bad crop; and now there 's sickness coming amongst them," said
      he, half as though to himself. "You'll have to excuse me to-day, Mr.
      Scanlan," said she, at last. "I find I can think of nothing; I am in one
      of my idle moods."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure, why not, Miss Mary?" said he, evidently piqued at the
      ill-success of all his zeal. "It was <i>I</i> made a mistake. I fancied,
      somehow, you were anxious about this little matter; but another day will
      do as well,&mdash;whenever it's your own convenience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are always considerate, always good-natured, Mr. Scanlan," said she,
      with a vagueness that showed she was scarcely conscious of what she
      uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If <i>you</i> think so, Miss Mary, I 'm well repaid," said he, with a
      dash of gallantry in the tone; "nor is it by a trifle like this I'd like
      to show my&mdash;my&mdash;my&mdash;devotion." And the last word came out
      with an effort that made his face crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," muttered she, not hearing one word of his speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that I'll come over to-morrow, Miss Mary," broke he in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, to-morrow!" replied she, as still musing she turned to the
      window, no more thinking of the luckless attorney than if he had been
      miles away; and when at length she did look round, he was gone! It was
      some minutes ere Mary could perfectly reconcile herself to the fact that
      he had been there at all; but as to how and when and why he took his
      leave, were mysteries of which she could make nothing. And yet Mr. Scanlan
      had gone through a very ceremonious farewell. He had bowed, and sidled,
      and simpered, and smirked, and sighed; had thrown himself into attitudes
      pictorially devoted and despairing, looked unutterable things in various
      styles, and finally made an exit, covered with as much shame and
      discomfiture as so confident a spirit could well experience, muttering, as
      he paced the corridor, certain prospective reprisals for this haughty
      indifference, when a certain time should arrive, and a certain fair lady&mdash;But
      we have no right to push his speculations further than he himself indulged
      them; and on the present occasion Maurice was less sanguine than his wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fed the mare, sir," said Barnes, as he held the stirrup for Scanlan to
      mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And gave her water, too," said the attorney, doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Devil a drop, then," resumed the other. "I just sprinkled the oats, no
      more; that's Miss Mary's orders always."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She understands a stable well," said Scanlan, half questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does n't she?" said the other, with a sententious smack of the lip. "To
      bit a horse or to back him, to tache him his paces and cure him of bad
      tricks, to train him for harness, double and single, to show him the way
      over a wall or a wide ditch, to make him rise light and come down easy,
      she has n't a match on this island; and as for training," added he, with
      fresh breath, "did you see Sir Lucius?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Scanlan, with awakened interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait till I bring him out, then. I'll show you a picture!" And Barnes
      disappeared into the stable. In five minutes after, he returned, leading a
      dark brown horse, who, even shrouded in all the covering of hood and
      body-clothes, displayed in his long step and lounging gait the attributes
      of a racer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes Barnes had unbuckled strap and surcingle, and sweeping
      back the blankets dexterously over the croup, so as not to ruffle a hair
      of the glossy coat, exhibited an animal of surpassing symmetry, in all the
      pride of high condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a beast," said he, proudly, "without speck or spot, brand or
      blemish about him! You 're a good judge of a horse, Mr. Scanlan; and tell
      me when did you see his equal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a nice horse!" said Scanlan, slowly, giving to each word a slow and
      solemn significance; then, casting a keen glance all around and over him,
      added, "There 's a splint on the off leg!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So there is, the least taste in life," said Barnes, passing his hand
      lightly over it; "and was there ever a horse&mdash;worth the name of a
      horse&mdash;that hadn't a splint? Sure, they 're foaled with them! I
      wanted Miss Mary to let me take that off with an ointment I have, but she
      would n't. 'It's not in the way of the tendon,' says she. 'It will never
      spoil his action, and we 'll not blemish him with a mark.' Them's her very
      words."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a nice horse," said Scanlan, once more, as if the very parsimony of
      the praise was the highest testimony of the utterer; "and in rare
      condition, too," added he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the very highest," said Barnes. "He was as sure of that cup as I am
      that my name 's Tim."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What cup?" asked Scanlan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kiltimmon,&mdash;the June race; he's entered and all; and now he's to be
      sold,&mdash;them 's the orders I got yesterday; he's to be auctioned at
      Dycer's on Saturday for whatever he'll bring!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, what do you expect for him, Barnes?" said Maurice,
      confidentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorrow one o' me knows. He might go for fifty,&mdash;he might go for two
      hundred and fifty! and cheap he'd be of it. He has racing speed over a
      flat course, and steeplechase action for his fences. With eleven stone on
      his back&mdash;one that can ride, I mean, of course&mdash;he 'd challenge
      all Ireland."

    <p>
      "I would n't mind making a bid for him myself," said Scanlan, hesitating
      between his jockeyism and the far deeper game which he was playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do then, sir, and don't draw him for the race, for he 'll win it as sure
      as I 'm here. 'T is Jemmy was to ride him; and Miss Mary would n't object
      to give you the boy, jacket and all, her own colors,&mdash;blue, with
      white sleeves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think so, Barnes? Do you think she'd let me run him in the Martin
      colors?" cried Scanlan, to whom the project now had suddenly assumed a
      most fascinating aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you give for him?" asked Barnes, in a business-like voice.

      "Leave it to me, sir,&mdash;leave it all to <i>me</i>," said Barnes, with

      slowly re-entered the stable; while Scanlan, putting spurs to his nag,
      dashed hurriedly away, his thoughts outstripping in their speed the pace
      he went, and traversing space with a rapidity that neither "blood" nor
      training ever vied with.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
