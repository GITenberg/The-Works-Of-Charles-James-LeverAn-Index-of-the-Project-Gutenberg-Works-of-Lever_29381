CHAPTER I. MR. HERMAN MERL
</h2>
<p>
This much-abused world of ours, railed at by divines, sneered down by
cynics, slighted by philosophers, has still some marvellously pleasant
things about it, amongst which, first and foremost, <i>facile princeps</i>,
is Paris! In every other city of Europe there is a life to be learned and
acquired just like a new language. You have to gain the acquaintance of
certain people, obtain admission to certain houses, submit yourself to
ways, habits, hours, all peculiar to the locality, and conform to usages
in which&mdash;at first, at least&mdash;you rarely find anything beyond
penalties on your time and your patience. But Paris demands no such
sacrifices. To enjoy it, no apprenticeship is required. You become free of
the guild at the Porte St. Denis. By the time you reach the Boulevards you
have ceased to be a stranger. You enter the &ldquo;Frères&rdquo; at dinner hour like
an old habitué. The atmosphere of light, elastic gayety around you, the
tone of charming politeness that meets your commonest inquiry, the
courtesy bestowed upon your character as a foreigner, are all as
exhilarating in their own way as your sparkling glass of Moët, sipped in
the window, from which you look down on plashing fountains, laughing
children, and dark-eyed grisettes! The whole thing, in its bustle and
movement, its splendor, sunlight, gilded furniture, mirrors, and smart
toilettes, is a piece of natural magic, with this difference,&mdash;that
its effect is ever new, ever surprising!
</p>
<p>
Sad and sorrowful faces are, of course, to be met with, since grief has
its portion everywhere; but that air of languid indifference, that look of
wearied endurance, which we characterize by the classic term of &ldquo;boredom,&rdquo;
 is, indeed, a rare spectacle in this capital; and yet now at the window of
a splendid apartment in the Place Vendôme, listlessly looking down into
the square beneath, stood a young man, every line of whose features
conveyed this same expression. He had, although not really above
twenty-four or twenty-five, the appearance of one ten years older. On a
face of singular regularity, and decidedly handsome, dissipation had left
its indelible traces. The eyes were deep sunk, the cheeks colorless, and
around the angles of the mouth were those tell-tale circles which betray
the action of an oft-tried temper, and the spirit that has gone through
many a hard conflict. In figure he was very tall, and seemed more so in
the folds of a long dressing-gown of antique brocade, which reached to his
feet; a small, dark green skull-cap, with a heavy silver tassel, covered
one side of his head, and in his hand he held a handsome meerschaum,
which, half mechanically, he placed from time to time to his lips,
although its bowl was empty.
</p>
<p>
At a breakfast-table covered with all that could provoke appetite, sat a
figure as much unlike him as could be. He was under the middle size, and
slightly inclined to flesh, with a face which, but for some strange
resemblance to what one has seen in pictures by the older artists, would
have been unequivocally vulgar. The eyes were small, keen, and furtive;
the nose, slightly concave in its outline, expanded beneath into nostrils
wide and full; but the mouth, thick-lipped, sensual, and coarse, was more
distinctive than all, and showed that Mr. Herman Merl was a gentleman of
the Jewish persuasion,&mdash;a fact well corroborated by the splendor of a
very flashy silk waistcoat, and various studs, gold chain, rings, and
trinkets profusely scattered over his costume. And yet there was little of
what we commonly recognize as the Jew in the character of his face. The
eyes were not dark, the nose not aquiline; the hair, indeed, had the wavy
massiveness of the Hebrew race; but Mr. Merl was a &ldquo;Red Jew,&rdquo; and the Red
Jew, like the red partridge, is a species <i>per se</i>.
</p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0001" id="linkimage-0001">

</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/018.jpg" width="100%" alt="018 " />
</div>
<p>
There was an ostentatious pretension in the &ldquo;get up&rdquo; of this gentleman.
His moustache, his beard, his wrist-buttons, his shirt-studs, the camellia
in his coat,&mdash;all, even to the heels of his boots, had been made
studies, either to correct a natural defect, or show off what he fancied a
natural advantage. He seemed to have studied color like a painter, for his
dark brown frock was in true keeping with the tint of his skin; and yet,
despite these painstaking efforts, the man was indelibly, hopelessly
vulgar. Everything about him was imitation, but it was imitation that only
displayed its own shortcomings.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wonder how you can resist these oysters, Captain,&rdquo; said he, as he
daintily adjusted one of these delicacies on his fork; &ldquo;and the Chablis, I
assure you, is excellent.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I never eat breakfast,&rdquo; said the other, turning away from the window, and
pacing the room with slow and measured tread.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, you are forgetting all the speculations that used to amuse us on the
voyage,&mdash;the delicious little dinners we were to enjoy at the
‘Rocher,&rsquo; the tempting dejeuners at &lsquo;Véfour&rsquo;s.&rsquo; By Jove! how hungry you
used to make me, with your descriptions of the appetizing fare before us;
and here we have it now: Ardennes ham, fried in champagne; Ostend oysters,
salmi of quails with truffles&mdash;and such truffles! Won&rsquo;t that tempt
you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
But his friend paid no attention to the appeal, and walking again to the
window, looked out.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Those little drummers yonder have a busy day of it,&rdquo; said he, lazily;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s the fourth time they have had to beat the salute to Generals this
morning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is there anything going on, then?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
But he never deigned an answer, and resumed his walk.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d send away that hissing teakettle, it reminds me of a
steamboat,&rdquo; said the Captain, peevishly; &ldquo;that is, if you have done with
it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So it does,&rdquo; said the other, rising to ring the bell; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the same
discordant noise, and the&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo; But the rest of the
similitude would n&rsquo;t come, and Mr. Merl covered his retreat with the
process of lighting a cigar,&mdash;an invaluable expedient that had served
to aid many a more ready debater in like difficulty.
</p>
<p>
It would be a somewhat tedious, perhaps not a very profitable task, to
inquire how two men, so palpably dissimilar, had thus become what the
world calls friends. Enough if we say that Captain Martin,&mdash;the heir
of Cro&rsquo; Martin,&mdash;when returning from India on leave, passed some time
at the Cape, where, in the not very select society of the place, he met
Mr. Merl. Now Mr. Merl had been at Ceylon, where he had something to do
with a coffee plantation; and he had been at Benares, where opium
interested him; and now again, at the Cape, a question of wine had
probably some relation to his sojourn. In fact, he was a man travelling
about the world with abundance of leisure, a well-stocked purse, and what
our friends over the Strait would term an &ldquo;industrial spirit.&rdquo; Messes had
occasionally invited him to their tables. Men in society got the habit of
seeing him &ldquo;about,&rdquo; and he was in the enjoyment of that kind of tolerance
which made every man feel, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not <i>my</i> friend,&mdash;<i>I</i>
didn&rsquo;t introduce him; but he seems a good sort of fellow enough!&rdquo; And so
he was,&mdash;very good-tempered, very obliging, most liberal of his
cigars, his lodgings always open to loungers, with pale ale, and even iced
champagne, to be had |for asking. There was play, too; and although Merl
was a considerable winner, he managed never to incur the jealous enmity
that winning so often imposes. He was the most courteous of gamblers; he
never did a sharp thing; never enforced a strict rule upon a novice of the
game; tolerated every imaginable blunder of his partner with bland
equanimity; and, in a word, if this great globe of ours had been a
green-baize cloth, and all the men and women whist-players, Mr. Herman
Merl had been the first gentleman in it, and carried off &ldquo;all the honors&rdquo;
 in his own hand.
</p>
<p>
If he was highly skilled in every game, it was remarked of him that he
never proposed play himself, nor was he ever known to make a wager: he
always waited to be asked to make up a party, or to take or give the odds,
as the case might be. To a very shrewd observer, this might have savored a
little too much of a system; but shrewd observers are, after all, not the
current coin in the society of young men, and Merl&rsquo;s conduct was eminently
successful.
</p>
<p>
Merl suited Martin admirably. Martin was that species of man which, of all
others, is most assailable by flattery. A man of small accomplishments, he
sang a little, rode a little, played, drew, fenced, fished, shot&mdash;all,
a little&mdash;that is, somewhat better than others in general, and giving
him that dangerous kind of pre-eminence from which, though the tumble
never kills, it occurs often enough to bruise and humiliate. But, worse
than this, it shrouds its possessor in a triple mail of vanity, that makes
him the easy prey of all who minister to it.
</p>
<p>
We seldom consider how much locality influences our intimacies, and how
impossible it had been for us even to know in some places the people we
have made friends of in another. Harry Martin would as soon have thought
of proposing his valet at &ldquo;Brookes&rsquo;s,&rdquo; as walk down Bond Street with Mr.
Merl. Had he met him in London, every characteristic of the man would
there have stood out in all the strong glare of contrast, but at the Cape
it was different. Criticism would have been misplaced where all was
irregular, and the hundred little traits&mdash;any one of which would have
shocked him in England&mdash;were only smiled at as the eccentricities of
a &ldquo;good-natured poor fellow, who had no harm in him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Martin and Merl came to England in the same ship. It was a sudden thought
of Merl&rsquo;s, only conceived the evening before she sailed; but Martin had
lost a considerable sum at piquet to him on that night, and when signing
the acceptances for payment, since he had not the ready money, somewhat
peevishly remarked that it was hard he should not have his revenge.
Whereupon Merl, tossing off a bumper of champagne, and appearing to speak
under the influence of its stimulation, cried out, &ldquo;Hang me, Captain, if
you shall say that! I &lsquo;ll go and take my passage in the &lsquo;Elphinstone.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 And he did so, and he gave the Captain his revenge! But of all the
passions, there is not one less profitable to indulge in. They played
morning, noon, and night, through long days of sickening calm, through
dreary nights of storm and hurricane, and they scarcely lifted their heads
at the tidings that the Needles were in sight, nor even questioned the
pilot for news of England, when he boarded them in the Downs. Martin had
grown much older during that same voyage; his temper, too, usually imbued
with the easy indolence of his father&rsquo;s nature, had grown impatient and
fretful. A galling sense of inferiority to Merl poisoned every minute of
his life. He would not admit it; he rejected it, but back it came; and if
it did not enter into his heart, it stood there knocking,&mdash;knocking
for admission. Each time they sat down to play was a perfect duel to
Martin.
</p>
<p>
As for Merl, his well-schooled faculties never were ruffled nor excited.
The game had no power to fascinate <i>him</i>, its vicissitudes had
nothing new or surprising to him; intervals of ill-luck, days even of
dubious fortune might occur, but he knew he would win in the end, just as
he knew that though there might intervene periods of bad weather and
adverse winds, the good ship &ldquo;Elphinstone&rdquo; would arrive at last, and, a
day sooner or a day later, discharge passengers and freight on the banks
of the Thames.
</p>
<p>
You may forgive the man who has rivalled you in love, the banker whose
&ldquo;smash&rdquo; has engulfed all your fortune, the violent political antagonist
who has assailed you personally, and in the House, perhaps, answered the
best speech you ever made by a withering reply. You may extend feelings of
Christian charity to the reviewer who has &ldquo;slashed&rdquo; your new novel, the
lawyer whose vindictive eloquence has exposed, the artist in &ldquo;Punch&rdquo; who
has immortalized, you; but there is one man you never forgive, of whom you
will never believe one good thing, and to whom you would wish a thousand
evil ones,&mdash;he is your natural enemy, brought into the world to be
your bane, born that he may be your tormentor; and this is the man who <i>always</i>
beats you at play! Happily, good reader, you may have no feelings of the
gambler,&mdash;you may be of those to whom this fatal vice has never
appealed, or appealed in vain; but if you <i>have</i> &ldquo;played,&rdquo; or even
mixed with those who have, you could n&rsquo;t have failed to be struck with the
fact that there is that one certain man from whom you never win! Wherever
he is, there, too, is present your evil destiny! Now, there is no
pardoning this,&mdash;the double injury of insult to your skill and damage
to your pocket. Such a man as this becomes at last your master. You may
sneer at his manners, scoff at his abilities, ridicule his dress, laugh at
his vulgarity,&mdash;poor reprisals these! In his presence, the sense of
that one superiority he possesses over you makes you quail! In the stern
conflict, where your destiny and your capacity seem alike at issue, he
conquers you,&mdash;not to-day or to-morrow, but ever and always! There he
sits, arbiter of your fate,&mdash;only doubtful how long he may defer the
day of your sentence!
</p>
<p>
It is something in the vague indistinctness of this power&mdash;something
that seems to typify the agency of the Evil One himself&mdash;that at once
tortures and subdues you; and you ever hurry into fresh conflict with the
ever-present consciousness of fresh defeat! We might have spared our
reader this discursive essay, but that it pertains to our story. Such was
the precise feeling entertained by Martin towards Merl. He hated him with
all the concentration of his great hatred, and yet he could not
disembarrass himself of his presence. He was ashamed of the man amongst
his friends; he avoided him in all public places; he shrunk from his very
contact as though infected; but he could not throw off his acquaintance,
and he nourished in his heart a small ember of hope that one day or other
the scale of fortune would turn, and he might win back again all he had
ever lost, and stand free and unembarrassed as in the first hour he had
met him! Fifty times had he consulted Fortune, as it were, to ask if this
moment had yet arrived; but hitherto ever unsuccessfully,&mdash;Merl won
on as before. Martin, however, invariably ceased playing when he
discovered that his ill-luck continued. It was an experiment,&mdash;a mere
pilot balloon to Destiny; and when he saw the direction adverse, he did
not adventure on the grand ascent. It was impossible that a man of Merl&rsquo;s
temperament and training should not have detected this game. There was not
a phase of the gambler&rsquo;s mind with which he was not thoroughly familiar.
</p>
<p>
Close intimacies, popularly called friendships, have always their secret
motive, if we be but skilful enough to detect it. We see people associate
together of widely different habits, and dispositions the most opposite,
with nothing in common of station, rank, object, or pursuit. In such cases
the riddle has always its key, could we only find it.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Martin had been some weeks in Paris with his family, when a brief note
informed him that Merl had arrived there. He despatched an answer still
briefer, asking him to breakfast on the following morning; and it was in
the acceptance of this same invitation we have now seen him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s here just now?&rdquo; said Merl, throwing down his napkin, and pushing
his chair a little back from the table, while he disposed his short, fat
legs into what he fancied was a most graceful attitude.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here? Do you mean in Paris?&rdquo; rejoined Martin, pettishly,&mdash;for he
never suffered so painfully under this man&rsquo;s intimacy as when his manners
assumed the pretension of fashion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;of course,&mdash;I mean, who&rsquo;s in Paris?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There are, I believe, about forty-odd thousand of our countrymen and
countrywomen,&rdquo; said the other, half contemptuously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve no doubt; but my question took narrower bounds. I meant, who of
<i>our</i> set,&mdash;who of us?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Martin turned round, and fixing his eyes on him, scanned him from head to
foot with a gaze of such intense insolence as no words could have
equalled. For a while the Jew bore it admirably; but these efforts, after
all, are only like the brief intervals a man can live under water, and
where the initiated beats the inexperienced only by a matter of seconds.
As Martin continued his stare, Merl&rsquo;s cheek tingled, grew red, and finally
his whole face and forehead became scarlet.
</p>
<p>
With an instinct like that of a surgeon who feels he has gone deep enough
with his knife, Martin resumed his walk along the room without uttering a
word.
</p>
<p>
Merl opened the newspaper, and affected to read; his hand, however,
trembled, and his eyes wandered listlessly over the columns, and then
furtively were turned towards Martin as he paced the chamber in silence.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you think you can manage that little matter for me, Captain?&rdquo; said he
at last, and in a voice attuned to its very humblest key.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What little matter? Those two bills do you mean?&rdquo; said Martin, suddenly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not at all. I &lsquo;m not the least pressed for cash. I alluded to the Club;
you promised you &lsquo;d put me up, and get one of your popular friends to
second me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said Martin, evidently relieved from a momentary terror.
&ldquo;Lord Claude Willoughby or Sir Spencer Cavendish would be the men if we
could find them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lord Claude, I perceive, is here; the paper mentions his name in the
dinner company at the Embassy yesterday.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo; asked Martin, with an air of innocence that Merl well
comprehended as insult.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No. We &lsquo;ve met,&mdash;I think we &lsquo;ve played together; I remember once at
Baden&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lord Claude Willoughby, sir,&rdquo; said a servant, entering with a card,
&ldquo;desires to know if you &lsquo;re at home?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And won&rsquo;t be denied if you are not,&rdquo; said his Lordship, entering at the
same instant, and saluting Martin with great cordiality.

CHAPTER II. MR. MERL
</h2>
<p>
The French have invented a slang word for a quality that deserves a more
recognized epithet, and by the expression <i>chic</i> have designated a
certain property by which objects assert their undoubted superiority over
all their counterfeits. Thus, your coat from Nugee&rsquo;s, your carriage from
Leader&rsquo;s, your bracelet from Storr&rsquo;s, and your bonnet from Madame Palmyre,
have all their own peculiar <i>chic</i>, or, in other words, possess a
certain invisible, indescribable essence that stamps them as the best of
their kind, with an excellence unattainable by imitation, and a charm all
their own!
</p>
<p>
Of all the products in which this magical property insinuates itself,
there is not one to which it contributes so much as the man of fashion. He
is the very type of <i>chic</i>. To describe him you are driven to a
catalogue of negatives, and you only arrive at anything like a resemblance
by an enumeration of the different things he is not.
</p>
<p>
The gentleman who presented himself to Martin at the close of our last
chapter was in many respects a good specimen of his order. He had entered
the room, believing Martin to be there alone; but no sooner had he
perceived another, and that other one not known to him, than all the
buoyant gayety of his manner was suddenly toned down into a quiet
seriousness; while, taking his friend&rsquo;s arm, he said in a low voice,&mdash;&ldquo;If
you &lsquo;re busy, my dear Martin, don&rsquo;t hesitate for a moment about sending me
off; I had not the slightest suspicion there was any one with you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nor is there,&rdquo; said Martin, with a supercilious glance at Merl, who was
endeavoring in a dozen unsuccessful ways to seem unaware of the new
arrival&rsquo;s presence.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I want to introduce him to you,&rdquo; said Martin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no, my dear friend, on no account.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I must; there&rsquo;s no help for it,&rdquo; said Martin, impatiently, while he
whispered something eagerly in the other&rsquo;s ear.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, some other day; another time&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here and now, Claude,&rdquo; said Martin, peremptorily; while, without waiting
for reply, he said aloud, &ldquo;Merl, I wish to present you to Lord Claude
Willoughby,&mdash;Lord Claude, Mr. Herman Merl.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Merl bowed and smirked and writhed as his Lordship, with a bland smile and
a very slight bow, acknowledged the presentation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Had the pleasure of meeting your Lordship at Baden two summers ago,&rdquo; said
the Jew, with an air meant to be the ideal of fashionable ease.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was at Baden at the time you mention,&rdquo; said he, coldly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I used to watch your Lordship&rsquo;s game with great attention; you won
heavily, I think?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember, just now,&rdquo; said he, carelessly; not, indeed, that such
was the fact, or that he desired it should be thought so; he only wished
to mark his sense of what he deemed an impertinence.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The man who can win at rouge-et-noir can do anything, in my opinion,&rdquo;
 said Merl.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What odds are you taking on Rufus?&rdquo; said Martin to Willoughby, and
without paying the slightest attention to Merl&rsquo;s remark.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Eleven to one; but I&rsquo;ll not take it again. Hecuba is rising hourly, and
some say she &lsquo;ll be the favorite yet.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is Rufus your Lordship&rsquo;s horse?&rdquo; said the Jew, insinuatingly.
</p>
<p>
Willoughby bowed, and continued to write in his note-book.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you said the betting was eleven to one on the field, my Lord?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It ought to be fourteen to one, at least.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;ll give you fourteen to one, my Lord, just for the sake of a little
interest in the race.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Willoughby ceased writing, and looked at him steadfastly for a second or
two. &ldquo;I have not said that the odds were fourteen to one.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I understand you perfectly, my Lord; you merely thought that they would
be, or, at least, ought to be.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Merl wants a bet with you, in fact,&rdquo; said Martin, as he applied alight to
his meerschaum; &ldquo;and if you won&rsquo;t have him, I will.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What shall it be, sir,&rdquo; said Lord Claude, pencil in hand; &ldquo;in ponies&mdash;fifties?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, ponies, my Lord. I only meant it, just as I said, to give me
something to care for in the race.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will you put him up at the &lsquo;Cercle&rsquo; after that?&rdquo; whispered Martin, with a
look of sly malice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you when the match is over,&rdquo; said Willoughby, laughing; &ldquo;but if
I won&rsquo;t, here &lsquo;s one that will. That&rsquo;s a neat phaeton of Cavendish&rsquo;s.&rdquo; And
at the same instant Martin opened the window, and made a signal with his
handkerchief.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing for <i>you</i>, Merl,&rdquo; said Martin, pointing down to a
splendid pair of dark chestnuts harnessed to a handsome phaeton. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
worth five hundred pounds to any fellow starting an equipage to chance
upon one of Cavendish&rsquo;s. He has not only such consummate taste in carriage
and harness, but he makes his nags perfection.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He drives very neatly,&rdquo; said Willoughby.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What was it he gave for that near-side horse?&mdash;a thousand pounds, I
think.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Twelve hundred and fifty, and refused a hundred for my bargain,&rdquo; said a
very diminutive, shrewd-looking man of about five-and-thirty, who entered
the room with great affectation of juvenility. &ldquo;I bought him for a cab,
never expecting to &lsquo;see his like again,&rsquo; as Shakspeare says.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you offered the whole concern yesterday to Damre-mont for fifty
thousand francs?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, Harry, that&rsquo;s a mistake. I said I &lsquo;d play him a match at piquet,
whether he gave seventy thousand for the equipage or nothing. It was he
that proposed fifty thousand. Mine was a handsome offer, I think.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I call it a most munificent one,&rdquo; said Martin. &ldquo;By the way, you don&rsquo;t
know my friend here, Mr. Merl, Sir Spencer Cavendish.&rdquo; And the baronet
stuck his glass in his eye, and scanned the stranger as unscrupulously as
though he were a hack at Tattersairs.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where did he dig him up, Claude?&rdquo; whispered he, after a second.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;In India, I fancy; or at the Cape.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That fellow has something to do with the hell in St. James&rsquo;s Street; I
‘ll swear I know his face.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0002" id="linkimage-0002">

</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/029.jpg" width="100%" alt="029 " />
</div>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;ve been telling Merl that he &lsquo;s in rare luck to find such a turn-out
as that in the market; that is, if you still are disposed to sell.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;ll sell it; give him the tiger, boots, cockade, and all,&mdash;everything
except that Skye terrier. You shall have the whole, sir, for two thousand
pounds; or, if you prefer it&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A certain warning look from Lord Claude suddenly arrested his words, and
he added, after a moment,&mdash;&ldquo;But I &lsquo;d rather sell it off, and think no
more of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Try the nags; Sir Spencer, I&rsquo;m sure, will have no objection,&rdquo; said
Martin. But the baronet&rsquo;s face looked anything but concurrence with the
proposal.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Take them a turn round the Bois de Boulogne, Merl,&rdquo; said Martin, laughing
at his friend&rsquo;s distress.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And he may have the turn-out at his own price after the trial,&rdquo; muttered
Lord Claude, with a quiet smile.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Egad! I should think so,&rdquo; whispered Cavendish; &ldquo;for, assuredly, I should
never think of being seen in it again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If Sir Spencer Cavendish has no objection,&mdash;if he would permit his
groom to drive me just down the Boulevards and the Rue Rivoli&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The cool stare of the baronet did not permit him to finish. It was really
a look far more intelligible than common observers might have imagined,
for it conveyed something like recognition,&mdash;a faint approach to an
intimation that said, &ldquo;I &lsquo;m persuaded that we have met before.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that is the best plan. Let the groom have the ribbons,&rdquo; said Martin,
laughing with an almost schoolboy enjoyment of a trick. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t lose
time, Merl, for Sir Spencer would n&rsquo;t miss his drive in the Champs Elysees
for any consideration.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Gentlemen, I am your very humble and much obliged servant!&rdquo; said
Cavendish, as soon as Merl had quitted the room. &ldquo;If that distinguished
friend of yours should not buy my carriage&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But he will,&rdquo; broke in Martin; &ldquo;he must buy it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He ought, I think,&rdquo; said Lord Claude. &ldquo;If I were in his place, there&rsquo;s
only one condition I &lsquo;d stipulate for.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And that is&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That you should drive with him one day&mdash;one would be enough&mdash;from
the Barrière de l&lsquo;Étoile to the Louvre.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This is all very amusing, gentlemen, most entertaining,&rdquo; said Cavendish,
tartly; &ldquo;but who is he?&mdash;I don&rsquo;&rsquo;t mean that,&mdash;but what is he?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Martin&rsquo;s banker, I fancy,&rdquo; said Lord Claude.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Does he lend any sum from five hundred to twenty thousand on equitable
terms on approved personal security?&rdquo; said Cavendish, imitating the terms
of the advertisements.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He &lsquo;ll allow all he wins from you to remain in your hands at sixty per
cent interest, if he doesn&rsquo;t want cash!&rdquo; said Martin, angrily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, then, I &lsquo;m right. It is my little Moses of St. James&rsquo;s Street. He was
n&rsquo;t always as flourishing as we see him now. Oh dear, if any man, three
years back, had told me that this fellow would have proposed seating
himself in my phaeton for a drive round Paris, I don&rsquo;t believe&mdash;nay,
I &lsquo;m sure&mdash;my head couldn&rsquo;t have stood it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You know him, then?&rdquo; said Willoughby.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should think every man about town a dozen years ago must know him.
There was a kind of brood of these fellows; we used to call them Joseph
and his brethren. One sold cigars, another vended maraschino; this
discounted your bills, that took your plate or your horses&mdash;ay, or
your wardrobe&mdash;on a bill of sale, and handed you over two hundred
pounds to lose at his brother&rsquo;s hell in the evening. Most useful
scoundrels they were,&mdash;equally expert on &lsquo;Change and in the Coulisses
of the Opera!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will say this for him,&rdquo; said Martin, &ldquo;he &lsquo;s not a hard fellow to deal
with; he does not drive a bargain ungenerously.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your hangman is the tenderest fellow in the world,&rdquo; said Cavendish, &ldquo;till
the final moment. It&rsquo;s only in adjusting the last turn under the ear that
he shows himself &lsquo;ungenerous.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you deep with him, Harry?&rdquo; said Willoughby, who saw a sudden paleness
come over Martin&rsquo;s face.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Too deep!&rdquo; said he, with a bitter effort at a laugh,&mdash;&ldquo;a great deal
too deep.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We &lsquo;re all too deep with those fellows,&rdquo; said Cavendish, as, stretching
out his legs, he contemplated the shape and lustre of his admirably
fitting boots. &ldquo;One begins by some trumpery loan or so; thence you go on
to a play transaction or a betting-book with them, and you end&mdash;egad,
you end by having the fellow at dinner!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Martin wants his friend to be put up for the Club,&rdquo; said Willoughby.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Eh, what? At the &lsquo;Cercle,&rsquo; do you mean?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why not? Is it so very select?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, not exactly that; there are the due proportions of odd reputations,
half reputations, and no reputations; but remember, Martin, that however
black they be now, they all began white. When they started, at least, they
were gentlemen.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suspect that does not make the case much better.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; but it makes <i>ours</i> better, in associating with them. Come,
come, you know as well as any one that this is impossible, and that if you
should do it to-day, I should follow the lead to-morrow, and our Club
become only an asylum for unpayable tailors and unappeasable bootmakers!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You go too fast, sir,&rdquo; exclaimed Martin, in a tone of anger. &ldquo;I never
intended to pay my debts by a white ball in the ballot-box, nor do I think
that Mr. Merl would relinquish his claim on some thousand pounds, even for
the honor of being the club colleague of Sir Spencer Cavendish.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then I know him better,&rdquo; said the other, tapping his-boot with his cane;
&ldquo;he would, and he &lsquo;d think it a right good bargain besides. From seeing
these fellows at racecourses and betting-rooms, always cold, calm, and
impassive, never depressed by ill-luck, as little elated by good, we fall
into the mistake of esteeming them as a kind of philosophers in life,
without any of those detracting influences that make you and Willoughby,
and even myself, sometimes rash and headstrong. It is a mistake, though;
they have a weakness,&mdash;and a terrible weakness,&mdash;which is, their
passion to be thought in fashionable society. Yes, they can&rsquo;t resist that!
All their shrewd calculations, all their artful schemes, dissolve into
thin air, at the bare prospect of being recognized &lsquo;in society.&rsquo; I have
studied this flaw in them for many a year back. I &lsquo;ll not say I haven&rsquo;t
derived advantage from it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet you &lsquo;d refuse him admission into a club,&rdquo; cried Martin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Certainly. A club is a Democracy, where each man, once elected, is the
equal of his neighbor. Society is, on the other hand, an absolute
monarchy, where your rank flows from the fountain of honor,&mdash;the
host. Take him along with you to her Grace&rsquo;s &lsquo;tea,&rsquo; or my Lady&rsquo;s reception
this evening, and see if the manner of the mistress of the house does not
assign him his place, as certainly as if he were marshalled to it by a
lackey. All his mock tranquillity and assumed ease of manner will not be
proof against the icy dignity of a grande dame; but in the Club he&rsquo;s as
good as the best, or he&rsquo;ll think so, which comes to the same thing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Cavendish is right,&mdash;that is, as much so as he can be in anything,&rdquo;
 said Willoughby, laughing. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put him up, Martin.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then what am I to do? I have given a sort of a pledge. He is not easily
put off; he does not lightly relinquish an object.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Take him off the scent. Introduce him at the Embassy. Take him to the
Courcelles.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This is intolerable,&rdquo; broke in Martin, angrily. &ldquo;I ask for advice, and
you reply by a sneer and a mockery.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not at all. I never was more serious. But here he comes! Look only how
the fellow lolls back in the phaeton. Just see how contemptuously he looks
down on the foot-travellers. I&rsquo;d lay on another hundred for that stare;
for, assuredly, he has already made the purchase in his own mind.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, Merl, what do you say to Sir Spencer&rsquo;s taste in horseflesh?&rdquo; said
Martin, as he entered.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They &lsquo;re nice hacks; very smart.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nice hacks!&rdquo; broke in Cavendish, &ldquo;why, sir, they&rsquo;re both thoroughbred;
the near horse is by Tiger out of a Crescent mare, and the off one won the
Acton steeple-chase. When you said hacks, therefore, you made a cruel
blunder.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s what a friend of mine called them just now,&rdquo; said Merl; &ldquo;and
remarked, moreover, that the large horse had been slightly fired on the&mdash;the&mdash;I
forget the name he gave it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You probably remember your friend&rsquo;s name better,&rdquo; said Cavendish,
sneeringly. &ldquo;Who was he, pray?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Massingbred,&mdash;we call him Jack Massingbred; he&rsquo;s the Member for
somewhere in Ireland.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor Jack!&rdquo; muttered Cavendish, &ldquo;how hard up he must be!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But you like the equipage, Merl?&rdquo; said Martin, who had a secret suspicion
that it was now Cavendish&rsquo;s turn for a little humiliation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s neat. The buggy&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The buggy! By Jove, sir, you have a precious choice of epithets! Please
to let me inform you that full-blooded horses are not called hacks, nor
one of Leader&rsquo;s park-phaetons is not styled a buggy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Martin threw himself into a chair, and after a moment&rsquo;s struggle, burst
out into a fit of laughter.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I think we may make a deal after all, Sir Spencer,&rdquo; said Merl, who
accepted the baronet&rsquo;s correction with admirable self-control.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, sir; perfectly impossible; take my word for it, any transaction would
be difficult between us. Good-bye, Martin; adieu, Claude.&rdquo; And with this
brief leave-taking the peppery Sir Spencer left the room, more flushed and
fussy than he had entered it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you knew Sir Spencer Cavendish as long as we have known him, Mr.
Merl,&rdquo; said Lord Claude, in his blandest of voices, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d not be
surprised at this little display of warmth. It is the only weakness in a
very excellent fellow.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;m hot, too, my Lord,&rdquo; said Merl, with the very slightest accentuation
of the &ldquo;initial H,&rdquo; &ldquo;and he was right in saying that dealings would be
difficult between us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You mentioned Massingbred awhile ago, Merl. Why not ask him to second you
at the Club?&rdquo; said Martin, rousing himself suddenly from a train of
thought.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, somehow, I thought that he and you did n&rsquo;t exactly pull together;
that there was an election contest,&mdash;a kind of a squabble.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;m sure that <i>he</i> never gave you any reason to suspect a coldness
between us; I know that <i>I</i> never did,&rdquo; said Martin, calmly. &ldquo;We are
but slightly acquainted, it is true, but I should be surprised to learn
that there was any ill-feeling between us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;One&rsquo;s opponent at the hustings is pretty much the same thing as one&rsquo;s
adversary at a game,&mdash;he is against you to-day, and may be your
partner to-morrow; so that, putting even better motives aside, it were bad
policy to treat him as an implacable enemy,&rdquo; said Lord Claude, with his
accustomed suavity. &ldquo;Besides, Mr. Merl, you know the crafty maxim of the
French moralist, &lsquo;Always treat your enemies as though one day they were to
become your friends.&rsquo;&rdquo; And with this commonplace, uttered in a tone and
with a manner that gave it all the semblance of a piece of special advice,
his Lordship took his hat, and, squeezing Martin&rsquo;s hand, moved towards the
door.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come in here for a moment,&rdquo; said Martin, pushing open the door into an
adjoining dressing-room, and closing it carefully after them. &ldquo;So much for
wanting to do a good-natured thing,&rdquo; cried he, peevishly. &ldquo;I thought to
help Cavendish to get rid of those &lsquo;screws,&rsquo; and the return he makes me is
to outrage this man.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What are your dealings with him?&rdquo; asked Willoughby» anxiously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Play matters, play debts, loans, securities, post-obits, and every other
blessed contrivance you can think of to swamp a man&rsquo;s present fortune and
future prospects. I don&rsquo;t think he is a bad fellow; I mean, I don&rsquo;t
suspect he &lsquo;d press heavily upon me, with any fair treatment on my part.
My impression, in short, is that he&rsquo;d forgive my not meeting his bill, but
he &lsquo;d never get over my not inviting him to a dinner!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Willoughby, encouragingly, &ldquo;we live in admirable times for
such practices. There used to be a vulgar prejudice in favor of men that
one knew, and names that the world was familiar with. It is gone by
entirely; and if you only present your friend&mdash;don&rsquo;t wince at the
title&mdash;your friend, I say&mdash;as the rich Mr. Merl, the man who
owns shares in mines, canals, and collieries, whose speculations count by
tens of thousands, and whose credit rises to millions, you&rsquo;ll never be
called on to apologize for his parts of speech, or make excuse for his
solecisms in good breeding.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will you put up his name, then, at the Club?&rdquo; asked Martin, eagerly. &ldquo;It
would not do for <i>me</i> to do so.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure I will, and Massingbred shall be his seconder.&rdquo; And with this
cheering pledge Lord Claude bade him good-bye, and left him free to return
to Mr. Merl in the drawing-room. That gentleman had, however, already
departed, to the no small astonishment of Martin, who now threw himself
lazily down on a sofa, to ponder over his difficulties and weave all
manner of impracticable schemes to meet them.
</p>
<p>
They were, indeed, very considerable embarrassments. He had raised heavy
sums at most exorbitant rates, and obtained money&mdash;for the play-table&mdash;by
pledging valuable reversions of various kinds, for Merl somehow was the
easiest of all people to deal with; one might have fancied that he lent
his money only to afford himself an occasion of sympathy with the
borrower, just as he professed that he merely betted &ldquo;to have a little
interest in the race.&rdquo; Whatever Martin, then, suggested in the way of
security never came amiss; whether it were a farm, a mill, a quarry, or a
lead mine, he accepted it at once, and, as Martin deemed, without the
slightest knowledge or investigation, little suspecting that there was not
a detail of his estate, nor a resource of his property, with which the
wily Jew was not more familiar than himself. In fact, Mr. Merl was an
astonishing instance of knowledge on every subject by which money was to
be made, and he no more advanced loans upon an encumbered estate than he
backed the wrong horse or bid for a copied picture. There is a species of
practical information excessively difficult to describe, which is not
connoisseurship, but which supplies the place of that quality, enabling
him who possesses it to estimate the value of an object, without any
admixture of those weakening prejudices which beset your mere man of
taste. Now, Mr. Merl had no caprices about the color of the horse he
backed, no more than for the winning seat at cards; he could not be warped
from his true interests by any passing whim, and whether he cheapened a
Correggio or discounted a bill, he was the same calm, dispassionate
calculator of the profit to come of the transaction.
</p>
<p>
Latterly, however, he had thrown out a hint to Martin that he was curious
to see some of that property on which he had made such large advances; and
this wish&mdash;which, according to the frame of mind he happened to be in
at the moment, struck Martin as a mere caprice or a direct menace&mdash;was
now the object of his gloomy reveries. We have not tracked his steps
through the tortuous windings of his moneyed difficulties; it is a chapter
in life wherein there is wonderfully little new to record; the Jew-lender
and his associates, the renewed bill and the sixty per cent, the
non-restored acceptances flitting about the world, sold and resold as
damaged articles, but always in the end falling into the hands of a &ldquo;most
respectable party,&rdquo; and proceeded on as a true debt; then, the compromises
for time, for silence, for secrecy,&mdash;since these transactions are
rarely, if ever, devoid of some unhappy incident that would not bear
publicity; and there are invariably little notes beginning &ldquo;Dear Moses,&rdquo;
 which would argue most ill-chosen intimacies. These are all old stories,
and the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Chronicle&rdquo; are full of them. There is a terrible
sameness about them, too. The dupe and the villain are stock characters
that never change, and the incidents are precisely alike in every case.
Humble folk, who are too low for fashionable follies, wonder how the
self-same artifices have always the same success, and cannot conceal their
astonishment at the innocence of our young men about town; and yet the
mystery is easily solved. The dupe is, in these cases, just as
unprincipled as his betrayer, and their negotiation is simply a game of
skill, in which Israel is not always the winner.
</p>
<p>
If we have not followed Martin&rsquo;s steps through these dreary labyrinths, it
is because the path is a worn one; for the same reason, too, we decline to
keep him company in his ponderings over them. All that his troubles had
taught him was an humble imitation of the tricky natures of those he dealt
with; so that he plotted and schemed and contrived, till his very head
grew weary with the labor. And so we leave him.

<h2>
CHAPTER III. A YOUNG DUCHESS AND AN OLD FRIEND
</h2>
<p>
Like a vast number of people who have passed years in retirement, Lady
Dorothea was marvellously disappointed with &ldquo;the world&rdquo; when she went back
to it. It was not at all the kind of thing she remembered, or at least
fancied it to be. There were not the old gradations of class strictly
defined; there was not the old veneration for rank and station; &ldquo;society&rdquo;
 was invaded by hosts of unknown people, &ldquo;names one had never heard of.&rdquo;
 The great stars of fashion of her own day had long since set, and the new
celebrities had never as much as heard of her. The great houses of the
Faubourg were there, it is true; but with reduced households and dimly
lighted salons, they were but sorry representatives of the splendor her
memory had invested them with.
</p>
<p>
Now the Martins were installed in one of the finest apartments of the
finest quarter in Paris. They were people of unquestionable station, they
had ample means, lacked for none of the advantages which the world demands
from those who seek its favors; and yet there they were, just as unknown,
unvisited, and unsought after, as if they were the Joneses or the Smiths,
&ldquo;out&rdquo; for a month&rsquo;s pleasuring on the Continent.
</p>
<p>
A solitary invitation to the Embassy to dinner was not followed by any
other attention; and so they drove along the Boulevards and through the
Bois de Boulogne, and saw some thousands of gay, bright-costumed people,
all eager for pleasure, all hurrying on to some scheme of amusement or
enjoyment, while they returned moodily to their handsome quarter, as much
excluded from all participation in what went on around them as though they
were natives of Hayti.
</p>
<p>
Martin sauntered down to the reading-room, hoping vainly to fall in with
some one he knew. He lounged listlessly along the bright streets, till
their very glare addled him; he stared at the thousand new inventions of
luxury and ease the world had discovered since he had last seen it, and
then he plodded gloomily homeward, to dine and listen to her Ladyship&rsquo;s
discontented criticism upon the tiresome place and the odious people who
filled it. Paris was, indeed, a deception and a snare to them! So far from
finding it cheap, the expense of living&mdash;as they lived&mdash;was
considerably greater than at London. It was a city abounding in luxuries,
but all costly. The details which are in England reserved for days of
parade and display, were here daily habits, and these were now to be
indulged in with all the gloom of solitude and isolation.
</p>
<p>
What wonder, then, if her Ladyship&rsquo;s temper was ruffled, and her
equanimity unbalanced by such disappointments? In vain she perused the
list of arrivals to find out some distinguished acquaintance; in vain she
interrogated her son as to what was going on, and who were there. The
Captain only frequented the club, and could best chronicle the names that
were great at whist or illustrious at billiards.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It surely cannot be the season here,&rdquo; cried she, one morning, peevishly,
&ldquo;for really there isn&rsquo;t a single person one has ever heard of at Paris.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet this is a strong catalogue,&rdquo; cried the Captain, with a malicious
twinkle in his eye. &ldquo;Here are two columns of somebodies, who were present
at Madame de Luygnes&rsquo; last night.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You can always fill salons, if that be all,&rdquo; said she, angrily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but not with Tour du Pins, Tavannes, Rochefoucaulds, Howards of
Maiden, and Greys of Allington, besides such folk as Pahlen, Lichtenstein,
Colonna, and so forth.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How is it then, that one never sees them?&rdquo; cried she, more eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Say, rather, how is it one doesn&rsquo;t know them,&rdquo; cried Martin, &ldquo;for here we
are seven weeks, and, except to that gorgeous fellow in the cocked hat at
the porter&rsquo;s lodge, I have never exchanged a salute with a human being.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There are just three houses, they say, in all Paris, to one or other of
which one must be presented,&rdquo; said the Captain&mdash;&ldquo;Madame de Luygnes,
the Duchesse de Cour-celles, and Madame de Mirecourt.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That Madame de Luygnes was your old mistress, was she not, Miss
Henderson?&rdquo; asked Lady Dorothea, haughtily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lady,&rdquo; was the calm reply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And who are these other people?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Duc de Mirecourt was married to &lsquo;Mademoiselle,&rsquo; the daughter of the
Duchesse de Luygnes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you heard or seen anything of them since you came here?&rdquo; asked her
Ladyship.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, my Lady, except a hurried salute yesterday from a carriage as we
drove in. I just caught sight of the Duchesse as she waved her hand to
me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I saw it. I returned the salutation, never suspecting it was meant
for <i>you</i>. And she was your companion&mdash;your dear friend&mdash;long
ago?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lady,&rdquo; said Kate, bending down over her work, but showing in the
crimson flush that spread over her neck how the speech had touched her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you used to correspond, I think?&rdquo; continued her Ladyship.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We did so, my Lady.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And she dropped it, of course, when she married,&mdash;she had other
things to think of?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;m afraid, my Lady, the lapse was on <i>my</i> side,&rdquo; said Kate,
scarcely repressing a smile at her own hardihood.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Your</i> side! Do you mean to say that you so far forgot what was due
to the station of the Duchesse de Mirecourt, that you left her letter
unreplied to?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not exactly, my Lady.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then, pray, what do you mean?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kate paused for a second or two, and then, in a very calm and collected
voice, replied,&mdash;&ldquo;I told the Duchesse, in my last letter, that I
should write no more,&mdash;that my life was thrown in a wild,
unfrequented region, where no incident broke the monotony, and that were I
to continue our correspondence, my letters must degenerate into a mere
selfish record of my own sentiments, as unprofitable to read as ungraceful
to write; and so I said good-bye&mdash;or <i>au revoir</i>, at least&mdash;till
other scenes might suggest other thoughts.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A most complimentary character of our Land of the West, certainly! I
really was not aware before that Cro&rsquo; Martin was regarded as an
‘oubliette.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kate made no answer,&mdash;a silence which seemed rather to irritate than
appease her Ladyship.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope you included the family in your dreary picture. I trust it was not
a mere piece of what artists call still life, Miss Henderson?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, my Lady,&rdquo; said she, with a deep sigh; but the tone and manner of the
rejoinder were anything but apologetic.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now I call that as well done as anything one sees in Hyde Park,&rdquo; cried
the Captain, directing attention as he spoke to a very handsome chariot
which had just driven up to the door. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re inquiring for somebody
here,&rdquo; continued he, as he watched the Chasseur as he came and went from
the carriage to the house.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Grandee of Spain, or something of that kind, lives on the
fourth floor, I think,&rdquo; said Martin, dryly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Duchesse de Mirecourt, my Lady,&rdquo; said a servant, entering, &ldquo;begs to
know if your Ladyship will receive her?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kate started at the words, and her color rose till her cheeks were
crimsoned.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A visit, I suspect, rather for you than me, Miss Henderson,&rdquo; said Lady
Dorothea, in a half-whisper; and then turning to her servant, nodded her
acquiescence.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;m off,&rdquo; said Martin, rising suddenly to make his escape.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I too,&rdquo; said the Captain, as he made his exit by an opposite door.
</p>
<p>
The folding-doors of the apartment were at the same moment thrown wide,
and the Duchess entered. Very young,&mdash;almost girlish, indeed,&mdash;she
combined in her appearance the charming freshness of youth with that
perfection of gracefulness which attaches to the higher classes of French
society, and although handsome, more striking from the fascination of
manner than for any traits of beauty. Courtesying slightly, but
deferentially, to Lady Dorothea, she apologized for her intrusion by the
circumstance of having, the day before, caught sight of her &ldquo;dear
governess and dear friend&mdash;&rdquo; And as she reached thus far, the
deep-drawn breathing of another attracted her. She turned and saw Kate,
who, pale as a statue, stood leaning on a chair. In an instant she was in
her arms, exclaiming, in a rapture of delight, &ldquo;My dear, dear Kate,&mdash;my
more than sister! You would forgive me, madam,&rdquo; said she, addressing Lady
Dorothea, &ldquo;if you but knew what we were to each other. Is it not so,
Kate?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A faint tremulous motion of the lips&mdash;all colorless as they were&mdash;was
the only reply to the speech; but the young Frenchwoman needed none, but
turning to her Ladyship, poured forth with native volubility a story of
their friendship, the graceful language in which she uttered it lending
those choice phrases which never seem exaggerations of sentiment till they
be translated into other tongues. Mingling her praises with half
reproaches, she drew a picture of Kate so flattering that Lady Dorothea
could not help a sense of shrinking terror that one should speak in such
terms of the governess.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And now, dearest,&rdquo; added she, turning to Kate, &ldquo;are we to see a great
deal of each other? When can you come to me? Pardon me, madam, this
question should be addressed to you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Miss Henderson is my secretary, Madame la Duchesse; she is also my
companion,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea, haughtily; &ldquo;but I can acknowledge claims
which take date before my own. She shall be always at liberty when you
wish for her.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How kind, how good of you!&rdquo; cried the Duchess. &ldquo;I could have been certain
of that. I knew that my dear Kate must be loved by all around her. We have
a little <i>fête</i> on Wednesday at St. Germain. May I bespeak her for
that day?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Her Ladyship suffers her generosity to trench upon her too far,&rdquo; said
Kate, in a low voice. &ldquo;I am in a manner necessary to her,&mdash;that is,
my absence would be inconvenient.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But her Ladyship will doubtless be in the world herself that evening.
There is a ball at the Duchesse de Sargance, and the Austrian Minister has
something,&rdquo; rattled on the lively Duchess. &ldquo;Paris is so gay just now, so
full of pleasant people, and all so eager for enjoyment. Don&rsquo;t you find it
so, my Lady?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I go but little into society!&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea, stiffly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How strange! and I&mdash;I cannot live without it. Even when we go to our
Château at Roche-Mire I carry away with me all my friends who will consent
to come. We try to imitate that delightful life of your country houses,
and make up that great family party which is the <i>beau idéal</i> of
social enjoyment.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you like a country life, then?&rdquo; asked her Ladyship.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure. I love the excursions on horseback, the forest drives, the
evening walks in the trellised vines, the parties one makes to see a
thousand things one never looks at afterwards; the little dinners on the
grass, with all their disasters, and the moonlight drive homewards, half
joyous, half romantic,&mdash;not to speak of that charming frankness by
which every one makes confession of his besetting weakness, and each has
some little secret episode of his own life to tell the others. All but
Kate here,&rdquo; cried she, laughingly, &ldquo;who never revealed anything.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Madame la Duchesse will, I &lsquo;m sure, excuse my absence; she has doubtless
many things she would like to say to her friend alone,&rdquo; said Lady
Dorothea, rising and courtesying formally; and the young Duchess returned
the salutation with equal courtesy and respect.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear, dear Kate,&rdquo; cried she, throwing her arms around her as the door
closed after her Ladyship, &ldquo;how I have longed for this moment, to tell you
ten thousand things about myself and hear from you as many more! And
first, dearest, are you happy? for you look more serious, more thoughtful
than you used,&mdash;and paler, too.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Am I so?&rdquo; asked Kate, faintly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. When you&rsquo;re not speaking, your brows grow stern and your lips
compressed. Your features have not that dear repose, as Giorgevo used to
call it. Poor fellow! how much in love he was, and you &lsquo;ve never asked for
him!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I never thought of him!&rdquo; said she, with a smile.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nor of Florian, Kate!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nor even of him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0003" id="linkimage-0003">
<!-- IMG --></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/044.jpg" width="100%" alt="044 " />
</div>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet that poor fellow was really in love,&mdash;nay, don&rsquo;t laugh,
Kate, I know it. He gave up his career, everything he had in life,&mdash;he
was a Secretary of Legation, with good prospects,&mdash;all to win your
favor, becoming a &lsquo;Carbonaro,&rsquo; or a &lsquo;Montagnard,&rsquo; or something or other
that swears to annihilate all kings and extirpate monarchy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And after that?&rdquo; asked Kate, with more of interest.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;After that, ma chère, they sent him to the galleys; I forget exactly
where, but I think it was in Sicily. And then there was that Hungarian
Count Nemescz, that wanted to kill somebody who picked up your bouquet out
of the Grand Canal at Venice.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And whom, strangely enough, I met and made acquaintance with in Ireland.
His name is Massingbred.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not the celebrity, surely,&mdash;the young politician who made such a
sensation by a first speech in Parliament t&rsquo;other day? He&rsquo;s all the rage
here. Could it be him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Possibly enough,&rdquo; said she, carelessly. &ldquo;He had very good abilities, and
knew it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He comes to us occasionally, but I scarcely have any acquaintance with
him. But this is not telling me of yourself, child. Who and what are these
people you are living with? Do they value my dear Kate as they ought? Are
they worthy of having her amongst them?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; said Kate, with a smile. &ldquo;They do not seem at all
impressed with the blessing they enjoy, and only treat me as one of
themselves.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But, seriously, child, are they as kind as they should be? That old lady
is, to my thinking, as austere as an Archduchess.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I like her,&rdquo; said Kate; &ldquo;that is, I like her cold, reserved manner,
unbending as it is, which only demands the quiet duties of servitude, and
neither asks nor wishes for affection. She admits me to no friendship, but
she exacts no attachment.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you like this?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I did not say I should like it from <i>you!</i> said Kate, pressing the
hand she held fervently to her lips, while her pale cheek grew faintly
red.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you go into the world with her,&mdash;at least <i>her</i> world?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She has none here. Too haughty for second-rate society, and unknown to
those who form the first class at Paris, she never goes out.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But she would&mdash;she would like to do so?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;m sure she would.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then mamma shall visit her. You know she is everything here; her house is
the rendezvous of all the distinguished people, and, once seen in her
salons, my Lady&mdash;how do you call her?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lady Dorothea Martin.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t repeat it&mdash;but no matter&mdash;her Ladyship shall not want
for attentions. Perhaps she would condescend to come to me on Wednesday?
Dare I venture to ask her?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kate hesitated, and the Duchess quickly rejoined,&mdash;&ldquo;No, dearest, you
are quite right; it would be hazardous, too abrupt, too unceremonious. You
will, however, be with us; and I long to present you to all my friends,
and show them one to whom I owe so much, and ought to be indebted to for
far more. I &lsquo;ll send for you early, that we may have a long morning
together.&rdquo; And so saying, she arose to take leave.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I feel as though I &lsquo;ll scarcely believe I had seen you when you have
gone,&rdquo; said Kate, earnestly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fancy it all a dream&mdash;or rather,
that my life since we met has been one, and that we had never parted.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Were we not very happy then, Kate?&rdquo; said the Duchess, with a half-sigh;
&ldquo;happier, perhaps, than we may ever be again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>You</i> must not say so, at all events,&rdquo; said Kate, once more
embracing her. And they parted.
</p>
<p>
Kate arose and watched the splendid equipage as it drove away, and then
slowly returned to her place at the work-table. She did not, however,
resume her embroidery, but sat deep in reflection, with her hands clasped
before her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; said she, at length, &ldquo;a galley-slave, and Massingbred a
celebrity! So much for honesty and truth in this good world of ours! Can
it always go on thus? That is the question I&rsquo;m curious to hear solved. A
little time may, perhaps, reveal it!&rdquo; So saying to herself, she leaned her
head upon her hand, deep lost in thought.

<h2>
CHAPTER IV. A VERY GREAT FAVOR
</h2>
<p>
Amongst the embarrassments of story-telling there is one which, to be
appreciated, must have been experienced; it is, however, sufficiently
intelligible to claim sympathy even by indicating,&mdash;we mean the
difficulty a narrator has in the choice of those incidents by which his
tale is to be marked out, and the characters who fill it adequately
depicted.
</p>
<p>
It is quite clear that a great number of events must occur in the story of
every life of which no record can be made; some seem too trivial, some too
irrelevant for mention, and yet, when we come to reflect upon real life
itself, how many times do we discover that what appeared to be but the
veriest trifles were the mainsprings of an entire existence, and the
incidents which we deemed irrelevant were the hidden links that connected
a whole chain of events? How easy, then, to err in the selection! This
difficulty presents itself strongly to us at present; a vast number of
circumstances rise before us from which we must refrain, lest they should
appear to indicate a road we are not about to travel; and, at the same
time, we feel the want of those very events to reconcile what may well
seem contradictions in our history.
</p>
<p>
It not unfrequently happens that an apology is just as tiresome as the
offence it should excuse; and so, without further explanation, we proceed.
Lady Dorothea soon found herself as much sought after as she had
previously been neglected. The Duchesse de Luygnes was the great leader of
fashion at Paris; and the marked attentions by which she distinguished her
Ladyship at once established her position. Of course her unquestionable
claim to station, and her own high connections rendered the task less
difficult; while it imparted to Lady Dorothea&rsquo;s own manner and bearing
that degree of dignity and calm which never accompany an insecure
elevation.
</p>
<p>
With such refinement of delicacy, such exquisite tact, was every step
managed that her Ladyship was left to suppose every attention she received
sprung out of her own undeniable right to them, and to the grace and charm
of a manner which really had had its share of success some five-and-thirty
years before. The gloomy isolation she had passed through gave a stronger
contrast to the enjoyment of her present life; and for the first time for
years she regained some of that courtly elegance of address which in her
youth had pre-eminently distinguished her. The change had worked favorably
in her temper also; and Martin perceived, with astonishment, that she
neither made injurious comparisons between the present and the past, nor
deemed the age they lived in one of insufferable vulgarity. It would
scarcely have been possible for Lady Dorothea not to connect her altered
position with the friendship between Kate Henderson and her former pupil;
she knew it, and she felt it. All her self-esteem could not get over this
consciousness; but it was a humiliation reserved for her own heart, since
nothing in Kate&rsquo;s manner indicated even a suspicion of the fact. On the
contrary, never had she shown herself more submissive and dependent. The
duties of her office, multiplied as they were tenfold by her Ladyship&rsquo;s
engagements, were all punctually acquitted, and with a degree of tact and
cleverness that obtained from Lady Dorothea the credit of a charming
note-writer. Nor was she indifferent to the effect Kate produced in
society, where her beauty and fascination had already made a deep
impression.
</p>
<p>
Reserving a peculiar deference and respect for all her intercourse with
Lady Dorothea, Kate Henderson assumed to the world at large the ease and
dignity of one whose station was the equal of any. There was nothing in
her air or bearing that denoted the dependant; there was rather a dash of
haughty superiority, which did not scruple to avow itself and bid defiance
to any bold enough to question its claims. Even this was a secret flattery
to Lady Dorothea&rsquo;s heart; and she saw with satisfaction the success of
that imperious tone which to herself was subdued to actual humility.
</p>
<p>
Lady Dorothea Martin and her beautiful companion were now celebrities at
Paris; and, assuredly, no city of the world knows how to shower more
fascinations on those it favors. Life became to them a round of brilliant
festivities. They received invitations from every quarter, and everywhere
were met with that graceful welcome so sure to greet those whose airs and
whose dress are the ornaments of a salon. They &ldquo;received&rdquo; at home, too;
and her Ladyship&rsquo;s Saturdays were about the most exclusive of all Parisian
receptions. Tacitly, at least, the whole management and direction of these
&ldquo;Evenings&rdquo; was committed to Kate. Martin strictly abstained from a society
in every way distasteful to him. The Captain had come to care for nothing
but play, so that the Club was his only haunt; and it was the rarest of
all events to see him pass even a few minutes in the drawing-room. He had,
besides, that degree of shrinking dislike to Kate Henderson which a weak
man very often experiences towards a clever and accomplished girl. When he
first joined his family at Paris, he was struck by her great beauty and
the elegance of a manner that might have dignified any station, and he
fell partly in love,&mdash;that is to say, as much in love as a captain of
hussars could permit himself to feel for a governess. He condescended to
make small advances, show her petty attentions, and even distinguish her
by that flattering stare, with his glass to his eye, which he had known to
be what the poet calls &ldquo;blush-compelling&rdquo; in many a fair cheek in
provincial circles.
</p>
<p>
To his marvellous discomfiture, however, these measures were not followed
by any success. She never as much as seemed aware of them, and treated him
with the same polite indifference, as though he had been neither a hussar
nor a lady-killer. Of course he interpreted this as a piece of consummate
cunning; he had no other measure for her capacity than would have been
suited to his own. She was a deep one, evidently bent on drawing him on,
and entangling him in some stupid declaration, and so he grew cautious.
But, somehow, his reserve provoked as little as his boldness. She did not
change in the least; she treated him with a quiet, easy sort of no-notice,&mdash;the
most offensive thing possible to one bent upon being impressive, and
firmly persuaded that he need only wish, to be the conqueror.
</p>
<p>
Self-worship was too strong in him to suffer a single doubt as to his own
capacity for success, and therefore the only solution to the mystery of
her manner was its being an artful scheme, which time and a little
watching would surely explain. Time went on, and yet he grew none the
wiser; Kate continued the same impassive creature as at first. She never
sought,&mdash;never avoided him. She met him without constraint,&mdash;without
pleasure, too. They never became intimate, while there was no distance in
their intercourse; till at last, wounded in his self-esteem, he began to
feel that discomfort in her presence which only waits for the slightest
provocation to become actual dislike.
</p>
<p>
With that peevishness that belongs to small minds, he would have been glad
to have discovered some good ground for hating her; and a dozen times a
day did he fancy that he had &ldquo;hit the blot,&rdquo; but somehow he always
detected his mistake erelong; and thus did he live on in that tantalizing
state of uncertainty and indecision which combines about as much suffering
as men of his stamp are capable of feeling.
</p>
<p>
If Lady Dorothea never suspected the degree of influence Kate silently
exercised over her, the Captain saw it palpably, and tried to nourish the
knowledge into a ground for dislike. But somehow she would no more suffer
herself to be hated than to be loved, and invariably baffled all his
attempts to &ldquo;get up&rdquo; an indignation against her. By numberless devices&mdash;too
slight, too evanescent to be called regular coquetry&mdash;she understood
how to conciliate him, even in his roughest moods, while she had only to
make the very least possible display of her attractions to fascinate him
in his happier moments. The gallant hussar was not much given to
self-examination. It was one of the last positions he would have selected;
and yet he had confessed to his own heart that, though he &lsquo;d not like to
marry her himself, he &lsquo;d be sorely tempted to shoot any man who made her
his wife.
</p>
<p>
Lady Dorothea and Kate Henderson were seated one morning engaged in the
very important task of revising the invitation-book,&mdash;weeding out the
names of departed acquaintance, and canvassing the claims of those who
should succeed them. The rigid criticism as to eligibility showed how
great an honor was the card for her Ladyship&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tea.&rdquo; While they were thus
occupied, Captain Martin entered the room with an open letter in his hand,
his air and manner indicating flurry, if not actual agitation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sorry to interrupt a privy council,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve come to ask a
favor,&mdash;don&rsquo;t look frightened; it&rsquo;s not for a woman, my Lady,&mdash;but
I want a card for your next Saturday, for a male friend of mine.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Kate has just been telling me that &lsquo;our men&rsquo; are too numerous.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Impossible. Miss Henderson knows better than any one that the success of
these things depends on having a host of men,&mdash;all ages, all classes,
all sorts of people,&rdquo; said he, indolently.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I think we have complied with your theory,&rdquo; said she, pointing to the
book before her. &ldquo;If our ladies are chosen for their real qualities, the
men have been accepted with a most generous forbearance.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;One more, then, will not damage the mixture.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course, Captain Martin, it is quite sufficient that he is a friend of
yours&mdash;that you wish it&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But it is no such thing, Miss Henderson,&rdquo; broke in Lady Dorothea. &ldquo;We
have already given deep umbrage in many quarters&mdash;very high quarters,
too&mdash;by refusals; and a single mistake would be fatal to us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But why need this be a mistake?&rdquo; cried Captain Martin, peevishly. &ldquo;The
man is an acquaintance of mine,&mdash;a friend, if you like to call him
so.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And who is he?&rdquo; asked my Lady, with all the solemnity of a judge.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A person I met at the Cape. We travelled home together&mdash;saw a great
deal of each other&mdash;in fact&mdash;I know him as intimately as I do&mdash;any
officer in my regiment,&rdquo; said the Captain, blundering and faltering at
every second word.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! then he is one of your own corps?&rdquo; said her Ladyship.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I never said so,&rdquo; broke he in. &ldquo;If he had been, I don&rsquo;t fancy I should
need to employ much solicitation in his behalf; the&mdash;they are not
usually treated in that fashion!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I trust we should know how to recognize their merits,&rdquo; said Kate, with a
look which sorely puzzled him whether it meant conciliation or raillery.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And his name?&rdquo; asked my Lady. &ldquo;His name ought to be decisive, without
anything more!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s quite a stranger here, knows nobody, so that you incur no risk as to
any impertinent inquiries, and when he leaves this, to-morrow or next day,
you &lsquo;ll never see him again.&rdquo; This the Captain said with all the confusion
of an inexpert man in a weak cause.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Shall I address his card, or will you take it yourself, Captain Martin?&rdquo;
 said Kate, in a low voice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Write Merl,&mdash;Mr. Herman Merl,&rdquo; said he, dropping his own voice to
the same tone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Merl!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Dorothea, whose quick hearing detected the words.
&ldquo;Why, where on earth could you have made acquaintance with a man called
Merl?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have told you already where and how we met; and if it be any
satisfaction to you to know that I am under considerable obligations&mdash;heavy
obligations&mdash;to this same gentleman, perhaps it might incline you to
show him some mark of attention.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You could have him to dinner at your Club,&mdash;you might even bring him
here, when we&rsquo;re alone, Harry; but really, to receive him at one of our
Evenings! You know how curious people are, what questions they will ask:&mdash;&lsquo;Who
is that queer-looking man?&rsquo;&mdash;I &lsquo;m certain he is so.&mdash;&lsquo;Is he
English?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Who does he belong to?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Does he know any one?&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let them ask me, then,&rdquo; said Martin, &ldquo;and I may, perhaps, be able to
satisfy them.&rdquo; At the same moment he took up from the table the card which
Kate had just written, giving her a look of grateful recognition as he did
so.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You &lsquo;ve done this at your own peril, Miss Henderson,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea,
half upbraidingly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;At <i>mine</i>, be it rather,&rdquo; said the Captain, sternly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I accept my share of it willingly,&rdquo; said Kate, with a glance which
brought a deep flush over the hussar&rsquo;s cheek, and sent through him a
strange thrill of pleasure.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then I am to suppose we shall be honored with your own presence on this
occasion,&mdash;rare favor that it is,&rdquo; said her Ladyship.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I &lsquo;ll look in. I promised Merl to present him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you need n&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said she, peevishly. &ldquo;Half the men merely make their
bow when they meet me, and neither expect me to remember who they are or
to notice them. I may leave your distinguished friend in the same
category.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A quick glance from Kate&mdash;fleeting, but full of meaning&mdash;stopped
Martin as he was about to make a hasty reply. And, crumpling up the card
with suppressed passion, he turned and left the room.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put that odious name on our list, Miss Henderson,&rdquo; said Lady
Dorothea; &ldquo;we shall never have him again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;m rather curious to see him,&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;All this discussion has
imparted a kind of interest to him, not to say that there would seem
something like a mystery in Captain Martin&rsquo;s connection with him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I confess to no such curiosity,&rdquo; said my Lady, haughtily. &ldquo;The taste to
be amused by vulgarity is like the passion some people have to see an
hospital; you may be interested by the sight, but you may catch a malady
for your pains.&rdquo; And with this observation of mingled truth and fallacy
her Ladyship sailed proudly out of the room in all the conscious
importance of her own cleverness.

<h2>
CHAPTER V. A LETTER FROM HOME
</h2>
<p>
While this discussion was going on, Martin was seated in his own room,
examining the contents of his letter-bag, which the post had just
delivered to him. A very casual glance at his features would have
discovered that the tidings which met his eye were very rarely of a
pleasant character. For the most part the letters were importunate appeals
for money, subscriptions, loans, small sums to be repaid when the borrower
had risen above his present difficulties, aids to effect some little
enterprise on whose very face was failure. Then there were the more formal
demands for sums actually due, written in the perfection of coercive
courtesy, subjecting the reader to all the tortures of a moral surgical
operation, a suffering actually increased by the very dexterity of the
manipulator. Then came, in rugged hand and gnarled shape, urgent
entreaties for abatements and allowances, pathetic pictures of failing
crops, sickness and sorrow! Somewhat in contrast to these in matter&mdash;most
strikingly unlike them in manner&mdash;was a short note from Mr. Maurice
Scanlan. Like a rebutting witness in a cause, he spoke of everything as
going on favorably; prices were fair, the oat crop a reasonable one. There
was distress, to be sure, but who ever saw the West without it? The
potatoes had partially failed; but as there was a great deal of typhus and
a threat of cholera, there would be fewer to eat them. The late storms had
done a good deal of mischief, but as the timber thrown down might be sold
without any regard to the entail, some thousand pounds would thus be
realized; and as the gale had carried away the new pier at Kilkieran,
there would be no need to give a bounty to the fishermen who could not
venture out to sea. The damage done to the house and the conservatories at
Cro&rsquo; Martin offered an opportunity to congratulate the owner on the
happiness of living in a milder climate; while the local squabbles of the
borough suggested a pleasant contrast with all the enjoyments of a life
abroad.
</p>
<p>
On the whole, Mr. Scanlan&rsquo;s letter was rather agreeable than the reverse,
since he contrived to accompany all the inevitable ills of fortune by some
side-wind consolations, and when pushed hard for these, skilfully
insinuated in what way &ldquo;things might have been worse.&rdquo; If the letter did
not reflect very favorably on either the heart or brain that conceived it,
it well suited him to whom it was addressed. To screen himself from
whatever might irritate him, to escape an unpleasant thought or unhappy
reflection, to avoid, above all things, the slightest approach of
self-censure, was Martin&rsquo;s great philosophy; and he esteemed the man who
gave him any aid in this road. Now newspapers might croak their dark
predictions about the coming winter, prophesy famine, fever, and
pestilence; Scanlan&rsquo;s letter, &ldquo;written from the spot,&rdquo; by &ldquo;one who enjoyed
every opportunity for forming a correct opinion,&rdquo; was there, and <i>he</i>
said matters were pretty much as usual. The West of Ireland had never been
a land of milk and honey, and nobody expected it ever would be,&mdash;the
people could live in it, however, and pay rents too; and as Martin felt
that he had no undue severity to reproach himself with, he folded up the
epistle, saying that &ldquo;when a man left his house and property for a while,
it was a real blessing to have such a fellow as Scanlan to manage for
him;&rdquo; and truly, if one could have his conscience kept for a few hundreds
a year, the compact might be a pleasant one. But even to the most
self-indulgent this plan is impracticable; and so might it now be seen in
Martin&rsquo;s heightened color and fidgety manner, and that even <i>he</i> was
not as much at ease within as he wished to persuade himself he was.
</p>
<p>
Amid the mass of correspondence, pamphlets and newspapers, one note, very
small and neatly folded, had escaped Martin&rsquo;s notice till the very last;
and it was only as he heaped up a whole bundle to throw into the fire that
he discovered this, in Mary&rsquo;s well-known hand. He held it for some time
ere he broke the seal, and his features assumed a sadder, graver cast than
before. His desertion of her&mdash;and he had not blinked the word to
himself&mdash;had never ceased to grieve him; and however disposed he
often felt to throw upon others the blame which attached to himself here,
he attempted no casuistry, but stood quietly, without one plea in his
favor, before his own heart.
</p>
<p>
The very consciousness of his culpability had prevented him writing to her
as he ought; his letters were few, short, and constrained. Not all the
generous frankness of hers could restore to him the candid ease of his
former intercourse with her; and every chance expression he used was
conned over and canvassed by him, lest it might convey some sentiment, or
indicate some feeling foreign to his intention. At length so painful had
the task become that he had ceased writing altogether, contenting himself
with a message through Kate Henderson,&mdash;some excuse about his health,
fatigue,-and so forth, ever coupled with a promise that he would soon be
himself again, and as active a correspondent as she could desire.
</p>
<p>
To these apologies Mary always replied in a kindly spirit. Whatever sorrow
they might have cost her she kept for herself; they never awakened one
expression of impatience, not a word of reproach. She understood him
thoroughly,&mdash;his easy indolence of disposition, his dislike to a
task, his avoidance of whatever was possible to defer; more even than all
these, his own unforgiveness of himself for his part towards her. To
alleviate, so far as she might, the poignancy of the last, was for a while
the great object of all her letters; and so she continued to expatiate on
the happy life she was leading, her contentment with the choice she had
made of remaining there, throwing in little playful sallies of condolence
at her uncle&rsquo;s banishment, and jestingly assuring him how much happier he
would be at home!
</p>
<p>
In whatever mood, however, she wrote, there was a striking absence of
whatever could fret or grieve her uncle throughout all her letters. She
selected every pleasant topic and the favorable side of every theme to
tell of. She never forgot any little locality which he had been partial
to, or any of the people who were his favorites; and, in fact, it might
have seemed that the great object she had in view was to attach him more
and more to the home he had left, and strengthen every tie that bound him
to his own country. And all this was done lightly and playfully, and with
a pleasant promise of the happiness he should feel on the day of his
return.
</p>
<p>
These letters were about the pleasantest incidents in Martin&rsquo;s present
life; and the day which brought him one was sure to pass agreeably, while
he made vigorous resolutions about writing a reply, and sometimes got even
so far as to open a desk and ruminate over an answer. It so chanced that
now a much longer interval had occurred since Mary&rsquo;s last letter, and the
appearance of the present note, so unlike the voluminous epistle she
usually despatched, struck him with a certain dismay. &ldquo;Poor Molly,&rdquo; said
he, as he broke the seal, &ldquo;she is growing weary at last; this continued
neglect is beginning to tell upon her. A little more, and she &lsquo;ll believe&mdash;as
well she may&mdash;that we have forgotten her altogether.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The note was even briefer than he had suspected. It was written, too, in
what might seem haste, or agitation, and the signature forgotten. Martin&rsquo;s
hand trembled, and his chest heaved heavily as he read the following
lines:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Cro&rsquo; Martin, Wednesday Night
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dearest Uncle,&mdash;You will not suffer these few lines to remain
unanswered, since they are written in all the pressure of a great
emergency. Our worst fears for the harvest are more than realized; a total
failure in the potatoes&mdash;a great diminution in the oat crop; the
incessant rains have flooded all the low meadows, and the cattle are
almost without forage, while from the same cause no turf can be cut, and
even that already cut and stacked cannot be drawn away from the bogs. But,
worse than all these, typhus is amongst us, and cholera, they say, coming.
I might stretch out this dreary catalogue, but here is enough, more than
enough, to awaken your sympathies and arouse you to action. There is a
blight on the land; the people are starving&mdash;dying. If every sense of
duty was dead within us, if we could harden our hearts against every claim
of those from whose labor we derive ease, from whose toil we draw wealth
and leisure, we might still be recalled to better things by the glorious
heroism of these poor people, so nobly courageous, so patient are they in
their trials. It is not now that I can speak of the traits I have
witnessed of their affection, their charity, their self-denial, and their
daring&mdash;but now is the moment to show them that we, who have been
dealt with more favorably by fortune, are not devoid of the qualities
which adorn their nature.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I feel all the cruelty of narrating these things to you, too far away
from the scene of sorrow to aid by your counsel and encourage by your
assistance; but it would be worse than cruelty to conceal from you that a
terrible crisis is at hand, which will need all your energy to mitigate.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Some measures are in your power, and must be adopted at once. There must
be a remission of rent almost universally, for the calamity has involved
all; and such as are a little richer than their neighbors should be aided,
that they may be the more able to help them. Some stores of provisions
must be provided to be sold at reduced rates, or even given gratuitously.
Medical aid must be had, and an hospital of some sort established. The
able-bodied must be employed on some permanent work; and for these, we
want power from you and some present moneyed assistance. I will not harrow
your feelings with tales of sufferings. You have seen misery here&mdash;enough,
I say&mdash;you have witnessed nothing like this, and we are at but the
beginning.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Write to me at once yourself&mdash;this is no occasion to employ a deputy&mdash;and
forgive me, dearest uncle, for I know not what faults of presumption I may
have here committed. My head is confused; the crash of misfortunes has
addled me, and each succeed so rapidly on each other, that remedies are
scarcely employed than they have to be abandoned. When, however, I can
tell the people that it is their own old friend and master that sends them
help, and bids them to be of good cheer,&mdash;when I can show them that,
although separated by distance, your heart never ceases to live amongst
them,&mdash;I know well the magic working of such a spell upon them, and
how, with a bravery that the boldest soldier never surpassed, they will
rise up against the stern foes of sickness and famine, and do battle with
hard fortune manfully.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have often smiled at what you deemed my exaggerated opinion of these
poor people,&mdash;my over-confidence in their capacity for good. Oh&mdash;take
my word for it&mdash;I never gave them credit for one half the excellence
of their natures. They are on their trial now, and nobly do they sustain
it!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have no heart to answer all your kind questions about myself,&mdash;enough
that I am well; as little can I ask you about all your doings in Paris. I
‘m afraid I should but lose temper if I heard that they were pleasant
ones; and yet, with my whole soul, I wish you to be happy; and with this,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Believe me your affectionate
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Repton has written me the kindest of letters, full of good advice and
good sense; he has also enclosed me a check for £100, with an offer of
more if wanted. I was low and depressed when his note reached me, but it
gave me fresh energy and hope. He proposed to come down here if I wished;
but how could I ask such a sacrifice,&mdash;how entreat him to face the
peril?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tell Captain Martin I wish to speak to him,&rdquo; said Martin, as he finished
the perusal of this letter. And in a few minutes after, that gallant
personage appeared, not a little surprised at the summons.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have got a letter from Mary here,&rdquo; said Martin, vainly endeavoring to
conceal his agitation as he spoke, &ldquo;which I want to show you. Matters are
in a sad plight in the West. She never exaggerates a gloomy story, and her
account is very afflicting. Read it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The Captain lounged towards the window, and, leaning listlessly against
the wall, opened the epistle.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have not written to her lately, then?&rdquo; asked he, as he perused the
opening sentence.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am ashamed to say I have not; every day I made a resolution; but
somehow&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is all this anything strange or new?&rdquo; broke in the Captain. &ldquo;I &lsquo;m certain
I have forty letters from my mother with exactly the same story. In fact,
before I ever broke the seal, I &lsquo;d have wagered an equal fifty that the
potatoes had failed, the bogs were flooded, the roads impassable, and the
people dying in thousands; and yet, when spring came round, by some happy
miracle they were all alive and merry again!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Read on,&rdquo; said Martin, impatiently, and barely able to control himself at
this heartless commentary.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Egad! I &lsquo;d have sworn I had read all this before, except these same
suggestions about not exacting the rents, building hospitals, and so
forth; that <i>is</i> new. And why does she say, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t write by deputy&rsquo;?
Who <i>was</i> your deputy?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Kate Henderson has written for me latterly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I should say she &lsquo;s quite equal to that sort of thing; she dashes off
my mother&rsquo;s notes at score, and talks away, too, all the time she &lsquo;s
writing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is not the question before us,&rdquo; said Martin, sternly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;When I sent for you to read that letter, it was that you might advise and
counsel me what course to take.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you can afford to give away a year&rsquo;s income in the shape of rent, and
about as much more in the shape of a donation, of course you &lsquo;re quite
free to do it. I only wish that your generosity would begin at home,
though; for I own to you I &lsquo;m very hard-up at this moment.&rdquo; This the
Captain spoke with an attempted jocularity which decreased with every
word, till it subsided into downright seriousness ere he finished.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So far from being in a position to do an act of munificence, I am sorely
pressed for money,&rdquo; said Martin.
</p>
<p>
The Captain started; the half-smile with which he had begun to receive
this speech died away on his lips as he asked, &ldquo;Is this really the case?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Most truly so,&rdquo; said Martin, solemnly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But how, in the name of everything absurd&mdash;how is this possible? By
what stratagem could you have spent five thousand a year at Cro&rsquo; Martin,
and your estate was worth almost three times as much? Giving a very wide
margin for waste and robbery, I &lsquo;d say five thousand could not be made
away with there in a twelvemonth.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your question only shows me how carelessly you must have read my letters
to you, in India,&rdquo; said Martin; &ldquo;otherwise you could not have failed to
see the vast improvements we have been carrying out on the property,&mdash;the
roads, the harbors, the new quarries opened, the extent of ground covered
by plantation,&mdash;all the plans, in fact, which Mary had matured&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mary! Mary!&rdquo; exclaimed the Captain. &ldquo;And do you tell me that all these
things were done at the instigation of a young girl of nineteen or twenty,
without any knowledge, or even advice&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And who said she was deficient in knowledge?&rdquo; cried Martin. &ldquo;Take up the
map of the estate; see the lands she has reclaimed; look at the swamps you
used to shoot snipe over bearing corn crops; see the thriving village,
where once the boatmen were starving, for they dared not venture out to
sea without a harbor against bad weather.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tell me the cost of all this. What&rsquo;s the figure?&rdquo; said the Captain;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s the real test of all these matters, for if <i>your</i> income
could only feed this outlay, I pronounce the whole scheme the maddest
thing in Christendom. My mother&rsquo;s taste for carved oak cabinets and
historical pictures is the quintessence of wisdom in comparison.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Martin was overwhelmed and silent, and the other went on,&mdash;&ldquo;Half the
fellows in &lsquo;ours&rsquo; had the same story to tell,&mdash;of estates wasted, and
fine fortunes squandered in what are called improvements. If the
possession of a good property entails the necessity to spend it all in
this fashion, one is very little better than a kind of land-steward to
one&rsquo;s own estate; and, for my part, I &lsquo;d rather call two thousand a year
my own, to do what I pleased with, than have a nominal twenty, of which I
must disburse nineteen.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Am I again to remind you that this is not the question before us?&rdquo; said
Martin, with increased sternness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is exactly the very question,&rdquo; rejoined the Captain. &ldquo;Mary here
coolly asks you, in the spirit of this same improvement-scheme, to
relinquish a year&rsquo;s income, and make a present of I know not how much
more, simply because things are going badly with them, just as if
everybody has n&rsquo;t their turn of ill-fortune. Egad, I can answer for it, <i>mine</i>
has n&rsquo;t been flourishing latterly, and yet I have heard of no benevolent
plan on foot to aid or release me!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
To this heartless speech, uttered, however, in most perfect sincerity,
Martin made no reply whatever, but sat with folded arms, deep in
contemplation. At length, raising his head, he asked, &ldquo;And have you, then,
no counsel to give,&mdash;no suggestion to make me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, suddenly, &ldquo;if Mary has not greatly overcharged all this
story&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That she has not,&rdquo; cried Martin, interrupting him. &ldquo;There &lsquo;s not a line,
not a word of her letter, I &lsquo;d not guarantee with all I &lsquo;m worth in the
world.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; resumed the Captain, in the same indolent tone, &ldquo;they must
be in a sorry plight, and <i>I</i> think ought to cut and run as fast as
they can. I know that&rsquo;s what <i>we</i> do in India; when the cholera
comes, we break up the encampment, and move off somewhere else. Tell Mary,
then, to advise them to keep out of &lsquo;the jungle,&rsquo; and make for the hill
country.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Martin stared at the speaker for some seconds, and it was evident how
difficult he found it to believe that the words he had just listened to
were uttered in deliberate seriousness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you have read that letter, you certainly have not understood it,&rdquo; said
he at last, in a voice full of melancholy meaning.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Egad, it&rsquo;s only too easy of comprehension,&rdquo; replied the Captain; &ldquo;of all
things in life, there&rsquo;s no mistaking a demand for money.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just take it with you to your own room, Harry,&rdquo; said Martin, with a
manner of more affection than he had yet employed. &ldquo;It is my firm
persuasion that when you have re-read and thought over it, your impression
will be a different one. Con it over in solitude, and then come back and
give me your advice.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The Captain was not sorry to adopt a plan which relieved him so speedily
from a very embarrassing situation, and, folding up the note, he turned
and left the room.
</p>
<p>
There are a great number of excellent people in this world who believe
that &ldquo;Thought,&rdquo; like &ldquo;Écarté,&rdquo; is a game which requires two people to
play. The Captain was one of these; nor was it within his comprehension to
imagine how any one individual could suffice to raise the doubts he was
called on to canvass or decide. &ldquo;Who should he now have recourse to?&rdquo; was
his first question; and he had scarcely proposed it to himself when a soft
low voice said, &ldquo;What is puzzling Captain Martin?&mdash;can I be of any
service to him?&rdquo; He turned and saw Kate Henderson.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Only think how fortunate!&rdquo; exclaimed he. &ldquo;Just come in here to this
drawing-room, and give me your advice.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; said she, with a courtesy the more marked because his manner
indicated a seriousness that betokened trouble.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My father has just dismissed me to cogitate over this epistle; as if,
after all, when one has read a letter, that any secret or mystical
interpretation is to come by all the reconsideration and reflection in the
world.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Am I to read it?&rdquo; asked Kate, as he placed it in her hand.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course you are,&rdquo; said he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is nothing confidential or private in it which I ought not to see?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing; and if there were,&rdquo; added he, warmly, &ldquo;<i>you</i> are one of
ourselves, I trust,&mdash;at least <i>I</i> think you so.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kate&rsquo;s lips closed with almost stern % impressiveness, but her color never
changed at this speech, and she opened the letter in silence. For some
minutes she continued to read with the same impassive expression; but
gradually her cheek became paler, and a haughty, almost scornful,
expression settled on her lips. &ldquo;So patient are they in their trials,&rdquo;
 said she, reading aloud the expression of Mary&rsquo;s note. &ldquo;Is it not
possible, Captain Martin, that patience may be pushed a little beyond a
virtue, and become something very like cowardice,&mdash;abject cowardice?
And then,&rdquo; cried she impetuously, and not waiting for his reply, &ldquo;to say
that now is the time to show these poor people the saving care and
protection that the rich owe them, as if the duty dated from the hour of
their being struck down by famine, laid low by pestilence, or that the
debt could ever be acquitted by the relief accorded to pauperism! Why not
have taught these same famished creatures self-dependence, elevated them
to the rank of civilized beings by the enjoyment of rights that give men
self-esteem as well as liberty? What do you mean to do, sir?&mdash;or is
that your difficulty?&rdquo; cried she, hastily changing her tone to one of less
energy.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Exactly,&mdash;that is <i>my difficulty</i>. My father, I suspect, wishes
me to concur in the pleasant project struck out by Mary, and that, by way
of helping <i>them</i>, we should ruin <i>ourselves</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And <i>you</i> are for&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped, as if to let him finish her
question for her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Egad, I don&rsquo;t know well what I&rsquo;m for, except it be self-preservation. I
mean,&rdquo; said he, correcting himself, as a sudden glance of almost insolent
scorn shot from Kate&rsquo;s eyes towards him,&mdash;&ldquo;I mean that I &lsquo;m certain
more than half of this account is sheer exaggeration. Mary is frightened,&mdash;as
well she may be,&mdash;finding herself all alone, and hearing nothing but
the high-colored stories the people brings her, and listening to
calamities from morning to night.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But still it <i>may</i> be all true,&rdquo; said Kate, solemnly. &ldquo;It may be&mdash;as
Miss Martin writes&mdash;that &lsquo;there is a blight on the land.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done, then?&rdquo; asked he, in deep embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The first step is to ascertain what is fact,&mdash;the real extent of the
misfortune.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And how is that to be accomplished?&rdquo; asked he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Can you not think of some means?&rdquo; said she, with a scarcely perceptible
approach to a smile.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, by Jove! that I cannot, except by going over there one&rsquo;s self.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And why not that?&rdquo; asked she, more boldly, while she fixed her large full
eyes directly upon him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If <i>you</i> thought that I ought to go,&mdash;if you advised it and
would actually say &lsquo;Go&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, if I should?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d set off to-night; though, to say truth, neither the journey nor
the business are much to my fancy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Were they ten times less so, sir, I&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;Go,&rsquo;&rdquo; said she, resolutely.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then go I will,&rdquo; cried the Captain; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll start within two hours.&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER VI. MR. MERL&rsquo;S DEPARTURE
</h2>
<p>
Worthy reader, you are neither weak of purpose nor undecided in action; as
little are you easily moved by soft influences, when aided by long
eyelashes. But had you been so, it would have been no difficult effort for
you to comprehend the state of mind in which Captain Martin repaired to
his room to make preparation for his journey. There was a kind of half
chivalry in his present purpose that nerved and supported him. It was like
a knight-errant of old setting out to confront a peril at the behest of
his lady-love; but against this animating conviction there arose that
besetting sin of small minds,&mdash;a sense of distrust,&mdash;a lurking
suspicion that he might be, all this while, nothing but the dupe of a very
artful woman.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who can tell,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;what plan she may have in all this,
or what object she may propose to herself in getting <i>me</i> out of the
way? I don&rsquo;t think she really cares one farthing about the distress of
these people, supposing it all to be true; and as to the typhus fever and
cholera, egad! if they be there, one ought to think twice before rushing
into the midst of them. And then, again, what do I know about the country
or its habits? I have no means of judging if it be poorer or sicklier or;
more wretched than usual. To <i>my</i> eyes, it always seemed at the
lowest depth of want and misery; every one went half starved and more than
half naked. I &lsquo;m sure there is no necessity for my going some few hundred
and odd miles to refresh my memory on this pleasant fact; and yet this is
precisely what I &lsquo;m about to do. Is it by way of trying her power over me?
By Jove, I &lsquo;ve hit it!&rdquo; cried he, suddenly, as he stopped arranging a mass
of letters which he was reducing to order before his departure. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
her game; there&rsquo;s no doubt of it! She has said to herself, &lsquo;This will
prove him. If he do this at my bidding, he&rsquo;ll do more.&rsquo; Ay, but will he,
mademoiselle? that&rsquo;s the question. A young hussar may turn out to be a
very old soldier. What if I were just to tell her so. Girls of her stamp
like a man all the better when he shows himself to be wide-awake. I &lsquo;d lay
a fifty on it she &lsquo;ll care more for me when she sees I &lsquo;m her own equal in
shrewdness. And, after all, why should <i>I</i> go? I could send my valet,
Fletcher,&mdash;just the kind of fellow for such a mission,&mdash;never
knew the secret he could n&rsquo;t worm out; there never was a bit of barrack
scandal he did n&rsquo;t get to the bottom of. He &lsquo;d be back here within a
fortnight, with the whole state of the case, and I&rsquo;ll be bound there will
be no humbugging <i>him</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This bright idea was not, however, without its share of detracting
reflections, for what became of all that personal heroism on which he
reposed such hope, if the danger were to be encountered by deputy? This
was a puzzle, not the less that he had not yet made up his mind whether he
‘d really be in love with Kate Henderson, or only involve <i>her</i> in an
unfortunate attachment for <i>him</i>. While he thus pondered and
hesitated, strewing his room with the contents of drawers and cabinets, by
way of aiding the labor of preparation, his door was suddenly opened, and
Mr. Merl made his appearance. Although dressed with all his habitual
regard to effect, and more than an ordinary display of chains and
trinkets, that gentleman&rsquo;s aspect betokened trouble and anxiety; at least,
there was a certain restlessness in his eye that Martin well understood as
an evidence of something wrong within.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you getting ready for a journey, Captain?&rdquo; asked he, as he entered.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was thinking of it; but I believe I shall not go. I &lsquo;m undecided.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Up the Rhine?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; not in that direction.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;South,&mdash;towards Italy, perhaps?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nor there, either. I was meditating a trip to England.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We should be on the road together,&rdquo; said Merl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off by four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How so? What&rsquo;s the reason of this sudden start?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s going to be a crash here,&rdquo; said Merl, speaking in a lower tone.
&ldquo;The Government have been doing the thing with too high a hand, and
there&rsquo;s mischief brewing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you sure of this?&rdquo; asked Martin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Only too sure, that&rsquo;s all. I bought in, on Tuesday last, at sixty-four
and an eighth, and the same stock is now fifty-one and a quarter, and will
be forty to-morrow. The day after&mdash;&rdquo; Here Mr. Merl made a motion with
his outstretched arm, to indicate utter extinction.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a heavy loser, then?&rdquo; asked Martin, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I shall be, to the tune of some thirteen thousand pounds. It was just on
that account I came in here. I shall need money within the week, and must
turn those Irish securities of yours into cash,&mdash;some of them at
least,&mdash;and I want a hint from you as to which I ought to dispose of
and which hold over. You told me one day, I remember, that there was a
portion of the property likely to rise greatly in value&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>You</i> told me, sir,&rdquo; said Captain Martin, breaking suddenly in,
&ldquo;when I gave you these same bonds, that they should remain in your own
hands, and never leave them. That was the condition on which I gave them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose, Captain, you gave them for something; you did not make a
present of them,&rdquo; said the Jew, coloring slightly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I did not make a present of them,&rdquo; rejoined Martin, &ldquo;the transaction
was about as profitable to me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You owed me the money, sir; that, at least, is the way I regard the
matter.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And when I paid it by these securities, you pledged yourself not to
negotiate them. I explained to you how the entail was settled,&mdash;that
the property must eventually be mine,&mdash;and you accepted the
arrangement on these conditions.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;All true, Captain; but nobody told me, at that time, there was going to
be a revolution in Paris,&mdash;which there will be within forty-eight
hours.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Confounded fool that I was to trust the fellow!&rdquo; said Martin to himself,
but quite loud enough to be heard; then turning to Merl, he said, &ldquo;What do
you mean by converting them into cash? Are you about to sell part of our
estate?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing of the kind, Captain,&rdquo; said Merl, smiling at the innocence of the
question. &ldquo;I am simply going to deposit these where I can obtain an
advance upon them. I promise you, besides, it shall not be in any quarter
by which the transaction can reach the ears of your family. This assurance
will, I trust, satisfy <i>you</i>, and entitle <i>me</i> to the
information I ask for.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What information do you allude to?&rdquo; asked Martin, who had totally
forgotten what the Jew announced as the reason of his visit.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I asked you, Captain,&rdquo; said Merl, resuming the mincing softness of his
usual manner, &ldquo;as to which of these securities might be the more eligible
for immediate negotiation?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And how should I know, sir?&rdquo; replied the other, rudely. &ldquo;I am very little
acquainted with the property itself; I know still less about the kind of
dealings you speak of. It does not concern me in the least what you do, or
how you do it. I believe I may have given you bonds for something very
like double the amount of all you ever advanced to me. I hear of nothing
from my father but the immense resources of this, and the great
capabilities of that; but as these same eventualities are not destined to
better <i>my</i> condition, I have not troubled my head to remember
anything about them. You have a claim of about twenty thousand against
me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thirty-two thousand four hundred and seventy-eight pounds,&rdquo; said the Jew,
reading from a small note-book which he had just taken from his waistcoat
pocket.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is some ten thousand more than ever I heard of,&rdquo; said Martin, with
an hysterical sort of laugh. &ldquo;Egad, Merl, the fellows were right that
would not have you in the &lsquo;Cercle.&rsquo; You &lsquo;d have &lsquo;cleared every man of them
out,&rsquo;&mdash;as well let a ferret into a rabbit warren.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was n&rsquo;t aware,&mdash;I had not heard that I was put up&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure you were; in all form proposed, seconded, and duly
blackballed. I own to you, I thought it very hard, very illiberal. There
are plenty of fellows there that have no right to be particular; and so
Jack Massingbred as much as told them. The fact is, Merl, you ought to
have waited awhile, and by the time that Harlowe and Spencer Cavendish and
a few more such were as deep in your books as I am, you &lsquo;d have had a walk
over. Willoughby says the same. It might have cost you something smart,
but you &lsquo;d have made it pay in the end,&mdash;eh, Merl?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
To this speech, uttered in a strain of jocular impertinence, Merl made no
reply. He had just torn one of his gloves in pieces in the effort to draw
it on, and he was busily exerting himself to get rid of the fragments.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lady Dorothea had given me a card for you for Saturday,&rdquo; resumed the
Captain; &ldquo;but as you &lsquo;re going away&mdash;Besides, after this defeat at
the Club, you could n&rsquo;t well come amongst all these people; so there&rsquo;s
nothing for it but patience, Merl, patience&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A lesson that may be found profitable to others, perhaps,&rdquo; said the Jew,
with one of his furtive looks at the Captain, who quailed under it at
once.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was going to give you a piece of advice, Merl,&rdquo; said he, in a tone the
very opposite to his late bantering one. &ldquo;It was, that you should just
take a run over to Ireland yourself, and see the property.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I mean to do so, Captain Martin,&rdquo; said the other, calmly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t offer you letters, for they would defeat what you desire to
accomplish; besides, there is no member of the family there at present but
a young lady-cousin of mine.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just the kind of introduction I &lsquo;d like,&rdquo; said the Jew, with all the zest
of a man glad to say what he knew would be deemed an impertinence.
</p>
<p>
Martin grew crimson with suppressed anger, but never spoke a word.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is this the Cousin Mary I have heard you speak of,&rdquo; said Merl,&mdash;&ldquo;the
great horsewoman, and she that ventures out alone on the Atlantic in a
mere skiff?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Martin nodded. His temper was almost an overmatch for him, and he dared
not trust himself to speak.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should like to see her amazingly, Captain,&rdquo; resumed Merl.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Remember, sir, you have no lien upon <i>her</i>,&rdquo; said Martin, sternly.
</p>
<p>
The Jew smirked and ran his fingers through his hair with the air of one
who deemed such an eventuality by no means so very remote.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you know, Master Merl,&rdquo; said Martin, staring at him from head to foot
with an expression the reverse of complimentary, &ldquo;I &lsquo;m half disposed to
give you a few lines to my cousin; and if you &lsquo;ll not take the thing as a
<i>mauvais plaisanterie</i> on my part, I will do so.&rdquo;. &ldquo;Quite the
contrary, Captain. I &lsquo;ll deem it a great favor, indeed,&rdquo; said Merl, with
an admirable affectation of unconsciousness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here goes, then,&rdquo; said Martin, sitting down to a table, and preparing his
writing materials, while in a hurried hand he began:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear Cousin Mary,&mdash;This will introduce to you Mr. Herman Merl, who
visits your remote regions on a tour of&mdash;&mdash;What shall I say?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pleasure,&mdash;amusement,&rdquo; interposed Merl.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, when I <i>am</i> telling a fib, I like a big one,&mdash;I &lsquo;ll say,
philanthropy, Merl; and there&rsquo;s nothing so well adapted to cover those
secret investigations you are bent upon,&mdash;a tour of philanthropy.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;You will, I am sure, lend him all possible assistance in his benevolent
object,&mdash;the same being to dispose of the family acres,&mdash;and at
the same time direct his attention to whatever may be matter of interest,&mdash;whether
mines, quarries, or other property easily convertible into cash,&mdash;treating
him in all respects as one to whom I owe many obligations&mdash;and
several thousand pounds.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will that do, think you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perfectly; nothing better.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;In return, I shall ask one favor at your hands,&rdquo; said Martin, as he
folded and addressed the epistle. &ldquo;It is that you write me a full account
of what you see in the West,&mdash;how the country looks, and the people.
Of course it will all seem terribly poor and destitute, and all that sort
of thing, to your eyes; but just try and find out if it be worse than
usual. Paddy is such a shrewd fellow, Merl, that it will require all your
own sharpness not to be taken in by him. A long letter full of detail&mdash;a
dash of figures in it&mdash;as to how many sheep have the rot, or how many
people have caught the fever, will improve it,&mdash;you know the kind of
thing I mean; and&mdash;I don&rsquo;t suppose you care about shooting, yourself,
but you &lsquo;ll get some one to tell you&mdash;are the birds plenty and in
good condition. There&rsquo;s a certain Mr. Scanlan, if you chance upon him; he
‘s up to everything, and not a bad performer at dummy whist,&mdash;though
I think <i>you</i> could teach him a thing or two.&rdquo; Merl smiled and tried
to look flattered, while the other went on: &ldquo;And there &lsquo;s another, called
Henderson,&mdash;the steward,&mdash;a very shrewd person,&mdash;but <i>you</i>
don&rsquo;t need all these particulars; you may be trusted to your own good
guidance,&mdash;eh, Merl?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Merl again smiled in the same fashion as before; in fact, so completely
had he resumed the bland expression habitual to him, that the Captain
almost forgot the unpleasant cause of his visit, and all the disagreeable
incidents of the interview.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You could n&rsquo;t give me a few lines to this Mr. Scanlan?&rdquo; asked Merl, with
an air of easy indifference.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing easier,&rdquo; cried the Captain, reseating himself; then suddenly
rising, with the expression of one to whom a sudden thought had just
crossed the mind, &ldquo;Wait one second for me here, Merl; I&rsquo;ll be back with
you at once.&rdquo; And as he spoke he dashed out of the room, and hastened to
his father.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;By a rare piece of luck,&rdquo; cried he, as he entered, &ldquo;I &lsquo;ve just chanced
upon the very fellow we want; an acquaintance I picked up at the Cape,&mdash;up
to everything; he goes over to Ireland to-night, and he &lsquo;ll take a run
down to Cro&rsquo; Martin, and send us his report of all he sees. Whatever he
tells us may be relied upon; for, depend upon &lsquo;t, no lady can humbug <i>him</i>.
I &lsquo;ve just given him a note for Mary, and I &lsquo;ll write a few lines also by
way of introducing him to Scanlan.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Martin could barely follow the Captain, as with rapid utterance he poured
forth this plan. &ldquo;Do I know him? What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; asked he at last.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You never saw him. His name is Merl,&mdash;Herman Merl,&mdash;a fellow of
considerable wealth; a great speculator,&mdash;one of those Stock Exchange
worthies who never deal in less than tens of thousands. He has a crotchet
in his head about buying up half the West of Ireland,&mdash;some scheme
about flax and the deep-sea fishery. I don&rsquo;t understand it, but I suppose
<i>he</i> does. At all events, he has plenty of money, and the head to
make it fructify; and if he only take a liking to it, he &lsquo;s the very
fellow to buy up Kilkieran, and the islands, and the rest of that waste
district you were telling me of t&rsquo;other night. But I must n&rsquo;t detain him.
He starts at four o&rsquo;clock; and I only ran over here to tell you not to
worry yourself any more about Mary&rsquo;s letter. He &lsquo;ll look to it all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And with this consolatory assurance the Captain hastened away, leaving
Martin as much relieved in mind as an indolent nature and an easy
conscience were sure to make him. To get anybody &ldquo;to look to&rdquo; anything had
been his whole object in life; to know that, whatever happened, there was
always somebody who misstated this, or neglected that, at whose door all
the culpability&mdash;where there was such&mdash;could be laid and but for
whom he had himself performed miracles of energy and devotedness, and
endured all the tortures and trials of a martyr. He was, indeed, as are a
great many others in this world, an excellent man to his own heart,&mdash;kind,
charitable, and affectionate; a well-wisher to his kind, and hopeful of
almost every one; but, all this while, his virtues, like a miser&rsquo;s gold,
had no circulation; they remained locked up within him for his own use
alone, and there he sat, counting them over and gazing at them,
speculating upon all that this affluence could do, and&mdash;never doing
it!
</p>
<p>
Life abounds with such men. They win respect while they live, and white
marble records their virtues when they die! Nor are they all useless.
Their outward bearing at least simulates whatever we revere in good men,
and we accept them in the same spirit of compromise as we take stucco for
stone; if they do no more, they show our appreciation of the &ldquo;real
article.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The Captain was not long in inditing a short note to Scanlan, to whom,
&ldquo;strictly confidential,&rdquo; Mr. Merl was introduced as a great capitalist and
speculator, desirous to ascertain all the resources of the land. Scanlan
was enjoined to show him every attention, making his visit in all respects
as agreeable as possible.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;This fellow will treat you well, Merl,&rdquo; said the Captain, as he folded
the letter; &ldquo;will give you the best salmon you ever tasted, and a glass of
Gordon&rsquo;s Madeira such as few could sport now-a-days. And if you have a
fancy for a day with my Cousin Mary&rsquo;s hounds, he &lsquo;ll mount you admirably,
and show you the way besides.&rdquo; And with this speech Martin wished him
good-bye; and closing the door after him, added, &ldquo;And if he&rsquo;ll kindly
assist you to a broken neck, it&rsquo;s about the greatest service he could
render me!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The laugh, silly and meaningless, that followed his utterance of this
speech, showed that it was spoken in all the listlessness of one who had
not really character enough to be even a &ldquo;good hater.&rdquo;
 </p>

<h2>
CHAPTER VII. THE CLUB
</h2>
<p>
So little impression had Merl&rsquo;s gloomy forebodings made upon Captain
Martin, that he actually forgot everything that this shrewd gentleman
predicted, and only partially recalled them when the conversation the next
morning at the Club turned on the disturbed state of the capital. People
in &ldquo;society&rdquo; find it excessively difficult to believe in anything like an
organized opposition to the authorities of a government. They are so
accustomed to hear of street assemblages being scattered by a few
soldiers, mobs routed by a handful of mounted policemen, that they are
slow to imagine how any formidable movement can take its rise in such a
source. But the maladies of states, like those of the human frame, are
often mere trifles in their origin; chance, and the concurrence of events
swell their importance, till they assume an aspect of perhaps greater
menace than they deserve. This is essentially the case in revolutionary
struggles, where, at the outset, none ever contemplates the extent to
which the mischief may reach. The proclamation of the &ldquo;Ordinances,&rdquo; as
they were called, had produced a great excitement in Paris. Groups of men
in every street were gathered around some one reading aloud the violent
commentaries of the public papers; thoughtful and stern faces were met at
every corner; a look of expectancy&mdash;an expression that seemed to say,
What next?&mdash;was perceptible on all sides. Many of the shops were half
closed, and in some the objects of great value were withdrawn to places of
greater security. It was clear to see that men apprehended some great
crisis; but whence it should come, or by whose instrumentality promoted,
none seemed able to guess. Now and then a mounted orderly would ride by at
a smart trot, or a patrol party of dragoons dash past; and the significant
glance that followed them indicated how full of meaning these signs
appeared.
</p>
<p>
The day passed in this state of anxious uncertainty; and although the
journals discussed the condition of the capital as full of danger and
menace, an ostentatious announcement in the &ldquo;Moniteur&rdquo; proclaimed Paris to
be tranquil. In society&mdash;at least in the world of fashion and high
life&mdash;there were very few who would have disputed the official
despatch. &ldquo;Who and what were they who could dispute the King&rsquo;s Government?
Who and where were there either leaders or followers? In what way should
they attempt it? The troops in and around Paris numbered something over
forty thousand, commanded by an old Marshal of the Empire, now the
trustiest adherent of royalty. The days of Mirabeaus and Robespierres and
Dantons had passed away; nor were these times in which men would like to
recall the reigns of terror and the guillotine.&rdquo; So they reasoned&mdash;or,
if the phrase be too strong, so they talked&mdash;who lounged on
soft-cushioned ottomans, or moved listlessly over luxurious carpets; all
agreeing that it would be treasonable in the Ministers to retreat or abate
one jot of the high prerogative of the Crown. Powdered heads shook
significantly, and gold-embroidered vests heaved indignantly at the bare
thought that the old spirit of &lsquo;95 should have survived amongst them; but
not one dreamed that the event boded seriously, or that the destinies of a
great nation were then in the balance.
</p>
<p>
It is but five-and-twenty years ago; and how much more have we learned of
the manufacture of revolutions in the interval! Barricades and street
warfare have become a science, and the amount of resistance a half-armed
populace can offer to a regular force is as much a matter of certainty as
a mathematical theorem. At that period, however, men were but in the
infancy of this knowledge; the traditions of the Great Revolution scarcely
were remembered, and, for the most part, they were inapplicable.
</p>
<p>
What wonder, then, if people in society smiled scornfully at the
purposeless masses that occasionally moved past beneath their windows,
shouting with discordant voices some fragments of the &ldquo;Marseillaise,&rdquo; or,
as they approached the residence of any in authority, venturing on the
more daring cry of &ldquo;Down with the Ordinances!&rdquo; The same tone of haughty
contempt pervaded the &ldquo;Club.&rdquo; Young men of fashion, little given to the
cares of political life, and really indifferent to the action of laws
which never invaded the privileges of the play-table, or curtailed one
prerogative of the &ldquo;Coulisses,&rdquo; felt an angry impatience at all the
turbulence and riot of the public streets.
</p>
<p>
In a magnificently furnished salon of the Club a number of these young men
were now assembled. Gathered from every nation of Europe,&mdash;many of
them bearing names of high historical interest,&mdash;they were, so far as
dress, air, and appearance went, no ignoble representatives of the class
they belonged to. The proud and haughty Spaniard, the fierce-eyed,
daring-looking Pole, the pale, intellectual-faced Italian, the courteous
Russian, and the fair-haired, stalwart Saxon were all there; and, however
dissimilar in type, banded together by the magic influence of the &ldquo;set&rdquo;
 they moved in, to an almost perfect uniformity of sentiment and opinion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I vote that any man be fined ten Louis that alludes, however remotely, to
this confounded question again,&rdquo; cried Count Gardoni, rising impatiently
from his chair and approaching a card-table.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I second you!&rdquo; exclaimed a Polish prince, with a Russian decoration
at his button-hole.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Carried <i>nem. con.</i>&rdquo; said Captain Martin, seating himself at the
play-table. &ldquo;And now for the &lsquo;Lansquenet.&rsquo;&rdquo; And in a moment every seat was
occupied, and purses of gold and pocket-books of bank-notes were strewed
over the board. They were all men who played high; and the game soon
assumed the grave character that so invariably accompanies large wagers.
Wonderfully little passed, except the terms of the game itself. Gambling
is a jealous passion, and never admits its votaries to wander in their
attention. And now large sums passed from hand to hand, and all the
passions of hope and fear racked heads and hearts around, while a decorous
silence prevailed; or, when broken, some softly toned voice alone
interrupted the stillness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you going, Martin?&rdquo; whispered the young French Count de Nevers, as
the other moved noiselessly back from the table.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is high time, I think,&rdquo; said Martin; &ldquo;this is my seventeenth night of
losing,&mdash;losing heavily, too. I&rsquo;m sick of it!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here &lsquo;s a chance for you, Martin,&rdquo; said a Russian prince, who had just
assumed &ldquo;the bank.&rdquo; &ldquo;You shall have your choice of color, and your own
stake.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thanks; but I&rsquo;ll not be tempted.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I say red, and a thousand francs,&rdquo; cried a Neapolitan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There &lsquo;s heavier play outside, I suspect,&rdquo; said Martin, as a wild, hoarse
shout from the streets re-echoed through the room.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A fine,&mdash;a fine,&mdash;Martin is fined!&rdquo; cried several around the
table.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have n&rsquo;t left me wherewithal to pay it, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he,
laughing. &ldquo;I was just about to retire, a bankrupt, into private life.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s platoon fire,&rdquo; exclaimed the Pole, as the loud detonation of small
arms seemed to shake the very room.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Czernavitz also fined,&rdquo; cried two together.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I bow in submission to the Court,&rdquo; said the Pole, throwing down the money
on the table.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lend <i>me</i> as much more,&rdquo; said Martin; &ldquo;it may change my luck.&rdquo; And
with this gambler&rsquo;s philosophy, he again drew nigh the table.
</p>
<p>
This slight interruption over, the game proceeded as before. Martin,
however, was now a winner, every wager succeeding, and every bet he made a
gain.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like a dogged persistence,&rdquo; said the Russian. &ldquo;Fortune
never turns her back on him who shows constancy. See Martin, now; by that
very resolution he has conquered, and here we are, all cleared out!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am, for one,&rdquo; cried an Italian, flinging his empty purse on the table.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my last Louis,&rdquo; said Nevers. &ldquo;I reserve it to pay for my supper.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Martin shall treat us all to supper!&rdquo; exclaimed another.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where shall it be, then?&rdquo; said Martin; &ldquo;here, or at my own quarters?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here, by all means,&rdquo; cried some.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;m for the Place Vendôme,&rdquo; said the Pole, &ldquo;for who knows but we shall
catch a glimpse of that beautiful girl, Martin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Belle Irlandaise.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I saw her to-night,&rdquo; said the Italian, &ldquo;and I own she <i>is</i> all you
say. She was speaking to Villemart, and I assure you the old Minister
won&rsquo;t forget it in a hurry. Something or other he said about the noise in
the street drew from him the word <i>canaille</i>. She turned round at
once and attacked him. He replied, and the controversy grew warm; so much
so, that many gathered around them to listen, amongst whom I saw the Duc
de Guiche, Prince du Saulx, and the Austrian Minister. Nothing could be
more perfect than her manner,&mdash;calm, without any effrontery; assured,
and yet no sacrifice of delicacy. It was easy to see, too, that the theme
was not one into which she stumbled by an accident; she knew every event
of the Great Revolution, and used the knowledge with consummate skill,
and, but for one slip, with consummate temper also.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What was the slip you allude to?&rdquo; cried the Russian.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was when Villemart, after a boastful enumeration of the superior
merits of his order, called them the &lsquo;Enlighteners of the People.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;You played that part on one occasion,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;but I scarcely thought
you &lsquo;d like to refer to it.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;How so? When do you mean?&rsquo; asked he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;When they hung you to the lanterns,&rsquo; said she, with the energy of a
tigress in her look. Pardié! at that moment I never saw anything so
beautiful or so terrible.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A loud uproar in the street without, in which the sound of troop-horses
passaging to and fro could be distinguished, now interrupted the colloquy.
As the noise increased, a low, deep roar, like the sound of distant
thunder, could be heard, and the Pole cried out,&mdash;&ldquo;Messieurs les
Sans-culottes, I strongly advise you to turn homewards, for, if I be not
much mistaken, here comes the artillery.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The affair may turn out a serious one, after all,&rdquo; broke in the Italian.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A serious one!&rdquo; echoed the Pole, scornfully. &ldquo;How can it? Forty
battalions of infantry, ten thousand sabres, and eight batteries; are they
not enough, think you, to rout this contemptible herd of street rioters?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&mdash;listen! It has begun already!&rdquo; exclaimed Martin, as the sharp
report of fire-arms, quite close to the windows, was followed by a crash,
and then a wild, mad shout, half rage, half defiance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing for it, in these things, but speedy action,&rdquo; said the
Pole; &ldquo;grape and cavalry charges to clear the streets, and rifle practice
at anything that shows itself at the windows.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is so easy, so very easy, to crush a mob,&rdquo; said the Russian, &ldquo;if you
only direct your attention to the leader,&mdash;think of nothing but <i>him</i>.
Once you show that, whatever may be the fate of others, death must be his,
the whole assemblage becomes a disorganized, unwieldy mass, to be sabred
or shot down at pleasure.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Soldiers have no fancy for this kind of warfare,&rdquo; said De Nevers,
haughtily; &ldquo;victory is never glorious, defeat always humiliation.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But who talks of defeat?&rdquo; exclaimed the Pole, passionately. &ldquo;The officer
who could fail against such an enemy should be shot by a court-martial. We
have, I believe, every man of us here, served; and I asked you, what
disproportion of force could suggest a doubt of success?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
As he spoke, the door of the room was suddenly opened, and a young man,
with dress all disordered, and the fragment of a hat in his hand, entered.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What, Massingbred!&rdquo; cried one, &ldquo;how came you to be so roughly handled?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So much for popular politeness!&rdquo; exclaimed the Russian, as he took up the
tattered remains of a dress-coat, and exhibited it to the others.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pardon me, Prince,&rdquo; replied Massingbred, as he filled a glass of water
and drank it off, &ldquo;this courtesy I received at the hands of the military.
I was turning my cab from the Boulevard to enter this street, when a
hoarse challenge of a sentry, saying I know not what, attracted my
attention. I drew up short to learn, and then suddenly came a rush of the
people from behind, which terrified my horse, and set him off at speed;
the uproar increasing, the affrighted animal dashed madly onward, the
crowd flying on every side, when suddenly a bullet whizzed past my head,
cutting my hat in two; a second, at the same instant, struck my horse, and
killed him on the spot, cab and all rolling over as he fell. How I arose,
gained my legs, and was swept away by the dense torrent of the populace,
are events of which I am very far from clear. I only know that although
the occurrence happened within half an hour ago, it seems to <i>me</i> an
affair of days since.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You were, doubtless, within some line of outposts when first challenged,&rdquo;
 said the Pole, &ldquo;and the speed at which you drove was believed to be an
arranged plan of attack, for you say the mob followed you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very possibly your explanation is the correct one,&rdquo; said Massingbred,
coolly; &ldquo;but I looked for more steadiness and composure from the troops,
while I certainly did not anticipate so much true courtesy and kindness as
I met with from the people.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Parbleu! here&rsquo;s Massingbred becoming Democrat,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;The next thing
we shall hear is his defence of a barricade.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll assuredly not hear that I attacked one in such company as
inflicted all this upon me,&rdquo; rejoined he, with an easy smile.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the man to captivate your &lsquo;Belle Irlandaise,&rsquo; Martin,&rdquo; cried one.
&ldquo;Already is he a hero and a martyr to Royal cruelty.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah! you came too late to hear that,&rdquo; said the Pole, in a whisper to
Massingbred; &ldquo;but it seems La Henderson became quite a Charlotte Corday
this evening, and talked more violent Republicanism than has been heard in
a salon since the days of old Égalité.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;All lights must be extinguished, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the waiter, entering
hastily. &ldquo;The street is occupied by troops, and you must pass out by the
Rue de Grenelle.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are the mobs not dispersing, then?&rdquo; asked the Russian.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, your Highness. They have beaten back the troops from the Quai
Voltaire, and are already advancing on the Louvre.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What absurdity!&rdquo; exclaimed the Pole. &ldquo;If the troops permit this, there is
treason amongst them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can answer for it there is terror, at least,&rdquo; said Massingbred. &ldquo;All
the high daring and spirit is with what you would call the Sans-culottes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That a man should talk this way because he has lost a cab-horse!&rdquo; cried
the Pole, insolently.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There are men who can bear the loss of a country with more equanimity,&mdash;I
know that,&rdquo; whispered Massingbred in his ear, with all the calm sternness
of an insult.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You mean this for <i>me?</i>&rdquo; said the Pole, in a low voice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; was the answer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where?&mdash;when?&mdash;how?&rdquo; muttered the Pole, in suppressed passion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I leave all at your disposal,&rdquo; said Massingbred, smiling at the other&rsquo;s
effort to control his rage.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;At Versailles,&mdash;to-morrow morning,&mdash;pistols.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Massingbred bowed, and turned away. At the same instant the waiter entered
to say that the house must be cleared at once, or all within it consent to
remain close prisoners.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come along, Martin,&rdquo; said Massingbred, taking his arm. &ldquo;I shall want you
to do me a favor. Let us make our escape by the Rue de Grenelle, and I &lsquo;ll
engage to pilot you safely to your own quarters.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Has anything passed between you and Czernavitz?&rdquo; asked Martin, as they
gained the street.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A slight exchange of civilities which requires an exchange of shots,&rdquo;
 said Jack, calmly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;By George! I &lsquo;m sorry for it. He can hit a franc-piece at thirty paces.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So can I, Martin; and, what&rsquo;s more, Anatole knows it. He&rsquo;s as brave as a
lion, and it is my confounded skill has pushed him on to this
provocation.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He &lsquo;ll shoot you,&rdquo; muttered Martin, in a half revery.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not impossible,&rdquo; said Massingbred. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fellow who cannot conceal his
emotions, and will show at once what he means to do.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, what of that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Simply, that if he intends mischief I shall know it, and send a bullet
through his heart.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Little as Martin had seen of Massingbred,&mdash;they were but Club
acquaintances of a few weeks back,&mdash;he believed that he was one of
those smart, versatile men who, with abundance of social ability, acquire
reputation for higher capacity than they possess; but, above all, he never
gave him credit for anything like a settled purpose or a stern resolution.
It was, then, with considerable astonishment that he now heard him avow
this deadly determination with all the composure that could vouch for its
sincerity. There was, however, little time to think of these things. The
course they were driven to follow, by by-streets and alleys, necessitated
a long and difficult way. The great thoroughfares which they crossed at
intervals were entirely in the possession of the troops, who challenged
them as they approached, and only suffered them to proceed when well
satisfied with their account. The crowds had all dispersed, and to the
late din and tumult there had succeeded the deep silence of a city sunk in
sleep, only broken by the hoarse call of the sentinels, or the distant
tramp of a patrol.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is all over, I suppose,&rdquo; said Martin. &ldquo;The sight of the eight-pounders
and the dark caissons has done the work.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said Massingbred, &ldquo;nor do the troops think so. These
mobs are not like ours in England, who, with plenty of individual courage,
are always poltroons in the mass. These fellows understand fighting as an
art, know how to combine their movements, arrange the modes of attack or
defence, can measure accurately the means of resistance opposed to them,
and, above all, understand how to be led,&mdash;something far more
difficult than it seems. In <i>my</i> good borough of Oughterard,&mdash;or
yours, rather, Martin, for I have only a loan of it,&mdash;a few soldiers&mdash;the
army, as they would call them&mdash;would sweep the whole population
before them. Our countrymen can get up a row, these fellows can accomplish
a revolt,&mdash;there&rsquo;s the difference.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And have they any real, substantial grievance that demands such an
expiation?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; said he, laughingly. &ldquo;There never was a Government too bad to
live under,&mdash;there never was one exempt from great vices. Half the
political disturbances the world has witnessed have arisen from causes
remote from State Government; a deficient harvest, a dear loaf, the
liberty of the Press invaded,&mdash;a tyranny always resented by those who
can&rsquo;t read,&mdash;are common causes enough. But here we are now at the
Place Vendôme, and certainly one should say the odds are against the
people.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Massingbred said truly. Two battalions of infantry, with a battery of guns
in position, were flanked by four squadrons of Cuirassiers, the formidable
array filling the entire &ldquo;Place,&rdquo; and showing by their air and attitude
their readiness for any eventuality. A chance acquaintance with one of the
staff enabled Massingbred and Martin to pass through their lines and
arrive at their hotel.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; said the officer who accompanied them, &ldquo;that you are close
prisoners now. My orders are that nobody is to leave the Place under any
pretext.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, you can scarcely suspect that the Government has enemies in this
aristocratic quarter?&rdquo; said Massingbred, smiling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We have them everywhere,&rdquo; was the brief answer, as he bowed and turned
away.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I scarcely see how I&rsquo;m to keep my appointment at Versailles to-morrow
morning,&rdquo; said Massingbred, as he followed Martin up the spacious stairs.
&ldquo;Happily, Czernavitz knows me, and will not misinterpret my absence.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not to say that he may be unable himself to get there,&rdquo; said Martin. As
he spoke, they had reached the door, opening which with his key, the
Captain motioned to Massingbred to enter.
</p>
<p>
Massingbred stopped suddenly, and in a voice of deep meaning said, &ldquo;Your
father lives here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;what then?&rdquo; asked Martin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Only that I have no right to pass his threshold,&rdquo; said the other, in a
low voice. &ldquo;I was his guest once, and I &lsquo;m not sure that I repaid the
hospitality as became me. You were away at the time.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You allude to that stupid election affair,&rdquo; said Martin. &ldquo;I can only say
that I never did, never could understand it. My only feeling was one of
gratitude to you for saving me from being member for the borough. Come
along,&rdquo; said he, taking his arm; &ldquo;this is no time for your scruples, at
all events.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, Martin, I cannot,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I &lsquo;d rather walk up to one of
those nine-pounders there than present myself to your lady-mother&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But you needn&rsquo;t. You are <i>my</i> guest; these are <i>my</i> quarters.
You shall see nobody but myself till you leave this. Remember what the
Captain told us; we are prisoners here.&rdquo; And without waiting for a reply,
Martin pushed him before him into the room.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Two o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Massingbred, looking at his watch; &ldquo;and we are to be
at Versailles by eight.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, leave all the care of that to me,&rdquo; said Martin; &ldquo;and do you throw
yourself on the bed there, and take some rest. Without you prefer to sup
first?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, an hour&rsquo;s sleep is what I stand most in need of; and so I &lsquo;ll say
good-night.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Massingbred said this less that he wanted repose than a brief interval to
be alone with his own thoughts. And now, as he closed his eyes to affect
sleep, it was really to commune with his own heart, and reflect over what
had just occurred.
</p>
<p>
Independently that he liked Czernavitz personally, he was sorry for a
quarrel at such a moment. There was a great game about to be played, and a
mere personal altercation seemed something small and contemptible in the
face of such events. &ldquo;What will be said of us,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;but that we
were a pair of hot-headed fools, thinking more of a miserable interchange
of weak sarcasms than of the high destinies of a whole nation? And it was
<i>my</i> fault,&rdquo; added he to himself; &ldquo;I had no right to reproach him
with a calamity hard enough to bear, even without its being a reproach.
What a strange thing is life, after all!&rdquo; thought he; &ldquo;everything of
greatest moment that occurs in it the upshot of an accident,&mdash;my
going to Ireland, my visit to the West, my election, my meeting with Kate
Henderson, and now this duel.&rdquo; And, so ruminating, he dropped off into a
sound sleep, undisturbed by sounds that might well have broken the
heaviest slumber.

<h2>
CHAPTER VIII. AN EVENING OF ONE OP THE &ldquo;THREE DAYS&rdquo;
 </h2>
<p>
On the evening which witnessed these events Lady Dorothea&rsquo;s &ldquo;reception&rdquo;
 had been more than usually brilliant. Numbers had come to show of how
little moment they deemed this &ldquo;street disturbance,&rdquo; as they were pleased
to call it; others, again, were curious to pick up in society the opinions
formed on what was passing, among whom were several high in the favor of
the Court and the confidence of the Government. All, as they arrived, had
some little anecdote or adventure to relate as to the difficulties which
beset them on the way,&mdash;the distances which they were obliged to
travel, the obstructions and passwords and explanations which met them at
every turn. These were all narrated in the easy, jocular tone of passing
trifles, the very inconvenience of which suggested its share of amusement.
</p>
<p>
As the evening wore on, even these became less frequent; the streets were
already thinning, and, except in some remote, unimportant parts of the
capital, the troops were in possession of all the thoroughfares. Of
course, the great topic of conversation was the bold stroke of policy then
enacting,&mdash;a measure which all pronounced wise and just, and
eminently called for.
</p>
<p>
To have heard the sentiments then uttered, the disparaging opinions
expressed of the middle and humbler classes, the hopelessness of ever
seeing them sufficiently impressed with their own inferiority, the
adulation bestowed on the monarch and all around him, one might really
have fancied himself back again at the Tuileries in the time of Louis the
Fourteenth. All agreed in deeming the occasion an excellent one to give
the people a salutary lesson; and it was really pleasant to see the warm
interest taken by these high and distinguished persons in the fortunes of
their less happy countrymen.
</p>
<p>
To Lady Dorothea&rsquo;s ears no theme could be more grateful; and she moved
from group to group, delighted to mingle her congratulations with those
around, and exchange her hopes and aspirations and wishes with theirs.
Kate Henderson, upon whom habitually devolved the chief part in these
&ldquo;receptions,&rdquo; was excited and flurried in manner; a more than ordinary
effort to please being dashed, as it were, by some secret anxiety, and the
expectation of some coming event. Had there been any one to watch her
movements, he might have seen the eagerness with which she listened to
each new account of the state of the capital, and how impatiently she
drank in the last tidings from the streets; nor less marked was the
expression of proud scorn upon her features, as she heard the insulting
estimate of the populace, and the vainglorious confidence in the soldiery.
But more than all these was her haughty indignation as she listened to the
confused, mistaken opinions uttered on every side as to the policy of the
Government and the benevolent intentions of the king. Once, and only once,
did she forget the prudent resolve she wished to impose upon herself; but
temper and caution and reserve gave way, as she heard a very distinguished
person amusing a circle around him by an unfair and unfaithful portraiture
of the great leaders of &lsquo;92. It was then, when stung by the odious epithet
of <i>canaille</i> applied to those for whose characters she entertained a
deep devotion, that she forgot everything, and in a burst of indignant
eloquence overwhelmed and refuted the speaker. This was the moment, too,
in which she replied to Villemart by a word of terrible ferocity. Had the
red cap of Liberty itself been suddenly hoisted in that brilliant
assemblage, the dread and terror which arose could scarcely have been
greater.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; cried the Marquise de Longueville. &ldquo;I thought we were in
the Place de Vendôme, and I find myself in the Faubourg St. Antoine!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Does my Lady know that her friend and confidante is a Girondist of the
first water?&rdquo; said an ex-Minister.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who could have suspected the spirit of Marat under the mask of Ninon de
l&rsquo;Enclos?&rdquo; muttered Villemart.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What is this I hear, dearest Kate?&rdquo; cried the Duchesse de Mirecourt, as
she drew the young girl&rsquo;s arm within her own. &ldquo;They tell me you have
terrified every one,&mdash;that Madame de Soissons has gone home ill, and
the old Chevalier de Gardonnes has sent for his confessor.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have been very rash, very foolish,&rdquo; said Kate, as a deadly pallor came
over her; &ldquo;but I could bear it no longer. Besides, what does it matter?
They &lsquo;ll hear worse, and bear it too, before three days are over.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then it is all true?&rdquo; cried the Duchess, eagerly. &ldquo;You told Villemart
that when the Government spoke with grape-shot, the people replied with
the guillotine!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; said Kate, with a faint smile. &ldquo;But are they all going?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course they are. You have frightened them almost to death; and I know
you only meant it for jest,&mdash;one of those little half-cruel jests you
were ever fond of. Come with me and say so,&mdash;come, dearest.&rdquo; And she
drew her, as she spoke, into the crowded salon, now already a scene of
excited leave-taking. The brilliant company, however, fell back as they
came forward, and an expression of mingled dismay and compassion was
turned towards the young Duchess, who with a kind of heroic courage drew
Kate&rsquo;s arm closer within her own.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am come to make an explanation, messieurs et mesdames,&rdquo; said the
Duchess, with her most captivating smile; &ldquo;pray vouchsafe me a hearing. My
friend&mdash;my dearest, best friend here&mdash;has, in a moment of
sportive pleasantry, suffered herself to jest&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was a jest, then?&rdquo; broke in Madame de Longueville, haughtily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just as that is,&rdquo; replied Kate, lifting her hand and pointing in the
direction whence came a terrible crash of artillery, followed by the
rattle of musketry.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let us go,&mdash;let us away!&rdquo; was now heard in affrighted accents on
every side; and the splendid assemblage, with less of ceremony than might
be expected, began to depart. Lady Dorothea alone was ignorant of what had
occurred, and witnessed this sudden leave-taking with amazement. &ldquo;You are
surely not afraid?&rdquo; said she to one; &ldquo;there is nothing serious in all
this.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She has told us the reverse, my Lady,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;We should be
compromised to remain longer in her company.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Adieu, my Lady. I wish we left you in safer companionship.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Farewell, Madame, and pray be warned of your danger,&rdquo; whispered another.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your Ladyship may be called upon to acquit debts contracted by another,
if Mademoiselle continues a member of your family,&rdquo; said Villemart, as he
bowed his departure.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Believe me, Madame, none of us include <i>you</i> in the terrible
sentiments we have listened to.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
These, and a vast number of similar speeches attended the leave-taking of
nearly each of her guests, till Lady Dorothea, confused, almost stunned by
reiterated shocks, sat silently accepting these mysterious announcements,
and almost imagining herself in all the bewilderment of a dream.
</p>
<p>
Twice she made an effort to ask some explanation, but failed; and it was
only as the Duchesse de Mirecourt drew nigh to say farewell, that in a
faint, weak voice she said,&mdash;&ldquo;Can you tell me what all are hinting
at, or am I only confusing myself with the terrible scenes without?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;d have prevented it had I been near. I only heard it when too late, my
Lady,&rdquo; said the Duchess, sorrowfully.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Prevented what?&mdash;heard what?&rdquo; cried Lady Dorothea.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Besides, she has often said as much amongst ourselves; we only laughed,
as indeed every one would do now, did not events present so formidable an
aspect.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who is she you speak of? Tell me, I beseech you. What does this mean?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am the culprit, my Lady,&rdquo; said Kate, approaching with all the quiet
stateliness of her peculiar manner. &ldquo;I have routed this gorgeous assembly,
shocked your most distinguished guests, and horrified all whose sentiments
breathe loyalty! I am sincerely sorry for my offence; and it is a grave
one.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>You&mdash;you</i> have dared to do this?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Too true, madam,&rdquo; rejoined Kate.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How and to whom have you had the insolence&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She stopped, overcome by passion; and Kate replied,&mdash;&ldquo;To all who
pleased to listen, my Lady, I have said what doubtless is not often
uttered in such choice company, but what, if I mistake not greatly, their
ears will grow familiar with erelong.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; said the Duchess, in a tone of apology, &ldquo;the matter is not so
serious as all this. Every one now is terrified. This disturbance, the
soldiery, the vast crowds that beset the streets, have all produced so
much excitement that even a few words spoken at random are enough to cause
fear. It is one of Kate&rsquo;s fancies to terrorize thus over weak minds. She
has the cruel triumph of not knowing what fear is. In a word, it is a mere
trifling event, sure to be forgotten in the midst of such scenes as we are
passing through.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This attempt at explanation, poured forth with rapid utterance, did not
produce on Lady Dorothea the conviction it was intended to impose, and her
Ladyship received the last adieus of the Duchess with a cold and stately
formality; and then, as the door closed after her, turned to Kate
Henderson, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;I want <i>your</i> explanation of all this.
Let me have it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is easily given, my Lady,&rdquo; said Kate, calmly. And then, in a voice
that never trembled nor varied, she narrated briefly the scene which had
just occurred, not extenuating in the slightest her own share in the
transaction, or offering a single syllable of excuse.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you, being who and what you are, dared thus to outrage the best blood
of France!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Dorothea, trembling all over with passion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps, my Lady, if I sought for an apology, it would be in the fact of
being who and what I am.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And do you imagine that after conduct such as this, after exposing me to
a partnership in the shame that attaches to yourself, that you are any
longer to enjoy the shelter of my roof?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It never occurred to me to think of that, madam,&rdquo; said Kate, with an
ill-repressed scorn.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then it is for <i>me</i> to remind you of it,&rdquo; said her Ladyship,
sternly. &ldquo;You shall, first of all, write me an humble apology for this
vulgar tirade, this outrage upon my company, and then you shall leave the
house. Sit down there, and write as I shall dictate to you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kate seated herself with an air of implicit obedience at a writing-table,
and took up a pen.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Write,&rdquo; cried Lady Dorothea, sternly. &ldquo;Begin, &lsquo;My Lady.&rsquo; No. &lsquo;I approach
your Ladyship for the last time.&rsquo; No, not that. &lsquo;If the sincere sorrow in
which I pen these lines.&rsquo; No. Do it yourself. You best can express the
shame your heart should feel in such a moment. Let the words be your own!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kate leaned over the paper and wrote rapidly for a few seconds. Having
finished, she read over the lines, and seemed to reflect on them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Show me that paper!&rdquo; cried Lady Dorothea, impatiently. But, without
obeying the command, Kate said,&mdash;&ldquo;Your Ladyship will not be able to
leave Paris for at least forty hours. By that time the Monarchy will have
run its course in France. You will probably desire, however, to escape
from the scenes of turbulence sure to ensue. This will secure you a free
passage, whichever road you take.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What raving is all this?&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea, snatching the paper from
her hand, and then reading aloud in French,&mdash; &ldquo;&lsquo;The authorities are
required to aid and tender all assistance in their power to Lady Dorothea
Martin and all who accompany her, neither giving nor suffering any
opposition to be given to her or them in the prosecution of their
journey.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
(Signed) &ldquo;Jules Lagrange,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Minister of Police <i>ad interim</i>&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And this in your own hand, too!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Dorothea, contemptuously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, madam; but it will entitle it to the seal of the Prefecture, and
entitle <i>you</i> to all that it professes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So that I have the honor to shelter within my walls a chief of this
insurrection,&mdash;if it be worthy of such a name; one in the confidence
of this stupid <i>canaille</i>, who fancy that the fall of a Monarchy is
like a row in a <i>guinguette!</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your Ladyship is no longer in a position to question me or arraign my
actions. Before two days are over, the pageant of a king will have passed
off the stage, and men of a different stamp take the direction of affairs.
One of these will be he whose name I have affixed to that paper,&mdash;not
without due warranty to do so. Your Ladyship may or may not choose to
avail yourself of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I spurn the imposition,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea, tearing it in fragments. &ldquo;So
poor a cheat could not deceive <i>me</i>. As for yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, do not bestow a thought upon <i>me</i>, my Lady. I can suffice for my
own guidance. I only wait for morning to leave this house.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And it is to a city in such a state as this you would confide yourself.
Truly, mademoiselle, Republicanism has a right to be proud of you. You are
no half-convert to its principles.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Am I again to say, my Lady, that your control over me has ceased?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It has not. It shall not cease till I have restored you to the humble
roof from which I took you,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea, passionately. &ldquo;Your
father is our creature; he has no other subsistence than what we
condescend to bestow on him. He shall know, when you re-enter his doors,
why and for what cause you are there. Till that time come, you are, as you
have been, in my service.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, my Lady, the tie between us is snapped. Dependence is but a sad part
at the best; but so long as it is coupled with a certain show of respect
it is bearable. Destroy <i>that</i>, and it is mere slavery, abject and
degrading. I cannot go back to your Ladyship&rsquo;s service.&rdquo; And she gave to
the last word an emphasis of intense scorn.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You must and you shall,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea. &ldquo;If <i>you</i> are forgetful
of what it is your duty to remember, I am not. Here you shall remain;
without,&rdquo; added she, in an accent of supreme contempt, &ldquo;your counsel and
direction shall be sought after by the high and mighty individuals who are
so soon to administer the affairs of this nation.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The loud roll of a drum, followed by the louder clank of sabres and
musketry, here startled the speakers; and Kate, hastening to the window,
opened it, and stepped out upon the balcony. Day was just dawning; a gray
half-light covered the sky, but the dark shadows of the tall houses still
stretched over the Place. Here, now, the troops were all in motion; a
sudden summons having roused them to form in rank. The hasty character of
the movement showed that some emergency was imminent,&mdash;a fact
confirmed by the frequent arrival and departure of orderlies at full
speed.
</p>
<p>
After a brief interval of preparation the infantry formed in column, and,
followed by the artillery and cavalry, moved out of the Place at a quick
step. The measured tramp of the foot-soldiers, the clattering noise of the
train and the dragoons could be heard long after they had passed out of
sight; and Kate stood listening eagerly as to what would come next, when
suddenly a man in plain clothes rode hastily from one of the side-streets
into the centre of the Place. He looked around him for a moment or two,
and then disappeared. Within a few seconds after, a dull, indistinct sound
seemed to rise from the ground, which swelled gradually louder and louder,
and at last grew into the regular footfall of a great multitude moving in
measured time; and now a vast crowd poured into the Place, silent and
wordless. On they came from the various quarters that opened into the
square,&mdash;men, for the most part clad in blouses or in the coarse garb
of laborers. They were armed either with musket or sword, and in many
instances wore the cross-belt of the soldier. They proceeded at once to
barricade the square at its opening into the Rue de la Paix,&mdash;a work
which they accomplished with astonishing speed and regularity; for, while
Kate still looked, a formidable rampart was thrown up across the entire
street, along which a line of armed men was stationed, every one of whom,
by his attitude and gesture, betrayed the old discipline of a soldier&rsquo;s
life. Orders were given and obeyed, movements made, and dispositions
effected, with all the regularity and precision of regular troops; and by
the ready obedience of all, and the steady attitude observed, it was easy
to see that these men were trained to arms and to habits of discipline.
Not less evident was it that they who commanded them were not new to such
duties. But, more important than all such signs was the fact that here and
there through the mass might be seen the uniform of a soldier, or the
epaulette of an officer, showing that desertion to the ranks of the people
had already begun.
</p>
<p>
Kate was so occupied in attentive observation of the scene that she had
not noticed the arrival of another person in the apartment, and whose
voice now suddenly attracted her. It was Martin himself, hastily aroused
from his bed by his servant, who in great alarm told him that the capital
was in open revolt, the king&rsquo;s troops beaten back, and the people
victorious everywhere. &ldquo;There &lsquo;s not a moment to lose,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;we must
escape while we can. The road to Versailles is yet in possession of the
troops, and we can take that way.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lady Dorothea, partly overcome by the late scene, partly stunned by the
repeated shocks she experienced, made no reply whatever; and Martin,
judging from the expression of her features the anxiety she was suffering,
hastily added, &ldquo;Let me see Kate Henderson,&mdash;where is she?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lady Dorothea merely pointed towards the balcony, but did not utter a
word.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, have I found you?&rdquo; said Martin, stepping out upon the balcony. &ldquo;You
see what is doing,&mdash;I might say what is done,&rdquo; added he; &ldquo;for I
believe the game is well-nigh decided. Nothing but an overwhelming force
will now crush this populace. We must get away, and at once. Will you give
the orders? Send for post-horses; tell them to pack up whatever they can,&mdash;direct
everything, in fact. My Lady is too ill,&mdash;too much overcome to act,
or think of anything. Our whole reliance is upon you.&rdquo; While he was yet
uttering these broken, disjointed sentences, he had drawn Kate by the arm
within the room, and now stood beside Lady Dorothea&rsquo;s chair. Her Ladyship
raised her head and fixed her eyes upon Kate, who sustained the gaze
calmly and steadily, nor by the slightest movement displayed one touch of
any emotion. The glance, at first haughty and defiant, seemed at length to
grow weaker under the unmoved stare of the young girl, and finally she
bent down her head and sat as though overcome.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, Dora,&rdquo; said Martin, kindly, &ldquo;rouse yourself; you are always equal
to an effort when necessity presses. Tell Kate here what you wish, and she
‘ll do it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I want no aid,&mdash;no assistance, sir. Miss Henderson is her own
mistress,&mdash;she may do what, or go where she pleases.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Martin made a sign to Kate not to mind what he believed to be the mere
wandering of an over-excited brain; and then bending down over the chair,
said, &ldquo;Dear Dora, we must be active and stirring; the people will soon be
masters of the capital,&mdash;for a while, at least,&mdash;and there is no
saying what excesses they will commit.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do not offend Miss Henderson, sir,&rdquo; interposed Lady Dorothea; &ldquo;she has
equal confidence in their valor and their virtue.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What does this mean?&mdash;when did she fall into this state?&rdquo; asked he,
eagerly. And although only spoken in a whisper, Lady Dorothea overheard
them, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Let <i>her</i> tell you. She can give you the very
fullest explanation.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But, Dora, this is no time for trifling; we are here, in the midst of an
enraged populace and a maddened soldiery. There, listen!&mdash;that was
artillery; and now, hear!&mdash;the bells of the churches are sounding the
alarm.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They are ringing the knell of the Monarchy!&rdquo; said Kate, solemnly.
</p>
<p>
A hoarse, wild shout&mdash;aery like that of enraged wild beasts&mdash;arose
from the Place beneath, and all rushed to the window to see what had
occurred. It was a charge of heavy cavalry endeavoring to force the
barricade; and now, vigorously repulsed by the defenders, men and horses
were rolling on the ground in terrible confusion, while on the barricade
itself a hand-to-hand conflict was raging.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sharp work, by George!&rdquo; said a voice behind Kate&rsquo;s shoulder. She turned
and saw Captain Martin, who had just joined them unobserved.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I thought you many a mile away,&rdquo; said Kate, in a whisper.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So I should have been,&rdquo; replied he, in the same tone, &ldquo;but I was n&rsquo;t
going to lose this. I knew it was to come off to-day, and I thought it
would have been a thousand pities to be absent.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And are your wishes, then, with these gallant fellows?&rdquo; said she,
eagerly. &ldquo;Do I hear you aright, that it was to aid them you remained?
There! see how they bear down on the soldiery; they will not be
restrained; they are crossing the barricade, and charging with the
bayonet. It is only for liberty that men can fight thus. Oh that I were a
man, to be amongst them!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A stray shot from beneath here struck the architrave above their heads,
and sent down a mass of plaster over them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, Dora, this is needless peril,&rdquo; said Martin, drawing her within the
room. &ldquo;If you will not leave this, at least do not expose yourself
unnecessarily.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But it is exactly to get away&mdash;to escape while there is time&mdash;that
I came for,&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;They tell me that the mob are getting the
best of it, and, worse again, that the troops are joining them; so, to
make sure, I &lsquo;ve sent off Fenton to the post for horses, and I &lsquo;m
expecting him every moment. But here he is. Well, have you got the
horses?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, sir: the horses have all been taken by the people to mount orderlies;
the postmaster, too, has fled, and everything is in confusion. But if we
had horses the streets are impassable; from here to the Boulevard there
are no less than five barricades.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then what is to be done?&rdquo; cried Martin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They say, sir,&rdquo; replied Fenton, &ldquo;that by gaining the outer Boulevard on
foot, carriages and horses are easily found there, to reach Belleville,
St. Germain, or Versailles.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He is right,&rdquo; said the Captain; &ldquo;there is nothing else to be done. What
do <i>you</i> think?&rdquo; said he, addressing Kate, who stood intently
watching the movements in the Place beneath.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; do you agree with this plan?&rdquo; asked Martin, approaching her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried she, eagerly, and not heeding the question; &ldquo;the troops are
rapidly joining the people,&mdash;they come in numbers now,&mdash;and
yonder is an officer in his uniform.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Shame on him!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Dorothea, indignantly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So say I too,&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;He who wears a livery should not assume the
port and bearing of a free man. This struggle is for liberty, and should
only be maintained by the free!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How are we to pass these barricades?&rdquo; cried Martin, anxiously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will be your guide, sir, if that be all,&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;You may trust me.
I promise no more than I can perform.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She speaks truly,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea. &ldquo;Alas that we should see the day
when we cannot reject the aid!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is a matter I want to speak to you about,&rdquo; said Martin, drawing his
father aside, and speaking in a low, confidential tone. &ldquo;Massingbred&mdash;Jack
Massingbred&mdash;is now here, in my room. I know all about my mother&rsquo;s
dislike to him, and <i>he</i> knows it; indeed, he has as much as owned to
me that he deserved it all. But what is to be done? We cannot leave him
here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How came he to be here?&rdquo; asked Martin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He accompanied me from the Club, where, in an altercation of some sort,
he had just involved himself in a serious quarrel. He came here to be
ready to start this morning for Versailles, where the meeting was to take
place; but indeed he had no thought of accepting shelter under our roof;
and when he found where he was, it was with the greatest difficulty I
could persuade him to enter. None of us anticipated such a serious turn of
affairs as this; and now, of course, a meeting will be scarcely possible.
What are we to do with him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ask him frankly to join us if we obtain the horses.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But my mother?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;ll speak to her,&mdash;but it were better you did it, Harry. These are
not times to weigh scruples and balance difficulties. I don&rsquo;t myself think
that Massingbred treated us fairly, but it is not now I &lsquo;d like to
remember it. There, go; tell her what you have told me, and all will be
well.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The Captain drew nigh Lady Dorothea, and, leaning over her chair,
whispered to her for some minutes. At first, a slight gesture of
impatience burst from her, but afterwards she seemed to hear him calmly
and tranquilly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It would seem as though the humiliations of this night are never to have
an end,&rdquo; said she, with a sigh. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll bear my share of them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;that it was by no choice of <i>his</i> he
came here. His foot was on the threshold before he suspected it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Miss Henderson sent me, my Lady,&rdquo; said a servant, entering hastily, &ldquo;to
say that there is not a minute to be lost. They are expecting an attack on
the barricade in the Rue de la Paix, and we ought to pass through at
once.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;By whose orders?&rdquo; began she, haughtily; then, checking herself suddenly,
and in a voice weak and broken, added: &ldquo;I am ready. Give me your arm,
Harry, and do not leave me. Where is Mr. Martin?&rdquo; asked she.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He is waiting for your Ladyship at the foot of the stairs with another
gentleman,&rdquo; said the servant.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That must be Massingbred, for I told them to call him,&rdquo; said the Captain.
</p>
<p>
When Lady Dorothea, supported by the arm of her son, had reached the gate,
she found Martin and Massingbred standing to receive them, surrounded by a
numerous escort of servants, each loaded with some portion of the family
baggage.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A hasty summons, sir,&rdquo; said she, addressing Massingbred, and thus
abruptly avoiding the awkwardness of a more ceremonious meeting. &ldquo;A few
hours back none of us anticipated anything like this. Will it end
seriously, think you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is every prospect of such, madam,&rdquo; said he, bowing respectfully to
her salutation. &ldquo;Every moment brings fresh tidings of defection among the
troops, while the Marshal is paralyzed by contradictory orders.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is it always to be the fate of monarchy to be badly served in times of
peril?&rdquo; said she, bitterly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is very difficult to awaken loyalty against one&rsquo;s convictions of
right, madam. I mean,&rdquo; added he, as a gesture of impatience broke from
her, &ldquo;that these acts of the king, having no support from his real
friends, are weak stimulants to evoke deeds of daring and courage.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They are unworthy supporters of a Crown who only defend what they approve
of. This is but Democracy at best, and smacks of the policy which has
little to lose and everything to gain by times of trouble.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet, madam, such cannot be the case here; at least, it is assuredly
not so in the instance of him who is now speaking with Miss Henderson.&rdquo;
 And he pointed to a man who, holding the bridle of his horse on his arm,
walked slowly at Kate&rsquo;s side in the street before the door.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And who is he?&rdquo; asked she, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The greatest banker in Paris, madam,&mdash;one of the richest capitalists
of Europe,&mdash;ready to resign all his fortune in the struggle against a
rule which he foresees intended to bring back the days of a worn-out,
effete monarchy, rather than a system which shall invigorate the nation,
and enrich it by the arts of commerce and trade.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But his name&mdash;who is he?&rdquo; asked she, more impatiently.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Charles Lagrange, madam.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have heard the name before. I have seen it somewhere lately,&rdquo; said she,
trying to remember where and how.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You could scarcely have paid your respects at Neuilly, madam, without
seeing him. He was, besides, the favored guest at Madame de Mirecourt&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You would not imply, sir, that the Duchess condescended to any sympathy
with this party?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;More than half the Court, madam, are against the Crown; I will not say,
however, that they are, on that account, for the people.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There! she is making a sign to us to follow her,&rdquo; said Martin, pointing
towards Kate, who, still conversing with her companion, motioned to the
others to come up.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is from that quarter we receive our orders,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea,
sneeringly, as she prepared to follow.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What has she to do with it?&rdquo; exclaimed the Captain. &ldquo;To look at her, one
would say she was deep in the whole business.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A second gesture, more urgent than before, now summoned the party to make
haste.
</p>
<p>
Through the Place, crowded as it was by an armed and excited multitude,
way was rapidly made for the little party who now issued from the door of
the hotel. Kate Henderson walked in front, with Massingbred at her side
talking eagerly, and by his gestures seeming as though endeavoring to
extenuate or explain away something in his conduct; next came Lady
Dorothea, supported between her husband and her son, and while walking
slowly and with faltering steps, still carrying her head proudly erect,
and gazing on the stern faces around her with looks of haughty contempt.
After them were a numerous retinue of servants, with such effects as they
had got hurriedly together,&mdash;a terror-struck set, scarcely able to
crawl along from fear.
</p>
<p>
As they drew nigh the barricade, some men proceeded to remove a heavy
wagon which adjoined a house, and by the speed and activity of their
movements, urged on as they were by the orders of one in command, it might
be seen that the operation demanded promptitude.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We are scarcely safe in this,&rdquo; cried the officer. &ldquo;See! they are making
signs to us from the windows,&mdash;the troops are coming. If you pass out
now, you will be between two fires.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is yet time,&rdquo; said Kate, eagerly. &ldquo;Our presence in the street, too,
will delay them, and give you some minutes to prepare. And as for
ourselves, we shall gain one of the side-streets easily enough.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tie your handkerchief to your cane, sir,&rdquo; said the officer to
Massingbred.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My flag is ready,&rdquo; said Jack, gayly; &ldquo;I only hope they may respect it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now&mdash;now!&rdquo; cried Kate, with eagerness, and beckoning to Lady
Dorothea to hasten, &ldquo;the passage is free, and not a second to be lost!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you not coming with us?&rdquo; whispered Martin to her, as they passed out.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ll follow. But,&rdquo; added she, in a lower tone, &ldquo;were the choice
given me, it is here I &lsquo;d take my stand.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She looked full at Massingbred as she spoke, and, bending down his head,
he said, &ldquo;Had it been your place, it were mine also!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Quick,&mdash;quick, my Lady,&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;They must close up the passage
at once. They are expecting an attack.&rdquo; And so saying, she motioned
rapidly to Martin to move on.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The woman is a fiend,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea; &ldquo;see how her eyes sparkle, and
mark the wild exultation of her features.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Adieu, sir,&mdash;adieu!&rdquo; said Kate, waving her hand to one who seemed
the chief of the party. &ldquo;All my wishes are with you. Were I a man, my hand
should guarantee my heart.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come&mdash;come back!&rdquo; cried the officer. &ldquo;You are too late. There comes
the head of the column.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, never&mdash;never!&rdquo; exclamed Lady Dorothea, haughtily; &ldquo;protection
from such as these is worse than any death.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Give me the flag, then,&rdquo; cried Kate, snatching it from Massingbred&rsquo;s
hand, and hastening on before the others. And now the heavy wagon had
fallen back to its place, and a serried file of muskets peeped over it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Massingbred?&rdquo; asked the Captain, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yonder,&mdash;where he ought to be!&rdquo; exclaimed Kate, proudly, pointing to
the barricade, upon which, now, Jack was standing conspicuously, a musket
on his arm.
</p>
<p>
The troops in front were not the head of a column, but the advanced guard
of a force evidently at some distance off, and instead of advancing on the
barricade, they drew up and halted in triple file across the street. Their
attitude of silent, stern defiance&mdash;for it was such&mdash;evoked a
wild burst of popular fury, and epithets of abuse and insult were heaped
upon them from windows and parapets.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They are the famous Twenty-Second of the Line,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;who
forced the Pont-Neuf yesterday and drove the mob before them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is fortunate for us that we fall into such hands,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea,
waving her handkerchief as she advanced. But Kate had already approached
the line, and now halted at a command from the officer. While she
endeavored to explain how and why they were there, the cries and menaces
of the populace grew louder and wilder. The officer, a very young
subaltern, seemed confused and flurried; his eyes turned constantly
towards the street from which they had advanced, and he seemed anxiously
expecting the arrival of the regiment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I cannot give you a convoy, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I. scarcely know if
I have the right to let you pass. We may be attacked at any moment; for
aught I can tell, <i>you</i> may be in the interests of the insurgents&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We are cut off, Lieutenant,&rdquo; cried a sergeant, running up at the moment.
&ldquo;They have thrown up a barrier behind us, and it is armed already.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lay down your arms, then,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;and do not sacrifice your brave
fellows in a hopeless straggle.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Listen not to her, young man, but give heed to your honor and your
loyalty,&rdquo; cried Lady Dorothea. &ldquo;Is it against such an enemy as this French
soldiers fear to advance?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; cried the officer, waving his sword above his head. &ldquo;Let us
carry the barricade!&rdquo; And a wild yell of defiance from the windows
repeated the speech in derision.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are going to certain death!&rdquo; cried Kate, throwing herself before him.
&ldquo;Let <i>me</i> make terms for you, and they shall not bring dishonor on
you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here comes the regiment!&rdquo; called out the sergeant. &ldquo;They have forced the
barricade.&rdquo; And the quick tramp of a column, as they came at a run, now
shook the street.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Remember your cause and your King, sir,&rdquo; cried Lady Dorothea to the
officer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bethink you of your country,&mdash;of France,&mdash;and of Liberty!&rdquo; said
Kate, as she grasped his arm.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stand back!&mdash;back to the houses!&rdquo; said he, waving his sword.
&ldquo;Voltigeurs, to the front!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The command was scarcely issued, when a hail of balls rattled through the
air. The defenders of the barricade had opened their fire, and with a
deadly precision, too, for several fell at the very first discharge.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Back to the houses!&rdquo; exclaimed Martin, dragging Lady Dorothea along, who,
in her eagerness, now forgot all personal danger, and only thought of the
contest before her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Get under cover of the troops,&mdash;to the rear!&rdquo; cried the Captain, as
he endeavored to bear her away.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Back&mdash;back&mdash;beneath the archway!&rdquo; cried Kate, as, throwing her
arms around Lady Dorothea, she lifted her fairly from the ground, and
carried her within the deep recess of a <i>porte cochère</i>. Scarcely,
however, had she deposited her in safety, than she fell tottering
backwards and sank to the ground.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good Heavens! she is struck,&rdquo; exclaimed Martin, bending over her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is nothing,&mdash;a spent shot, and no more,&rdquo; said Kate, as she showed
the bullet which had perforated her dress beneath the arm.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A good soldier, by Jove!&rdquo; said the Captain, gazing with real admiration
on the beautiful features before him; the faint smile she wore heightening
their loveliness, and contrasting happily with their pallor.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There they go! They are up the barricade already; they are over it,&mdash;through
it!&rdquo; cried the Captain. &ldquo;Gallantly done!&mdash;gloriously done! No, by
Jove! they are falling back; the fire is murderous. See how they bayonet
them. The troops must win. They move together; they are like a wall! In
vain, in vain; they cannot do it! They are beaten,&mdash;they are lost!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who are lost?&rdquo; said Kate, in a half-fainting voice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The soldiers. And there &lsquo;s Massingbred on the top of the barricade, in
the midst of it all. I see his hat They are driven back&mdash;beaten&mdash;beaten!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come in quickly,&rdquo; cried a voice from behind; and a small portion of the
door was opened to admit them. &ldquo;The soldiers are retiring, and will kill
all before them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let <i>me</i> aid you; it is <i>my</i> turn now,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea,
assisting Kate to rise. &ldquo;Good Heavens! her arm is broken,&mdash;it is
smashed in two.&rdquo; And she caught the fainting girl in her arms.
</p>
<p>
Gathering around, they bore her within the gate, and had but time to bar
and bolt it when the hurried tramp without, and the wild yell of popular
triumph, told that the soldiers were retreating, beaten and defeated.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And this to save me!&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea, as she stooped over her. And
the scalding tears dropped one by one on Kate&rsquo;s cheek.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tear this handkerchief, and bind it around my arm,&rdquo; said Kate, calmly;
&ldquo;the pain is not very great, and there will be no bleeding, the doctors
say, from a gun-shot wound.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be the surgeon,&rdquo; said the Captain, addressing himself to the task
with more of skill than might be expected. &ldquo;I &lsquo;ve seen many a fellow
struck down who did n&rsquo;t bear it as calmly,&rdquo; muttered he, as he bent over
her. &ldquo;Am I giving you any pain?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not in the least; and if I were in torture, that glorious cheer outside
would rally me. Hear!&mdash;listen!&mdash;the soldiers are in full
retreat; the people, the noble-hearted people, are the conquerors!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Be calm, and think of yourself,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea, mildly, to her;
&ldquo;such excitement may peril your very life.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And it is worth a thousand lives to taste of it,&rdquo; said she, while her
cheek flushed, and her dark eyes gleamed with added lustre.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The street is clear now,&rdquo; said one of the servants to Martin, &ldquo;and we
might reach the Boulevard with ease.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let us go, then,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea. &ldquo;Let us look to <i>her</i> and
think of nothing till she be cared for.&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER IX. SOME CONFESSIONS OF JACK MASSINGBRED
</h2>
<p>
Upon two several occasions have we committed to Jack Massingbred the task
of conducting this truthful history; for the third time do we now purpose
to make his correspondence the link between the past and what is to
follow. We are not quite sure that the course we thus adopt is free from
its share of inconvenience, but we take it to avoid the evils of
reiteration inseparable from following out the same events from merely
different points of view. There is also another advantage to be gained.
Jack is before our readers; we are not. Jack is an acquaintance; we cannot
aspire to that honor. Jack&rsquo;s opinions, right or wrong as they may be, are
part and parcel of a character already awaiting their verdict. What he
thought and felt, hoped, feared, or wished, are the materials by which he
is to be judged; and so we leave his cause in his own hands.
</p>
<p>
His letter is addressed to the same correspondent to whom he wrote before.
It is written, too, at different intervals, and in different moods of
mind. Like the letters of many men who practise concealment with the world
at large, it is remarkable for great frankness and sincerity. He throws
away his mask with such evident signs of enjoyment that we only wonder if
he can ever resume it; but crafty men like to relax into candor, as
royalty is said to indulge with pleasure in the chance moments of
pretended equality. It is, at all events, a novel sensation; and even that
much, in this routine life of ours, is something!
</p>
<p>
He writes from Spa, and after some replies to matters with which we have
no concern, proceeds thus:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of the Revolution, then, and the Three Glorious Days as they are called,
I can tell you next to nothing, and for this simple reason, that I was
there fighting, shouting, throwing up barricades, singing the
‘Marseillaise,&rsquo; smashing furniture, and shooting my &lsquo;Swiss,&rsquo; like the
rest. As to who beat the troops, forced the Tuileries, and drove Marmont
back, you must consult the newspapers. Personal adventures I could give
you to satiety, hairbreadth &lsquo;scapes and acts of heroism by the dozen; but
these narratives are never new, and always tiresome. The serious
reflectiveness sounds like humbug, and, if one treats them lightly, the
flippancy is an offence. Jocular heroism is ever an insult to the reader.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You say, &lsquo;<i>Que diable allait-il faire dans cette galère?</i>&rsquo; and I
answer, it was all <i>her</i> doing. Yes, Harry, <i>she</i> was there. I
was thinking of nothing less in the world than a great &lsquo;blow for freedom,&rsquo;
as the &lsquo;Globe&rsquo; has it. I had troubled my head wonderfully little about the
whole affair. Any little interest I took was in the notion that if our
‘natural enemies,&rsquo; the French, were to fall to and kill each other, there
would be so much the fewer left to fight against us; but as to who was to
get the upper hand, or what they were to do when they had it, I gave
myself no imaginable concern. I had a vague, shadowy kind of impression
that the government was a bad one, but I had a much stronger conviction
that the people deserved no better. My leanings&mdash;my instincts, if you
prefer it&mdash;were with the Crown. The mob and its sentiments are always
repulsive. Popular enthusiasm is a great ocean, but it is an ocean of
dirty water, and you cannot come out clean from the contact; and so I
should have wished well to royalty, but for an accident,&mdash;a mere
trifle in its way, but one quite sufficient, even on historic grounds, to
account for a man&rsquo;s change of opinions. The troops shot my cab-horse, sent
a bullet through poor &lsquo;Beverley,&rsquo; and seriously damaged a new hat which I
wore at the time, accompanying these acts with expressions the reverse of
compliment or civility. I was pitched out into the gutter, and, most
appropriately you will say, I got up a Radical, a Democrat, a Fourierist,&mdash;anything,
in short, that shouts &lsquo;Down with Kings, and up with the Sovereign People!&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My principles&mdash;don&rsquo;t smile at the word&mdash;led me into a stupid
altercation with a very pleasant acquaintance, and we parted to meet the
next morning in hostility,&mdash;at least, such was our understanding; but
by the time that our difference should have been settled, <i>I</i> was
carried away on a stretcher to the Hôtel Dieu, wounded, and he was flung,
a corpse, into the Seine. I intended to have been a most accurate narrator
of events, journalizing for you, hour by hour, with all the stirring
excitement of the present tense, but I cannot; the crash and the hubbub
are still in my brain, and the infernal chaos of the streets is yet over
me. Not to speak of my wound,&mdash;a very ugly sabre-cut in the neck,&mdash;severing
I don&rsquo;t know what amount of nerves, arteries, and such-like &lsquo;small deer,&rsquo;
every one of which, however, has its own peculiar perils in the shape of
aneurisms, tetanus, and so forth, in case I am not a miracle of patience,
calmness, and composure.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Martins are nursing and comforting and chicken-brothing me to my
heart&rsquo;s content, and La Henderson, herself an invalid, with a terrible
broken arm, comes and reads to me from time to time. What a girl it is!
Wounded in a street encounter, she actually carried Lady Dorothea into a
porte-cochère, and when they had lost their heads in terror, could neither
issue an order to the servants nor know what way to turn, she took the
guidance of the whole party, obtained horses and carriages and an escort,
escaped from Paris, and reached Versailles in the midst of flying
courtiers and dismayed ministers, and actually was the very first to bring
the tidings that the game of monarchy was up,&mdash;that the king had
nothing left for it but an inglorious flight. To the Duchesse de
Mire-court she made this communication, which it seems none of the
court-followers had the courage or honesty to do before. The Duchess, in
her terror, actually dragged her into the presence of the king, and made
her repeat what she had said. The scene, as told me, was quite dramatic;
the king took her hand to lead her to a seat, but it was unfortunately of
the wounded arm, and she fainted. The sight of the wounded limb so
affected the nerves of monarchy that he gave immediate orders to depart,
and was off within an hour.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How they found me out a patient in a ward of the Hôtel Dieu, rescued and
carried me away with them, I have heard full half a dozen times, but I &lsquo;m
far from being clear enough to repeat the story; and, indeed, when I try
to recall the period, the only images which rise up before me are long
ranges of white coverlids, pale faces, and groans and cries of suffering,
with the dark curly head of a great master of torture peeping at me, and
whom, I am told, is the Baron Dupuytren, the Surgeon-in-Chief. After these
comes a vision of litters and <i>charrettes</i>,&mdash;sore joltings and
stoppages to drink water&mdash;But I shall rave if I go on. Better I
should tell you of my pleasant little bedroom here, opening on a small
garden, with a tiny fountain trying to sprinkle the wild myrtle and
blush-roses around it, and sportively sending its little plash over me, as
the wind wafts it into my chamber. My luxurious chair and easy-cushioned
sofa, and my table littered with everything, from flowers to French
romances; not to speak of the small rustic seat beside the window, where
she has been sitting the last hour, and has only quitted to give me time
to write this to you. I know it&mdash;I see it&mdash;all you can say, all
that you are saying at this moment, is fifty times more forcibly echoing
within my own heart, and repeating in fitful sentences: &lsquo;A ruined man&mdash;a
broken fortune&mdash;a mad attachment&mdash;a life of struggle,
difficulty, and failure!&rsquo; But why should it be failure? Such a girl for a
wife ought in itself to be an earnest of success. Are not her qualities
exactly those that do battle with the difficulties of fortune? Self-denial&mdash;ambition&mdash;courage&mdash;an
intense, an intuitive knowledge of the world&mdash;and then, a
purpose-like devotion to whatever she undertakes, that throws an air of
heroism over all her actions.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Birth&mdash;blood&mdash;family connections&mdash;what have they done for
me, except it be to entail upon me the necessity of selecting a career
amidst the two or three that are supposed to suit the well-born? I may be
a Life Guardsman, or an unpaid attaché, but I must not be a physician or a
merchant. Nor is it alone that certain careers are closed against us, but
certain opinions too. I must not think ill of the governing class,&mdash;I
must never think well of the governed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, Harry, the colonies are the remedy for all this. There, at least, a
man can fashion existence as arbitrarily as he can the shape and size of
his house. None shall dictate his etiquette, no more than his
architecture; and I am well weary of the slavery of this old-world life,
with our worship of old notions and old china, both because they are
cracked, damaged, and useless. I &lsquo;ll marry her. I have made up my mind on
‘t. Spare me all your remonstrances, all your mock compassion. Nor is it
like a fellow who has not seen the world in its best gala suit, affecting
to despise rank, splendor, and high station. <i>I have</i> seen the thing.
I have cantered my thoroughbred along Rotten Row, eaten my truffled
dinners in Belgravia, whispered my nonsense over the white shoulders of
the fairest and best-born of England&rsquo;s daughters. I know to a decimal
fraction the value of all these; and, what &lsquo;s more, I know what one pays
for them,&mdash;the miserable vassalage, the poor slavery of mind, soul,
and body they cost!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is the terror of exclusion here, the dread of coldness there&mdash;the
possibility of offence to &lsquo;his Grace&rsquo; on this side, or misconception by
‘her Ladyship&rsquo; on that&mdash;sway and rule a man so that he may neither
eat, drink, nor sleep without a &lsquo;Court Guide&rsquo; in his pocket. I &lsquo;ve done
with it! now and forever,&mdash;I tell you frankly,&mdash;I return no more
to this bondage.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have written a farewell address to my worthy constituents of
Oughterard. I have told them that, &lsquo;feeling an instinct of independence
within me, I can no longer remain their representative; that, as a man of
honor, I shrink from the jobbery of the little borough politicians, and,
as a gentleman, I beg to decline their intimacy.&rsquo; They took me for want of
a better&mdash;I leave them for the same reason.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To my father I have said: &lsquo;Let us make a compromise. As your son I have a
claim on the House. Now, what will you give for my share? I &lsquo;ll neither
importune you for place, nor embarrass you with solicitations for
employment. Help me to stock my knapsack, and I &lsquo;ll find my road myself.&rsquo;
<i>She</i> knows nothing of these steps on my part; nor shall she, till
they have become irrevocable. She is too proud ever to consent to what
would cost me thus heavily; but the expense once incurred,&mdash;the
outlay made,&mdash;she cannot object to what has become the law of my
future life.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I send off these two documents to-night; this done, I shall write to her
an offer of marriage. What a fever I &lsquo;m in! and all because I feel the
necessity of defending myself to <i>you</i>,&mdash;to you of all men the
most headstrong, reckless, and self-indulgent,&mdash;a fellow who never
curbed a caprice nor restrained a passing fancy; and yet you are just the
man to light your cigar, and while you puff away your blue cloud, mutter
on about rashness, folly, insanity, and the rest of it, as if the state of
your bank account should make that wisdom in <i>you</i>, which with <i>me</i>
is but mere madness! But I tell you, Harry, it is your very thousands per
annum that preclude you from doing what I can. It is your house in town,
your stud at Tattersall&rsquo;s, your yacht at Cowes, your grouse-lodge in the
Highlands, that tie and fetter you to live like some scores of others,
with whom you have n&rsquo;t one solitary sympathy, save in income! You are
bound up in all the recognizances of your wealth to dine stupidly, sup
languidly, and sink down at last into a marriage of convenience,&mdash;to
make a wife of her whom &lsquo;her Grace&rsquo; has chosen for you without a single
speculation in the contract save the thought of the earl you will be
allied to, and the four noble families you &lsquo;ll have the right to go in
mourning for.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what worse than cant it is to talk of what they call an indiscreet
match! What does&mdash;what can the world know as to the reasons that
impel you, or me, or anybody else, to form a certain attachment? Are they
acquainted with our secret and most hidden emotions? Do they understand
the project of life we have planned to ourselves? Have they read our utter
weariness and contempt for forms that <i>they</i> venerate, and social
distinctions that <i>they</i> worship? I am aware that in some cases it
requires courage to do this; and in doing it a man virtually throws down
the glove to the whole world, and says, &lsquo;This woman&rsquo;s love is to me more
than all of you&rsquo;&mdash;and so say I at this moment. I must cry halt, I
see, Harry. I have set these nerves at work in my wound, and the pain is
agony. Tomorrow&mdash;to-night, if I &lsquo;m able&mdash;I shall continue.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Midnight.&rdquo; They have just wished me good-night, after having spent the
evening here reading out the newspapers for me, commenting upon them, and
exerting themselves to amuse me in a hundred good-natured ways. You would
like this same stately old Lady Dorothea. She is really &lsquo;Grande Dame&rsquo; in
every respect,&mdash;dress, air, carriage, gesture, even her slow and
measured speech is imposing, and her prejudices, uttered as they are in
such perfect sincerity of heart, have something touching about them, and
her sorrowful pity for the mob sounded more gracefully than Kate&rsquo;s
enthusiastic estimate of their high deservings. It does go terribly
against the grain to fancy an alliance between coarse natures and noble
sentiments, and to believe in the native nobility of those who never touch
soap! I have had a kind of skirmish with La Henderson upon this theme
to-night. She was cross and out of temper, and bore my bantering badly.
The fact is, she is utterly disgusted at the turn things have taken in
France; and not altogether without reason, since, after all their bluster
and bloodshed and barricades, they have gone back to a monarchy again.
They barred out the master to make &lsquo;the head usher&rsquo; top of the school. Let
us see if he won&rsquo;t be as fond of the birch as his predecessor. Like all
mutineers, they found they could n&rsquo;t steer the ship when they had murdered
the captain! How hopeless it makes one of humanity to see such a spectacle
as this, Harry, and how low is one&rsquo;s estimate of the species after such
experience! You meet some half-dozen semi-bald, spectacled old gentlemen
in society, somewhat more reserved than the rest of the company, fond of
talking to each other, and rather distrustful of strangers; you find them
slow conversers at dinner, sorry whist-players in the drawing-room; you
are told, however, that one is a President of the Council, another the
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and a third something equally important.
You venerate them accordingly, while you mutter the old Swede&rsquo;s apothegm
about the &lsquo;small intelligences&rsquo; that rule mankind. Wait awhile! There is a
row in the streets: a pickpocket has appealed to the public to rescue him
from the ignoble hands of the police; an escaped felon has fired at the
judge who sentenced him, in the name of Liberty and Fraternity. No matter
what the cause, there <i>is</i> a row. The troops are called out; some are
beaten, some join the insurgents. The government grows frightened&mdash;temporizes&mdash;offers
terms&mdash;and sends for more soldiers. The people&mdash;I never clearly
knew what the word meant&mdash;the people make extravagant demands, and
will not even give time to have them granted,&mdash;in a word, the whole
state is subverted, the king, if there be one, in flight, the royal family
missing, the ministers nowhere! No great loss you &lsquo;ll say, if the four or
five smooth-faced imbecilities we have spoken of are not to the fore! But
there is your error, Harry,&mdash;your great error. These men, used to
conduct and carry on the government, cannot be replaced. The new
capacities do nothing but blunder, and maybe issue contradictory orders
and impede each other&rsquo;s actions. To improvise a Secretary of State is
about as wise a proceeding as to take at hazard a third-class passenger
and set him to guide the engine of a train. The only difference is that
the machinery of state is ten thousand times more complex than that of a
steam-engine, and the powers for mischief and misfortune in due
proportion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But why talk of these things? I have had enough and too much of them
already this evening; women, too, are unpleasant disputants in politics.
They attach their faith to persons, not parties. Miss Henderson is,
besides, a little spoiled by the notice of those maxim-mongers who write
leaders in the &lsquo;Débats, and articles for the &lsquo;Deux Mondes.&rsquo; They have, or
affect to have, a kind of pitying estimate for our English constitutional
forms, which is rather offensive. At least, she provoked me, and I am
relapsing into bad temper, just by thinking of it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You tell me that you once served with Captain Martin, and I see you
understand him; not that it requires much study to do so. You say he was
reckoned a good officer; what a sneer is that on the art military!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There are, however, many suitable qualities about him, and he certainly
possesses the true and distinctive element of a gentleman,&mdash;he knows
how to be idle. Ay, Harry, that is a privilege that your retired banker or
enriched cotton-spinner never attains to. They must be up and doing,&mdash;where
there is nothing to do. They carry the spirit of the counting-house and
the loom into society with them, and having found a pleasure in business,
they want to make a business of pleasure. Now, Martin understands idling
to perfection. His tea and toast, his mutton cutlet, and his mustachios
are abundant occupation for him. With luncheon about two o&rsquo;clock, he
saunters through the stables, sucking a lighted cigar, filing his nails,
and admiring his boots, till it &lsquo;s time to ride out. He comes to me about
nine of an evening, and we play piquet till I get sleepy; after which he
goes to &lsquo;the rooms,&rsquo; and, I believe, plays high; at least, I suspect so;
for he has, at times, the forced calm&mdash;that semi-jocular resignation&mdash;one
sees in a heavy loser. He has been occasionally, too, probing me about
Merl,&mdash;you remember the fellow who had the rooms near Knightsbridge,&mdash;so
that I opine he has been dabbling in loans. What a sorry spectacle such a
creature as this in the toils of the Israelite, for he is the &lsquo;softest of
the soft.&rsquo; I see it from the effect La Henderson has produced upon him. He
is in love with her,&mdash;actually in love. He even wanted to make me his
confidant&mdash;and I narrowly escaped the confession&mdash;only yesterday
evening. Of course, he has no suspicion of my attachment in the same
quarter, so that it would be downright treachery in me to listen to his
avowal. Another feeling, too, sways me, Harry,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I could
hear a man profess admiration for the woman that I mean to marry, without
the self-same sense of resentment I should experience were I already her
husband. I &lsquo;m certain I &lsquo;d shoot him for it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;La belle Kate and I parted coldly&mdash;dryly, I should call it&mdash;this
evening. I had fancied she was above coquetry, but she is not. Is any
woman? She certainly gave the Captain what the world would call
encouragement all the night; listened attentively to tiresome
tiger-huntings and stories of the new country; questioned him about his
Mahratta campaigns, and even hinted at how much she would like an Indian
life. Perhaps the torment she was inflicting on Lady Dorothea amused her;
perhaps it was the irritation she witnessed in me gave the zest to this
pastime. It is seldom that she condescends to be either amused or amusing;
and I own it is a part does not suit her. She is a thousand times more
attractive sitting over her embroidery-frame, raising her head at times to
say a few words,&mdash;ever apposite and well chosen,&mdash;always simple,
too, and to the purpose; or even by a slight gesture bearing agreement
with what is said around her; till, with a sudden impulse, she pours forth
fast, rapidly, and fluently some glowing sentiment of praise or censure,
some glorious eulogy of the good, or some withering depreciation of the
wrong. Then it is that you see how dark those eyes can be, how deep-toned
that voice, and with what delicacy of expression she can mould and fashion
every mood of mind, and give utterance to sentiments that till then none
have ever known how to embody.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is such a descent to her to play coquette! Cleopatra cannot&mdash;should
not be an Abigail. I am low and depressed to-night; I scarcely know why:
indeed, I have less reason than usual for heavy-heartedness. These people
are singularly kind and attentive to me, and seem to have totally
forgotten how ungratefully once before I repaid their civilities. What a
stupid mistake do we commit in not separating our public life from our
social one, so as to show that our opinions upon measures of state are
disconnected with all the sentiments we maintain for our private
friendships. I detect a hundred sympathies, inconceivable points of
contact, between these people and myself. We pass hours praising the same
things, and abusing the same people; and how could it possibly sever our
relations that I would endow Maynooth when they would pull it down, or
that I liked forty-shilling freeholders better than ten-pound
householders? You &lsquo;ll say that a certain earnestness accompanies strong
convictions, and that when a man is deeply impressed with some supposed
truths, he &lsquo;ll not measure his reprobation of those who assail them. But a
lawyer does all this, and forfeits nothing of the esteem of &lsquo;his learned
brother on the opposite side.&rsquo; Nay, they exchange very-ugly knocks at
times, and inflict very unseemly marks even with the gloves on; still they
go homeward, arm-in-arm, after, and laugh heartily at both plaintiff and
defendant. By Jove! Harry, it may sound ill, but somehow it seems as
though to secure even a moderate share of enjoyment in this life one must
throne Expediency in the seat of Principle. I &lsquo;ll add the conclusion
to-morrow, and now say good-night.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Three days have passed over since I wrote the last time to you, and it
would require as many weeks were I to chronicle all that has passed
through my mind in the interval. Events there have been few; but
sensations&mdash;emotions, enough for a lifetime. Nor dare I recall them!
Faintly endeavoring to trace a few broken memories, my pains of mind and
body come back again, so that you must bear with me if I be incoherent,
almost unintelligible.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The day after I wrote to you, I never saw her. My Lady, who came as usual
to visit me in the day, said something about Miss Henderson having a
headache. Unpleasant letters from her family&mdash;obliged to give up the
day to answering them; but all so confused and with such evident
constraint as to show me that something disagreeable loomed in view.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Captain dropped in about four o&rsquo;clock, and as the weather was
unfavorable, we sat down to our party of piquet. By a little address, I
continued to lose nearly every game, and so gradually led him into a
conversation while we played; but I soon saw that he only knew something
had occurred &lsquo;upstairs,&rsquo; but knew not what.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo; I suspect, however,&rsquo; added he, &lsquo;it is only the old question as to
Kate&rsquo;s going away.&rsquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;Going away! Going where?&rsquo; cried I.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Home to her father; she is resolutely bent upon it,&mdash;has been so
ever since we left Paris. My mother, who evidently&mdash;but on what score
I know not&mdash;had some serious difference with her, is now most eager
to make concessions, and would stoop to&mdash;what for her is no trifle&mdash;even
solicitation to induce her to stay, has utterly failed; so, too, has my
father. Persuasion and entreaty not succeeding, I suspect&mdash;but it is
only suspicion&mdash;that they have had recourse to parental authority,
and asked old Henderson to interfere. At least, a letter has come this
morning from the West of Ireland, for Kate, which I surmise to be in his
hand. She gave it, immediately on reading it, to my mother, and I could
detect in her Ladyship&rsquo;s face, while she perused it, unmistakable signs of
satisfaction. When she handed it back, too, she gave a certain
condescending smile, which, in my mother, implies victory, and seems to
say, &ldquo;Let us be friends now,&mdash;I &lsquo;m going to signal&mdash;cease
firing.&rdquo;&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;And Kate, did she make any remark&mdash;say anything?&rsquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;Not a syllable.
She folded up the document, carefully and steadily, and placed it in her
work-box, and then resumed her embroidery in silence. I watched her
narrowly, while I affected to read the paper, and saw that she had to rip
out half she had done. After a while my mother said,&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;You &lsquo;ll not
answer that letter to-day, probably?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;"I mean to do so, my Lady,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;and, with your permission, will
beg you to read my reply.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;"Very well,&rdquo; said my mother, and left the room. I was standing outside
on the balcony at the time, so that Kate believed, after my mother&rsquo;s
departure, she was quite alone. It was then she opened the letter, and
re-read it carefully. I never took my eyes off her; and yet what was
passing in her mind, whether joy, grief, disappointment, or pleasure, I
defy any man to declare; nor when, having laid it down once more, she took
up her work, not a line or a lineament betrayed her. It was plain enough
the letter was no pleasant one, and I expected to have heard her sigh
perhaps, or at least show some sign of depression; but no, she went on
calmly, and at last began to sing, in a low, faint voice, barely audible
where I stood, one of her little barcarole songs she is so fond of; and if
there was no sorrow in her own heart, by Jove! she made mine throb heavily
as I listened! I stood it as long as I was able, and then coughed to show
that I was there, and entered the room. She never lifted her head, or
noticed me, not even when I drew a chair close to her, and sat down at her
side.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I suppose, Massingbred,&rsquo; said he, after a pause, &lsquo;you &lsquo;ll laugh at me,
if I tell you I was in love with the Governess! Well, I should have
laughed too, some six months ago, if any man had prophesied it; but the
way I put the matter to myself is this: If I do succeed to a good estate,
I have a right to indulge my own fancy in a wife; if I don&rsquo;t,&mdash;that
is, if I be a ruined man,&mdash;where &lsquo;s the harm in marrying beneath me?&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Quite right, admirably argued,&rsquo; said I, impatiently; &lsquo;go on.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I &lsquo;m glad you agree with me,&rsquo; said he, with the stupid satisfaction of
imbecility. &lsquo;I thought I had reduced the question to its very narrowest
bounds.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;So you have; go on,&rsquo; cried I.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;"Miss Henderson,&rdquo; said I,&mdash;for I determined to show that I was
speaking seriously, and so I did n&rsquo;t call her Kate,&mdash; &ldquo;Miss
Henderson, I want to speak to you. I have been long seeking this
opportunity; and if you will vouchsafe me a few minutes now, and hear me,
on a subject upon which all my happiness in life depends&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;When I got that far, she put her work down on her knee, and stared at me
with those large, full eyes of hers so steadily&mdash;ay, so haughtily,
too&mdash;that I half wished myself fifty miles away.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;"Captain Martin,&rdquo; said she, in a low, distinct voice, &ldquo;has it ever
occurred to you in life to have, by a mere moment of reflection, a sudden
flash of intelligence, saved yourself from some step, some act, which, if
accomplished, had brought nothing but outrage to your feeling, and insult
to your self-esteem? Let such now rescue you from resuming this theme.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;"But you# don&rsquo;t understand me,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;What I wish to say&mdash;&rdquo; Just
at that instant my father came into the room in search of her, and I made
my escape to hide the confusion that I felt ready to overwhelm me.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;And have you not seen her since?&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;No. Indeed, I think it quite as well, too. She &lsquo;ll have time to think
over what I said, and see what a deuced good offer it is; for though I
know she was going to make objections about inequality of station and all
that at the time, reflection will bring better thoughts.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;And she &lsquo;ll consent, you think?&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I wish I had a bet on it,&rsquo; said he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;So you shall, then,&rsquo; said I, endeavoring to seem thoroughly at my ease.
‘It&rsquo;s a very unworthy occasion for a wager, Martin; but I&rsquo;ll lay five
hundred to one she refuses you.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Taken, and booked,&rsquo; cried he, writing it down in his note-book. &ldquo;I only
regret it is not in thousands.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;So it should be, if I could honestly stake what I have n&rsquo;t got.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;You are so sanguine of winning? &lsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo; So certain, you ought to say.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo; Of course you use no influence against me,&mdash;you take no step of
any kind to affect her decision.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Certainly not.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Nor are you&mdash;But,&rsquo; added he, laughing, &lsquo;I need n&rsquo;t make that
proviso. I was going to say, you are not to ask her yourself.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I &lsquo;ll even promise you that, if you like,&rsquo; said I.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Then what can you mean?&rsquo; said he, with a puzzled look. &lsquo;But whatever it
be, I can stand the loss. I &lsquo;ve won very close to double as much from you
this evening.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;And as to the disappointment?&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, <i>you</i> &lsquo;ll not mention it, I &lsquo;m certain, neither will she, so
none will be the wiser; and, after all, the real bore in all these cases
is the gossip.&rsquo; And with this consolatory reflection he left me to dress
for dinner. How well bred a fellow seems who has no feeling, but just tact
enough to detect the tone of the world and follow it! That&rsquo;s Martin&rsquo;s
case, and his manners are perfect! After he was gone, I was miserable for
not having quarrelled with him,&mdash;said something outrageous, insolent,
and unbearable. That he should have dared to insult the young girl by such
presumption as the offer of <i>his</i> hand is really too much. What
difference of station&mdash;wide as the poles asunder&mdash;could compare
with their real inequality? The fop, the idler, the incompetent, to aspire
to <i>her!</i> Even his very narrative proclaimed his mean nature,
wandering on, as it did, from a lounge on the balcony to an offer of
marriage!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now, to conclude this wearisome story&mdash;and I fancy, Harry, that
already you half deem me a fitting rival for the tiresome Captain,&mdash;but
to finish, Martin came early into my room, and laying a bank-note for £100
on the bed, merely added, &lsquo;You were right; there&rsquo;s your money.&rsquo; I&rsquo;d have
given double the sum to hear the details of this affair,&mdash;in what
terms the refusal was conveyed,&mdash;on what grounds she based it; but he
would not afford me the slightest satisfaction on any of these points.
Indeed, he displayed more vigor of character than I suspected in him, in
the way he arrested my inquiries. He left this for Paris immediately
after, so that the mystery of that interview will doubtless remain
impenetrable to me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We are all at sixes and sevens to-day. Old Martin, shocked by some
tidings of Ireland that he chanced upon in the public papers, I believe,
has had a stroke of paralysis, or a seizure resembling that malady. Lady
Dorothea is quite helpless from terror, and but for Kate, the whole
household would be in utter chaos and disorganization; but she goes about,
with her arm in a sling, calm and tranquil, but with the energy and
activity of one who feels that all depends upon her guidance and
direction. The servants obey her with a promptitude that proclaims
instinct; and even the doctor lays aside the mysterious jargon of his
craft, and condescends to talk sense to her. I have not seen her; passing
rumors only reach me in my solitude, and I sit here writing and brooding
alternately.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;P. S. Martin is a little better; no immediate danger to life, but slight
hopes of ultimate recovery. I was wrong as to the cause. It was a
proclamation of outlawry against his son, the Captain, which he read in
the &lsquo;Times.&rsquo; Some implacable creditor or other had pushed his claim so
far, as I believe is easy enough to do nowadays; and poor Martin, who
connected this stigma with all the disgrace that once accompanied such a
sentence, fell senseless to the ground, and was taken up palsied. He is
perfectly collected and even tranquil now, and they wheeled me in to sit
with him for an hour or so. Lady Dorothea behaves admirably; the first
shock overwhelmed her, but that passed off, and she is now all that could
be imagined of tenderness and zeal.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Kate I saw but for a second. She asked me to write to Captain Martin, and
request him to hasten home. It was no time to trifle with her; so I simply
promised to do so, adding,&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>You,</i> I trust, will not leave
this at such a moment?&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Assuredly not,&rsquo; said she, slightly coloring at what implied my knowledge
of her plans.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Then all will go on well in that case,&rsquo; said I.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I never knew that I was reckoned what people call lucky,&rsquo; said she,
smiling. &lsquo;Indeed, most of those with whom I have been associated in life
might say the opposite.&rsquo; And then, without waiting to hear me, she left
the room.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My brain is throbbing and my cheeks burning; some feverish access is upon
me. So I send off this ere I grow worse.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your faithful friend,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Jack Massingbred.&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER X. HOW ROGUES AGREE!
</h2>
<p>
Leaving the Martins in their quiet retreat at Spa, nor dwelling any longer
on a life whose daily monotony was unbroken by an incident, we once more
turn our glance westward. Were we assured that our kind readers&rsquo;
sympathies were with us, the change would be a pleasure to us, since it is
there, in that wild mountain tract, that pathless region of fern and wild
furze, that we love to linger, rambling half listlessly through silent
glens and shady gorges, or sitting pensively on the storm-lashed shore,
till sea and sky melt into one, and naught lowers through the gloom save
the tall crags above us.
</p>
<p>
We are once more back again at the little watering-place of Kilkieran, to
which we introduced our readers in an early chapter of this narrative; but
another change has come over that humble locality. The Osprey&rsquo;s Nest, the
ornamented villa, on which her Ladyship had squandered so lavishly good
money and bad taste, was now an inn! A vulgar sign-board, representing a
small boat in a heavy sea, hung over the door, with the words &ldquo;The
Corragh&rdquo; written underneath. The spacious saloon, whose bay-windows opened
on the Atlantic, was now a coffee-room, and the small boudoir that
adjoined it&mdash;desecration of desecrations&mdash;the bar!
</p>
<p>
It needs not to have been the friend or favored guest beneath a roof where
elegance and refinement have prevailed to feel the shock at seeing them
replaced by all that ministers to coarse pleasure and vulgar association.
The merest stranger cannot but experience a sense of disgust at the
contrast. Whichever way you turned, some object met the eye recalling past
splendor and present degradation; indeed, Toby Shea, the landlord, seemed
to feel as one of his brightest prerogatives the right of insulting the
memory of his predecessors, and throwing into stronger antithesis the
&ldquo;former&rdquo; and the &ldquo;now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here ye are now, sir, in my Lady&rsquo;s own parlor; and that&rsquo;s her bedroom,
where I left your trunk,&rdquo; said he, as he ushered in a newly arrived
traveller, whose wet and road-stained drapery bore traces of an Irish
winter&rsquo;s day. &ldquo;Mr. Scanlan told me that your honor would be here at four
o&rsquo;clock, and he ordered dinner for two, at five, and a good dinner you &lsquo;ll
have.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There; let them open my traps, and fetch me a pair of slippers and a
dressing-gown,&rdquo; broke in the traveller; &ldquo;and be sure to have a good fire
in my bedroom. What an infernal climate! It has rained since the day I
landed at Dublin; and now that I have come down here, it has blown a
hurricane besides. And how cold this room is!&rdquo; added he, shuddering.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all by reason of them windows,&rdquo; said Toby,&mdash;&ldquo;French windows
they call them; but I&rsquo;ll get real Irish sashes put up next season, if I
live. It was a fancy of that ould woman that built the place to have
nothing that was n&rsquo;t foreign.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They are not popular, then,&mdash;the Martins?&rdquo; asked the stranger.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Popular!&rdquo; echoed Toby. &ldquo;Begorra, they are not. Why would they be? Is it
rack-renting, process sarving, extirminating, would make them popular?
Sure we&rsquo;re all ruined on the estate. There isn&rsquo;t a mother&rsquo;s son of us
might n&rsquo;t be in jail; and it&rsquo;s not Maurice&rsquo;s fault, either,&mdash;Mr.
Scanlan&rsquo;s, I mean. Your honor&rsquo;s a friend of his, I believe,&rdquo; added he,
stealthily. The stranger gave a short nod. &ldquo;Sure he only does what he&rsquo;s
ordered; and it&rsquo;s breaking his heart it is to do them cruel things they
force him to.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Was the management of the estate better when they lived at home?&rdquo; asked
the stranger.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Some say yes, more says no. I never was their tenant myself, for I lived
in Oughterard, and kept the &lsquo;Goose and Griddle&rsquo; in John Street; but I
believe, if the truth was told, it was always pretty much the same. They
were azy and moderate when they did n&rsquo;t want money, but ready to take your
skin off your back when they were hard up.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And is that their present condition?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I think it is,&rdquo; said he, with a confident grin. &ldquo;They &lsquo;re spending
thousands for hundreds since they went abroad; and that chap in the
dragoons&mdash;the Captain they call him&mdash;sells a farm, or a plot of
ground, just the way ye &lsquo;d tear a leaf out of a book. There &lsquo;s Mr. Maurice
now,&mdash;and I &lsquo;ll go and hurry the dinner, for he &lsquo;ll give us no peace
if we &lsquo;re a minute late.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The stranger&mdash;or, to give him his proper name, Mr. Merl&mdash;now
approached the window, and watched, not without admiration, the skilful
management by which Scanlan skimmed along the strand, zigzagging his smart
nag through all the awkward impediments of the way, and wending his tandem
through what appeared a labyrinth of confusion.
</p>
<p>
Men bred and born in great cities are somewhat prone to fancy that certain
accomplishments, such as tandem-driving, steeple-chasing, and such like,
are the exclusive acquirements of rank and station. They have only
witnessed them as the gifts of guardsmen and &ldquo;young squires of high
degree,&rdquo; never suspecting that in the country a very inferior class is
often endowed with these skilful arts. Mr. Merl felt, therefore, no
ordinary reverence for Maurice Scanlan, a sentiment fully reciprocated by
the attorney, as he beheld the gorgeous dressing-gown, rich tasselled cap,
and Turkish trousers of the other.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d arrive before you, sir,&rdquo; said Scanlan, with a profound bow,
as he entered the room; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m glad you got in first. What a shower that
was!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Shower!&rdquo; said Merl; &ldquo;a West India hurricane is a zephyr to it. I &lsquo;d not
live in this climate if you &lsquo;d give me the whole Martin estate!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;m sure of it, sir; one must be bred in the place, and know no better,
to stand it.&rdquo; And although the speech was uttered in all humility, Merl
gave the speaker a searching glance, as though to say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose your
time trying to humbug me; I&rsquo;m &lsquo;York,&rsquo; too.&rdquo; Indeed, there was species of
freemasonry in the looks that now passed between the two; each seemed
instinctively to feel that he was in the presence of an equal, and that
artifice and deceit might be laid aside for the nonce.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope you agree with me,&rdquo; said Scanlan, in a lower and more confidential
voice, &ldquo;that this was the best place to come to. Here you can stay as long
as you like, and nobody the wiser; but in the town of Oughterard they&rsquo;d be
at you morning, noon, and night, tracking your steps, questioning the
waiter, ay, and maybe taking a peep at your letters. I &lsquo;ve known that same
before now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I suppose you &lsquo;re right; only this place does look a little dull, I
confess.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the season, to be sure,&rdquo; said Scanlan, apologetically.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! and there is a season here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there, by George!&rdquo; said Maurice, smacking his lips. &ldquo;I &lsquo;ve seen two
heifers killed here of a morning, and not so much as a beefsteak to be got
before twelve o&rsquo;clock. &lsquo;T is the height of fashion comes down here in
July,&mdash;the Rams of Kiltimmon, and the Bodkins of Crossmaglin; and
there was talk last year of a lord,&mdash;I forget his name; but he ran
away from Newmarket, and the story went that he was making for this.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Any play?&rdquo; asked Merl.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Play is it? That there is; whist every night, and backgammon.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Merl threw up his eyebrows with pretty much the same feeling with which
the Great Napoleon repeated the words &ldquo;Bows and Arrows!&rdquo; as the weapons of
a force that offered him alliance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d allow me to dine in this trim, Mr. Scanlan,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d ask
you to order dinner.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was only waiting for you to give the word, sir,&rdquo; said Maurice,
reverting to the habit of respect at any fresh display of the other&rsquo;s
pretensions; and opening the door, he gave a shrill whistle.
</p>
<p>
The landlord himself answered the summons, and whispered a few words in
Scanlan&rsquo;s ear.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, always,&rdquo; cried Maurice, angrily. &ldquo;I never came into the house
for the last ten days without hearing the same story. I &lsquo;d like to know
who and what he is, that must always have the best that &lsquo;s going?&rdquo; Then
turning to Merl, he added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lodger he has upstairs; an old fellow
that came about a fortnight back; and if there&rsquo;s a fine fish or a fat
turkey or a good saddle of mutton to be got, he &lsquo;ll have it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faix, he pays well,&rdquo; said Toby, &ldquo;whoever he is.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And he has secured our salmon, I find, and left us to dine on whiting,&rdquo;
 said Maurice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;An eighteen-pound fish!&rdquo; echoed Toby; &ldquo;and it would be as much as my life
is worth to cut it in two.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s alone, too?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, sir. Mr. Crow, the painter, is to dine with him. He&rsquo;s making drawings
for him of all the wonderful places down the coast.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, give us what we &lsquo;re to have at once,&rdquo; said Maurice, angrily. &ldquo;The
basket of wine was taken out of the gig?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir; all right and ready for you; and barrin&rsquo; the fish you &lsquo;ll have
an elegant dinner.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This little annoyance over, the guests relished their fare like hungry
men; nor, time and place considered, was it to be despised.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Digestion is a great leveller.&rdquo; Mr. Merl and Mr. Scan-Ian felt far more
on an equality when, the dinner over and the door closed, they drew the
table close to the fire, and drank to each other in a glass of racy port.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I believe a man might live here, after all,&rdquo; said Merl, as he gazed
admiringly on the bright hues of his variegated lower garments.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;m proud to hear you say so,&rdquo; said Scanlan; &ldquo;for, of course, you&rsquo;ve
seen a deal of life; and when I say life, I mean fashion and high style,&mdash;nobs
and swells.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; I believe I have,&rdquo; said Merl, lighting his cigar; &ldquo;that was always
my &lsquo;line.&rsquo; I fancy there&rsquo;s few fellows going have more experience of the
really great world than Herman Merl.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you like it?&rdquo; asked Maurice, confidentially.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do, and I do not,&rdquo; said the Jew, hesitatingly. &ldquo;To one like myself, who
knows them all, always on terms of close intimacy,&mdash;friendship, I may
say,&mdash;it &lsquo;s all very well; but take a new hand just launched into
life, a fellow not of their own set,&mdash;why, sir, there &lsquo;s no name for
the insults and outrage he&rsquo;ll meet with.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But what could they do?&rdquo; asked Scanlan, inquiringly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What?&mdash;anything, everything; laugh at him, live on him, win his last
guinea,&mdash;and then, blackball him!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And could n&rsquo;t he get a crack at them?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t he have a shot at some of them, at least?&rdquo; asked Maurice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Mr. Merl, half contemptuously; &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t do <i>that</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faix! and we &lsquo;d do it down here,&rdquo; said Scanlan, &ldquo;devil may care who or
what he was that tried the game.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I &lsquo;m speaking of London and Paris; I &lsquo;m not alluding to the Sandwich
Islands,&rdquo; said Merl, on whose brain the port and the strong fire were
already producing their effects.
</p>
<p>
Scanlan&rsquo;s face flushed angrily; but a glance at the other checked the
reply he was about to make, and he merely pushed the decanter across the
table.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You see, sir,&rdquo; said Merl, in the tone of a man laying down a great
dictum, &ldquo;there &lsquo;s worlds and worlds. There&rsquo;s Claude Willoughby&rsquo;s world,
which is young Martin&rsquo;s and Stanhope&rsquo;s and mine. There, we are all young
fellows of fortune, good family, good prospects, you understand,&mdash;no,
thank you, no more wine;&mdash;I feel that what I &lsquo;ve taken has got into
my head; and this cigar, too, is none of the best. Would it be taking too
great a liberty with you if I were to snatch a ten minutes&rsquo; doze,&mdash;just
ten minutes?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Treat me like an old friend; make yourself quite at home,&rdquo; said Maurice.
&ldquo;There &lsquo;s enough here&rdquo;&mdash;and he pointed to the bottles on the table&mdash;&ldquo;to
keep me company; and I &lsquo;ll wake you up when I &lsquo;ve finished them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mr. Merl made no reply; but drawing a chair for his legs, and disposing
his drapery gracefully around him, he closed his eyes, and before Maurice
had replenished his glass, gave audible evidence of a sound sleep.
</p>
<p>
Now, worthy reader, we practise no deceptions with you; nor so far as we
are able, do we allow others to do so. It is but fair, therefore, to tell
you that Mr. Merl was not asleep, nor had he any tendency whatever to
slumber about him. That astute gentleman, however, had detected that the
port was, with the addition of a great fire, too much for him; he
recognized in himself certain indications of confusion that implied
wandering and uncertain faculties, and he resolved to arrest the progress
of such symptoms by a little repose. He felt, in short, that if he had
been engaged in play, that he should have at once &ldquo;cut out,&rdquo; and so he
resolved to give himself the advantage of the prerogative which attaches
to a tired traveller. There he lay, then, with closed eyes,&mdash;breathing
heavily,&mdash;to all appearance sound asleep.
</p>
<p>
Maurice Scanlan, meanwhile, scanned the recumbent figure before him with
the eye of a connoisseur. We have once before said that Mr. Scanlan&rsquo;s
jockey experiences had marvellously aided his worldly craft, and that he
scrutinized those with whom he came in contact through life, with all the
shrewd acumen he would have bestowed upon a horse whose purchase he
meditated. It was easy to see that the investigation puzzled him. Mr. Merl
did not belong to any one category he had ever seen before. Maurice was
acquainted with various ranks and conditions of men; but here was a new
order, not referable to any known class. He opened Captain Martin&rsquo;s
letter, which he carried in his pocket-book, and re-read it; but it was
vague and uninstructive. He merely requested that &ldquo;every attention might
be paid to his friend Mr. Merl, who wanted to see something of the West,
and know all about the condition of the people, and such like. He&rsquo;s up to
everything, Master Maurice,&rdquo; continued the writer, &ldquo;and so just the man
for <i>you</i>.&rdquo; There was little to be gleaned from this source, and so
he felt, as he folded and replaced the epistle in his pocket.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What can he be,&rdquo; thought Scanlan, &ldquo;and what brings him down here? Is he a
member of Parliament, that wants to make himself up about Ireland and
Irish grievances? Is he a money-lender, that wants to see the security
before he makes a loan? Are they thinking of him for the agency?&rdquo;&mdash;and
Maurice flushed as the suspicion crossed him,&mdash;&ldquo;or is it after Miss
Mary he is?&rdquo; And a sudden paleness covered his face at the thought. &ldquo;I &lsquo;d
give a cool hundred, this minute, if I could read you,&rdquo; said he to
himself, &ldquo;Ay, and I&rsquo;d not ask any one&rsquo;s help how to deal with us
afterwards,&rdquo; added he, as he drained off his glass. While he was thus
ruminating, a gentle tap was heard at the door, and, anxious not to
disturb the sleeper, Scanlan crossed the room with noiseless steps, and
opened it.
</p>

</div>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Simmy,&rdquo; said he, in a low voice. &ldquo;Come in, and make no
noise; he&rsquo;s asleep.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s him!&rdquo; said Crow, standing still to gaze on the recumbent
figure before him, which he scrutinized with all an artist&rsquo;s appreciation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, and what do you think of him?&rdquo; whispered Scanlan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That chap is a Jew,&rdquo; said Sim, in the same cautious tone. &ldquo;I know the
features well; you see the very image of him in the old Venetian pictures.
Whenever they wanted cunning and cruelty&mdash;but more cunning than
cruelty&mdash;they always took that type.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I would n&rsquo;t wonder if you were right, Simmy,&rdquo; said Scanlan, on whom a new
light was breaking.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know I am; look at the spread of the nostrils, and the thick, full
lips, and the coarse, projecting under-jaw. Faix!&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;I
‘ve seen the day I &lsquo;d like to have had a study of your face.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Scanlan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just so; he&rsquo;d make a great Judas!&rdquo; said Crow, enthusiastically. &ldquo;It is
the miser all over. You know,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;if one took him in the
historical way, you &lsquo;d get rid of the vulgarity, and make him grander and
finer; for, looking at him now, he might be a dog-stealer.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Scanlan gave a low, cautious laugh as he placed a chair beside his own for
the artist, and filled out for him a bumper of port.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was just dying for a glass of this,&rdquo; said Crow. &ldquo;I dined with Mr. Barry
upstairs; and though he&rsquo;s a fine-hearted old fellow in many respects, he&rsquo;s
too abstemious; a pint of sherry for two at dinner, and a pint of port
after, that&rsquo;s the allowance. Throw out as many hints as you like, suggest
how and what you will, but devil a drop more you&rsquo;ll get.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And who is he?&rdquo; asked Scanlan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish you could tell me,&rdquo; said Crow.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t a notion; nor what he is?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not the slightest. I think, indeed, he said he was in the army; but I&rsquo;m
not clear it wasn&rsquo;t a commissary or a surgeon; maybe he was, but he knows
a little about everything. Take him on naval matters, and he understands
them well; ask him about foreign countries,&mdash;egad, he was everywhere.
Ireland seems the only place new to him, and it won&rsquo;t be so long; for he
goes among the people, and talks to them, and hears all they have to say,
with a patience that breaks my heart. Like all strangers, he&rsquo;s astonished
with the acuteness he meets with, and never ceases saying, &lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t they a
wonderful people? Who ever saw their equal for intelligence?&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bother!&rdquo; said Scanlan, contemptuously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But it is not bother! Maurice; he&rsquo;s right. They are just what he says.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Arrah! don&rsquo;t be humbugging <i>me</i>, Mr. Crow,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;They
‘re a set of scheming, plotting vagabonds, that are unmanageable by any
one, except a fellow that has the key to them as I have.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>You</i> know them, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Crow, half apologetically, for
he liked the port, and did not feel he ought to push contradiction too
far.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s more than your friend Barry does, or ever will,&rdquo; said Scanlan.
&ldquo;I defy an Englishman&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care how shrewd he is&mdash;to
understand Paddy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A slight movement on Mr. Merl&rsquo;s part here admonished the speaker to speak
lower.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; continued Maurice, &ldquo;that fellow there&mdash;whoever he is or
whatever he is&mdash;is no fool! he &lsquo;s deep enough; and yet there &lsquo;s not a
bare-legged gossoon on the estate I won&rsquo;t back to take him in.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But Barry&rsquo;s another kind of man entirely. You wouldn&rsquo;t call him cute or
cunning; but he&rsquo;s a sensible, well-judging man, that has seen a deal of
life.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what is it, he says, brings him here?&rdquo; asked Scanlan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He never said a word about that yet,&rdquo; replied Crow, &ldquo;further than his
desire to visit a country he had heard much of, and, if I understand him
aright, where some of his ancestors came from; for, you see, at times he&rsquo;s
not so easy for one to follow, for he has a kind of a foreign twang in his
tongue, and often mumbles to himself in a strange language.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I mistrust all these fellows that go about the world, pretending they
want to see this and observe that,&rdquo; said Scanlan, sententiously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty hard to mistrust a man that gives you the likes of that,&rdquo;
 said Crow, as he drew a neatly folded banknote from his pocket, and handed
it to Scanlan. &ldquo;Twenty pounds! And he gave you that?&rdquo; &ldquo;This very evening.
‘It is a little more than our bargain, Mr. Crow,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but not more
than I can afford to give; and so I hope you &lsquo;ll not refuse it.&rsquo; These
were his words, as he took my lot of drawings&mdash;poor daubs they were&mdash;and
placed them in his portfolio.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So that he is rich?&rdquo; said Maurice, pensively, &ldquo;There seems no end of his
money; there&rsquo;s not a day goes over he does n&rsquo;t spend fifteen or sixteen
pounds in meat, potatoes, barley, and the like. Sure, you may say he &lsquo;s
been feeding the two islands himself for the last fortnight; and what&rsquo;s
more, one must n&rsquo;t as much as allude to it. He gets angry at the slightest
word that can bring the subject forward. It was the other day he said to
myself, &lsquo;If you can relieve destitution without too much parade of its
sufferings, you are not only obviating the vulgar display of rich
benevolence, but you are inculcating high sentiments and delicacy of
feeling in those that are relieved. Take care how you pauperize the heart
of a people, for you &lsquo;ll have to make a workhouse of the nation.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sure, they&rsquo;re paupers already!&rdquo; exclaimed Scanlan, contemptuously. &ldquo;When
I hear all these elegant sentiments uttered about Ireland, I know a man is
an ass! This is a poor country,&mdash;the people is poor, the gentry is
poor, the climate is n&rsquo;t the best, and bad as it is, you &lsquo;re never sure of
it. All that anybody can hope to do is to make his living out of it; but
as to improving it,&mdash;raising the intellectual standard of the people,
and all that balderdash we hear of,&mdash;you might just as well tell me
that there was an Act of Parliament to make everybody in Connaught six
feet high. Nature says one thing, and it signifies mighty little if the
House of Commons says the other.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you &lsquo;re telling me this in the very spot that contradicts every word
you say!&rdquo; cried Crow, half angrily; for the port had given him courage,
and the decanter waxed low.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; exclaimed Scanlan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here, where we sit&mdash;on this very estate of Cro&rsquo; Martin&mdash;where a
young girl&mdash;a child the other day&mdash;has done more to raise the
condition of the people, to educate and civilize, than the last six
generations together.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A long wailing whistle from Scanlan was the insulting reply to the
assertion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; cried Crow, passionately.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I mean that she has done more mischief to the property than
five-and-forty years&rsquo; good management will ever repair, Now don&rsquo;t be
angry, Simmy; keep your temper, and draw your chair back again to the
table. I &lsquo;m not going to say one word against her intentions; but when I
see the waste of thousands of pounds on useless improvements, elegant
roads that lead nowhere, bridges that nobody will ever pass, and harbors
without boats, not to say the habits of dependence the people have got by
finding everything done for them. I tell you again, ten years more of Miss
Mary&rsquo;s rule will finish the estate.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0005" id="linkimage-0005">

</div>
<p>
alt="130 &ldquo;>
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it!&rdquo; blurted out Simmy, boldly. &ldquo;I saw her
yesterday coming out of a cabin, where she passed above an hour, nursing
typhus fever and cholera. The cloak she took off the door&mdash;for she
left it there to dry&mdash;was still soaked with rain; her wet hair hung
down her shoulders, and as she stood bridling her own pony,&mdash;for
there was not a living soul to help her&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She &lsquo;d have made an elegant picture,&rdquo; broke in Scanlan, with a laugh.
&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s exactly the fault of us in Ireland,&mdash;we are all
picturesque; I wish we were prosperous! But come, Simmy, finish your wine;
it&rsquo;s not worth disputing about. If all I hear about matters be true, there
will be very little left of Cro&rsquo; Martin when the debts are paid.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What! do you mean to say that they &lsquo;re in difficulty?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Far worse; the stories that reach me call it&mdash;ruin!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Simmy drew his chair closer to the table, and in a whisper scarcely
breathed, said, &ldquo;That chap&rsquo;s not asleep, Maurice.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; whispered the other; and added, aloud, &ldquo;Many a fellow that
thinks he has the first charge on the property will soon discover his
mistake; there are mortgages of more than eighty years&rsquo; standing on the
estate. You&rsquo;ve had a great sleep, sir,&rdquo; said he, addressing Merl, who now
yawned and opened his eyes; &ldquo;I hope our talking did n&rsquo;t disturb you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; said Merl, rising and stretching his legs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all
right now, and quite fresh for anything.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let me introduce Mr. Crow to you, sir,&mdash;a native artist that we &lsquo;re
all proud of.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what you are not then,&rdquo; said Crow; &ldquo;nor would you be if I
deserved it. You &lsquo;d rather gain a cause at the Quarter Sessions, or take
in a friend about a horse, than be the man that painted the Madonna at
Florence.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s cross this evening,&mdash;cross and ill-humored,&rdquo; said Scanlan,
laughing. &ldquo;Maybe he &lsquo;ll be better tempered when we have tea.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was just going to ask for it,&rdquo; said Merl, as he arranged his whiskers,
and performed a small impromptu toilet before the glass, while Simmy
issued forth to give the necessary orders.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We &lsquo;ll have tea, and a rubber of dummy afterwards,&rdquo; said Scanlan, &ldquo;if
you&rsquo;ve no objection.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Whatever you like,&mdash;I &lsquo;m quite at your disposal,&rdquo; replied Merl, who
now seated himself with an air of bland amiability, ready, according to
the amount of the stake, to win pounds or lose sixpences.

<h2>
CHAPTER XI. MR. MERL &ldquo;AT FENCE&rdquo;
 </h2>
<p>
All the projects which Mr. Scanlan had struck out for Merl&rsquo;s occupation on
the following day were marred by the unfavorable weather. It blew fiercely
from the westward, driving upon shore a tremendous sea, and sending white
masses of drift and foam far inland. The rain, too, came down in torrents.
The low-lying clouds, which scarcely reached more than half-way up the
mountain sides, seemed as if rent asunder at times, and from them came a
deluge, filling all the watercourses, and swelling rivulets to the size of
mighty torrents. The unceasing roll of thunder, now near, now rumbling
along in distant volleys, swelled the wild uproar, and helped to make up a
scene of grand but desolate meaning.
</p>
<p>
What could well be drearier than that little line of cabins that formed
the village of Kilkieran, as with strongly barricaded doors, and with
roofs secured by ropes and spars, they stood exposed to the full violence
of the wild Atlantic! Not a man, not a living thing was to be seen. The
fishermen were all within doors, cowering in gloomy indolence over the
scanty turf fires, and brooding darkly on the coming winter.
</p>
<p>
With a thorough conviction of all the dreariness of this scene, Mr. Merl
stood at the window and looked out. He had been all his life too actively
engaged in his pursuits of one kind or other to know much about what is
called &ldquo;being bored.&rdquo; Let rain fall ever so heavily, a cab could take him
down to &ldquo;&lsquo;Change,&rdquo;&mdash;the worst weather never marred a sale of stock,
and Consols could rise even while the mercury was falling. The
business-life of a great city seems to care little for weather, and
possibly they whose intent faculties are bent on gain, scarcely remember
whether the sun shines upon their labors.
</p>
<p>
Merl felt differently now; the scene before him was wilder and gloomier
than anything he had ever beheld. Beyond and behind the village steep
mountains rose on every side, of barren and rugged surface,&mdash;not a
vestige of any culture to be seen; while on the road, which led along a
narrow gorge, nothing moved. All was dreary and deserted.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll keep the roof over you to-day, Mr. Merl?&rdquo; said Scanlan,
as he entered the room, buttoned up to the chin in a coarse frieze coat,
while his head was protected by a genuine &ldquo;sou&rsquo;-wester&rdquo; of oilskin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And are <i>you</i> going out in such weather?&rdquo; asked Merl.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Needs must,&rsquo; sir, as the proverb says. I have to be at the assizes at
Oughterard this morning, to prosecute some scoundrels for cutting brambles
in the wood; and I want to serve notices on a townland about eight miles
from this; and then I &lsquo;ll have to go round by Cro&rsquo; Martin and see Miss
Mary. That&rsquo;s not the worst of it,&rdquo; added he, with an impudent leer, &ldquo;for
she&rsquo;s a fine girl, and has the prettiest eyes in the kingdom.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have a letter for her,&rdquo; said Merl,&mdash;&ldquo;a letter of introduction from
Captain Martin. I suppose I might as well send it by you, and ask if I
might pay my respects to-morrow or next day?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure; I&rsquo;ll take it with pleasure. You&rsquo;ll like her when you see her.
She&rsquo;s not a bit like the rest: no pride, no stand-off,&mdash;that is, when
she takes a fancy; but she is full of life and courage for anything.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, yes,&mdash;the Captain said we should get on very well together,&rdquo;
 drawled out Merl.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did he, though!&rdquo; cried Scanlan, eagerly. Then as suddenly checking his
anxiety, he added: &ldquo;But what does <i>he</i> know about Miss Mary? Surely
they&rsquo;re as good as strangers to each other. And for the matter of that,
even when he was here, they did n&rsquo;t take to each other,&mdash;she was
always laughing at the way he rode.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t he in the dragoons?&rdquo; asked Merl, in a half-rebutting tone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So he was; but what does that signify? Sure it&rsquo;s not a cavalry seat, with
your head down and your elbows squared, will teach you to cross country,&mdash;at
least, with Mary Martin beside you. You&rsquo;ll see her one of these day
yourself, Mr. Merl. May I never, if you don&rsquo;t see her now!&rdquo; cried Scanlan,
suddenly, as he pointed to the road along which a horse was seen coming at
speed, the rider breasting the storm fearlessly, and only crouching to the
saddle as the gusts swept past. &ldquo;What in the name of all that&rsquo;s wonderful
brings her here?&rdquo; cried Maurice. &ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t down at Kilkieran for four
months.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll stop at this inn here, I suppose?&rdquo; said Merl who was already
performing an imaginary toilet for her visit.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You may take your oath she&rsquo;ll not!&rdquo; said Scanlan half roughly; &ldquo;she &lsquo;d
not cross the threshold of it! She &lsquo;s going to some cabin or other. There
she goes,&mdash;is n&rsquo;t that riding?&rdquo; cried he, in animation. &ldquo;Did you ever
see a horse held neater? And see how she picks the road for him! Easy as
she&rsquo;s sitting, she &lsquo;d take a four-foot wall this minute, without stirring
in her saddle.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t got a nice day for pleasuring!&rdquo; said the Jew, with a vulgar
cackle.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If ye call it pleasure,&rdquo; rejoined Scanlan, &ldquo;what she&rsquo;s after; but I
suspect there&rsquo;s somebody sick down at the end of the village. There, I &lsquo;m
right; she&rsquo;s pulling up at Mat Landy&rsquo;s,&mdash;I wonder if it&rsquo;s old Mat is
bad.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You know him?&rdquo; asked Merl.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure I do. He &lsquo;s known down the coast for forty miles. He saved
more men from shipwreck himself than everybody in the barony put together;
but his heart is all but broke about a granddaughter that ran away. Sure
enough, she&rsquo;s going in there.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did you see Miss Mary?&rdquo; cried Crow, entering suddenly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just gone
down the beach. They say there&rsquo;s a case now down there.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A case&mdash;of what?&rdquo; said Merl.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Cholera or typhus, as it may be,&rdquo; said Crow, not a little surprised at
the unmistakable terror of the other&rsquo;s face.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And she&rsquo;s gone to see it!&rdquo; exclaimed the Jew.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To do more than see it. She &lsquo;ll nurse the sick man, and bring him
medicine and whatever he wants.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And not afraid?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Afraid!&rdquo; broke in Crow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what she&rsquo;s afraid of. Ask Mr.
Scanlan what would frighten her.&rdquo; But Mr. Scanlan had already slipped
noiselessly from the room, and was already on his way down the shore.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Merl, lighting his cigar, and drawing an arm-chair close to
the fire, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the advantage of all that. She could send the
doctor, I suppose, and make her servants take down to these people
whatever she wanted to send them. What especial utility there is in going
herself, I can&rsquo;t perceive.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, then,&rdquo; said Crow. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more likely the doctor is busy
this minute, ten or fifteen miles away,&mdash;for the whole country is
down in sickness; but even if he was n&rsquo;t, if it were not for her courage
in going everywhere, braving danger and death every hour, there would be a
general flight of all that could escape. They&rsquo;d rush into the towns,&mdash;where
already there&rsquo;s more sickness than they know how to deal with. She
encourages some,&mdash;she shames more; and not a few are proud to be
brave in such company, for she is an angel,&mdash;that&rsquo;s her name,&mdash;an
angel.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I should like to see her,&rdquo; drawled out Merl, as he smoothed down
his scrubby mustachios.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing easier, then,&rdquo; rejoined Crow. &ldquo;Put on your coat and hat, and we
‘ll stroll down the beach till she comes out; it can&rsquo;t be very long, for
she has enough on her hands elsewhere.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The proposition of a &ldquo;stroll&rdquo; in such weather was very little to Mr.
Merl&rsquo;s taste; but his curiosity was stronger than even his fear of a
drenching, and having muffled and shawled himself as if for an Arctic
winter, they set out together from the inn.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you tell me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that the Martins used to live here,&mdash;actually
pass their lives in this atrocious climate?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That they did,&mdash;and the worst mistake they ever made was to leave
it,&rdquo; said Crow.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I confess you puzzle me,&rdquo; said Merl.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very possibly I do, sir,&rdquo; was the calm reply; &ldquo;but you&rsquo;d have understood
me at once had you known this country while they resided at Cro&rsquo; Martin.
It was n&rsquo;t only that the superfluities of their wealth ran over, and
filled the cup of the poor man, but there was a sense of hope cherished,
by seeing that however hard the times, however adverse the season, there
was always &lsquo;his Honor,&rsquo; as they called Mr. Martin, whom they could appeal
to for aid or for lenient treatment.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very strange, very odd, all this,&rdquo; said Merl, musing. &ldquo;But all that I
hear of Ireland represents the people as if in a continual struggle for
mere existence, and actually in a daily state of dependence on the will of
somebody above them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And if that same condition were never to be exaggerated into downright
want, or pushed to an actual slavery, we could be very happy with it,&rdquo;
 said Crow, &ldquo;and not thank you, or any other Englishman that came here, to
disturb it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I assure you I have no ambition to indulge in any such interference,&rdquo;
 said Merl, with a half-contemptuous laugh.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And so you&rsquo;re not thinking of settling in Ireland?&rdquo; asked Crow, in some
surprise.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never dreamed of it!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, the story goes that you wanted to buy an estate, and came down to
have a look at this property here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d not live on it if Martin were to make me a present of it to-morrow.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he will,&rdquo; said Crow, gravely. &ldquo;I am afraid he could n&rsquo;t, if
he wished it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What, do you mean on account of the entail?&rdquo; asked Merl.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not exactly.&rdquo; He paused, and after some silence said, &ldquo;If the truth were
told, there&rsquo;s a great deal of debt on this property,&mdash;more than any
one suspects.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Captain&rsquo;s encumbrances?&rdquo; asked Merl, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;His grandfather&rsquo;s and his great-grandfather&rsquo;s! As for the present man,
they say that he&rsquo;s tied up some way not to sell, except for the sake of
redeeming some of the mortgages. But who knows what is true and what is
false about all this?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Merl was silent; grave fears were crossing his mind how far his claims
were valid; and terrible misgivings shot across him lest the Captain might
have been paying him with valueless securities.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I gather from what you say,&rdquo; said he, at last, &ldquo;that it would be rather
difficult to make out a title for any purchaser of this estate.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid of that, sir. They&rsquo;ll make you out a fair title.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I tell you again, I&rsquo;d not take it as a present,&rdquo; said Merl, half angrily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Crow, nodding his head sententiously. And then fixing his
eyes steadily on him, he said, &ldquo;You are a mortgagee.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Merl reddened,&mdash;partly anger, partly shame. Indeed, the feeling that
such a capacity as Mr. Crow&rsquo;s should have pushed him hard, was anything
but complimentary to his self-esteem.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to pry into any man&rsquo;s affairs,&rdquo; said Crow, easily. &ldquo;Heaven
knows it&rsquo;s mighty little matter to Simmy Crow who lives in the big house
there. I &lsquo;d rather, if I had my choice, be able to walk the wood with my
sketch-book and brushes than be the richest man that ever was heartsore
with the cares of wealth.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And if a friend&mdash;a sincere, well-wishing friend&mdash;were to bind
himself that you should enjoy this same happiness you speak of, Mr. Crow,
what would you do in return?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Anything he asked me,&mdash;anything, at least, that a fair man could
ask, and an honest one could do.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my hand on it, then,&rdquo; said Merl. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bargain.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, but let us hear the conditions,&rdquo; said Crow. &ldquo;What could I possibly
serve you in, that would be worth this price?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Simply this: that you&rsquo;ll answer all my inquiries, so far as you know
about this estate; and where your knowledge fails, that you&rsquo;ll endeavor to
obtain the information for me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe I could tell you nothing at all&mdash;or next to nothing,&rdquo; said
Crow. &ldquo;Just ask me, now, what&rsquo;s the kind of question you &lsquo;d put; for, to
tell truth, I &lsquo;m not over bright or clever,&mdash;the best of me is when
I&rsquo;ve a canvas before me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Merl peered stealthily at the speaker over the great folds of the shawl
that enveloped his throat; he was not without his misgivings that the
artist was a &ldquo;deep fellow,&rdquo; assuming a manner of simplicity to draw him
into a confidence. &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;had he really been shrewd and
cunning, he &lsquo;d never have blurted out his suspicion as to my being a
mortgagee. Besides,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;there, and with that fact, must
end all his knowledge of me.&rdquo; &ldquo;You can dine with me to-day, Mr. Crow,
can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;m engaged to the stranger in No. 4,&mdash;the man I&rsquo;m making the
drawings for.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But you could get off. You could ask him to excuse you by saying that
something of importance required you elsewhere?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And dine in the room underneath?&rdquo; asked Crow, with a comical look of
distress at this suggestion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, let us go somewhere else. Is there no other inn in the
neighborhood?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a small public-house near the gate of Cro&rsquo; Martin, to be sure.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll dine there. I&rsquo;ll order a chaise at four o&rsquo;clock, and we &lsquo;ll
drive over together. And now, I &lsquo;ll just return to the house, for this
wading here is not much to my taste.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mr. Merl returned gloomily to the house, his mind too deeply occupied with
his own immediate interests to bestow any thought upon Mary Martin. The
weather assuredly offered but little inducement to linger out of doors,
for, as the morning wore on, the rain and wind increased in violence,
while vast masses of mist swept over the sea and were carried on shore,
leaving only, at intervals, little patches of the village to be seen,&mdash;dreary,
storm-beaten, and desolate! Merl shuddered, as he cast one last look at
this sad-colored picture, and entered the inn.
</p>
<p>
Has it ever been your ill-fortune, good reader, to find yourself alone in
some dreary, unfrequented spot, the weather-bound denizen of a sorry inn,
without books or newspapers, thrown upon the resources of your own
thoughts, so sure to take their color from the dreary scene around them?
It is a trying ordeal for the best of tempers. Your man of business chafes
and frets against the inactivity; your man of leisure sorrows over
monotony that makes idleness a penalty. He whose thoroughfare in life is
the pursuit of wealth thinks of all those more fortunate than himself then
hurrying on to gain, while he who is the mark of the world&rsquo;s flatteries
and attentions laments over the dismal desolation of an uncompanionable
existence.
</p>
<p>
If Mr. Merl did not exactly occupy any one of these categories, he
fancied, at least, that he oscillated amidst them all. It was, indeed, his
good pleasure to imagine himself a &ldquo;man upon town,&rdquo; who played a little,
discounted a little, dealt a little in old pictures, old china, old
cabinets, and old plate, but all for mere pastime,&mdash;something, as he
would say, &ldquo;to give him an interest in it;&rdquo; and there, certainly, he was
right. Nothing so surely imparted an &ldquo;interest&rdquo; in Mr. Merl&rsquo;s eyes as
having an investment. Objects of art, the greatest triumphs of genius,
landscape the richest eye ever ranged over, political events that would
have awakened a sense of patriotism in the dullest and coldest, all came
before him as simple questions of profit and loss.
</p>
<p>
If he was not actually a philosopher, some of his views of life were
characterized by great shrewdness. He had remarked, for instance, that the
changeful fashions of the world are ever alternating; and that not only
dress and costume and social customs undergo mutations, but that objects
of positive sterling value are liable to the same wayward influences. We
are all modern to-day, to-morrow we may be &ldquo;Louis Quatorze,&rdquo; the next day
&ldquo;Cinque Centi&rdquo; in our tastes. Now we are mad after Italian art, yesterday
the Dutch school was in vogue. Our galleries, our libraries, our houses,
our gardens, all feel the caprices of these passing moods. There was but
one thing that Mr. Merl had perceived never changed, and that was the
estimation men felt for money. Religions might decay, and states crumble,
thrones totter, and kings be exiled, Cuyps might be depreciated and
marquetry be held in mean esteem; but gold was always within a fraction at
least of four pounds eleven shillings the ounce!
</p>
<p>
He remarked, too, that men gradually grow tired of almost everything; the
pursuits of the young are not those of the middle-aged, still less of
advanced life. The books which we once cried over are now thrown down with
languor; the society we imagined perfection we now smile at for its very
absurdities. We see vulgarity where we once beheld vigor; we detect
exaggeration where we used to attribute power. There is only one theme of
which our estimation never varies,&mdash;wealth! Mr. Merl had never yet
met the man nor the woman who really despised it; nay, he had seen kings
trafficking on &lsquo;Change. He had known great ministers deep speculators on
the Bourse; valiant admirals, distinguished generals, learned judges, and
even divines, had bought and sold with him, all eager in the pursuit of
gain, and all employing, to the best of their ability, the high faculties
of their intelligence to assist them in making crafty bargains.
</p>
<p>
If these experiences taught him the universal veneration men feel for
wealth, they also conveyed another lesson, which was, the extreme
gullibility of mankind. He met every day men who ruled cabinets and
commanded fleets,&mdash;the reputed great of the earth,&mdash;and saw them
easier victims in his hand than the commonest capacity in &ldquo;Leadenhall
Street.&rdquo; They had the earliest information, but could not profit by it;
they never understood the temper on &lsquo;Change, knew nothing of the
variations of the money-barometer, and invariably fell into snares that
your city man never incurred. Hence Mr. Merl came to conceive a very low
general opinion of what he himself called &ldquo;the swells,&rdquo; and a very high
one of Herman Merl.
</p>
<p>
If we have dwelt upon these traits of this interesting individual in this
place, it is simply to place before our reader&rsquo;s mind the kind of
lucubrations such a man might be disposed to indulge in. In fact,
story-tellers like ourselves have very little pretension to go beyond the
narrow limit; and having given to the reader the traits of a character,
they must leave their secret working more or less to his ingenuity. So
much, however, we are at liberty to declare, that Mr. Merl was terribly
bored, and made no scruple of confessing it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What the deuce are you staring at? Is there anything really to be seen in
that confounded dreary sea?&rdquo; cried he, as Crow stood shading his eyes from
the lightning flashes, and intently gazing on the scene without.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the effects Backhuysen was so fond of!&rdquo; exclaimed Crow,
eagerly,&mdash;&ldquo;a sullen sea, lead-colored and cold, with a white curl
just crisping the top of the waves, over it a dreary expanse of dark sky,
low-lying and black, till you come near the horizon, where there is a
faint line of grayish white, just enough to show that you are on the wide,
wide ocean, out of sight of land, and nothing living near, except that
solitary sea-gull perched upon the breakers there. There&rsquo;s real poetry in
a bit like that; it sets one a thinking over the desolation of those whose
life is little better than a voyage on such a sea!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Better be drowned at once,&rdquo; broke in Merl, impatiently.
</p>
<p>
Crow started and looked at him; and had Merl but seen that glance, so
scornful and contemptuous was it, even his self-esteem might have felt
outraged. But he had not remarked it; and as little did he guess what was
then passing in the poor artist&rsquo;s mind, as Crow muttered to himself, &ldquo;I
know one that will not be your guest to-day, if he dines on a cold potato,
or does n&rsquo;t dine at all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did I tell you,&rdquo; cried he, suddenly, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s no horses to be had?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No horses!&rdquo; exclaimed Merl; &ldquo;how so?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a great trial going on at the assizes to-day, and Mr. Barry is
gone on to Oughterard to hear it, and he has the only pair of posters in
the place.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What a confounded hole!&rdquo; burst out Merl, passionately. &ldquo;That I ever
should have set my foot in it! How are we to get through the day here?
Have you thought of anything to be done?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> go down and find out how poor Landy is,&rdquo; said Crow; &ldquo;for Miss
Mary&rsquo;s horse is still at the door, and he must be very bad, indeed, or she
wouldn&rsquo;t delay so long.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what if it should turn out the cholera, or typhus, or something as
bad?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Crow, interrogatively; for he could not guess the drift of
the suggestion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Simply this, my worthy friend,&rdquo; resumed Merl,&mdash;&ldquo;that I have no fancy
for the pleasure of your company at dinner after such an excursion as you
speak of.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was just going to say that myself,&rdquo; said Crow. &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; And before
Merl could interpose a word, he was gone.

<h2>
CHAPTER XII. MR. MERL&rsquo;S MEDITATIONS.
</h2>
<p>
Our last chapter left Mr. Herman Merl in bad company,&mdash;he was alone.
Now, very few men&rsquo;s thoughts are companionable in the dreary solitude of a
sorry inn. None of us, it is to be feared, are totally exempt from &ldquo;this
world&rsquo;s crosses;&rdquo; and though the sorrows of life do fall very unequally,
the light afflictions are accepted as very heavy burdens by those to whose
lot they fall!
</p>
<p>
Just as it happens, then, on some gloomy day of winter, when we have
&ldquo;finished our book,&rdquo; and the newspapers are tiresome, we take the
opportunity to look through our letters and papers,&mdash;to arrange our
desk, and put a little order in our scattered and littered memoranda,&mdash;somewhat
in the same spirit will Conscience grasp a similar moment to go over the
past, glance at bygone events, and make, as it were, a clearance of
whatever weighs upon our memory. I &lsquo;m not quite certain that the best of
us come out of this Bankruptcy Court with a first-class certificate. Even
the most merciful to his own errors will acknowledge that in many things
he should do differently were they to be done over again; and he must,
indeed, have fallen upon a happy lot in life who has not some
self-reproach on the score of kindness unrequited,&mdash;slight injuries
either unforgiven or unequally avenged,&mdash;friendships jeopardized,
mayhap lost, by some mere indulgence of temper,&mdash;and enmities
unreconciled, just for lack of the veriest sacrifice of self-love.
</p>
<p>
Were there any such court in morals as in law, what a sad spectacle would
our schedule show, and how poor even the most solvent amongst us, if
called on for a list of his liabilities!
</p>
<p>
Lest our moralizing should grow uncomfortable, dear reader, let us return
to Mr. Merl, now occupied, as he was, in this same process of
self-examination. He sat with a little note-book before him, recalling
various incidents of the past. And if the lowering expression of his face
might be trusted, his reveries were not rose-colored; and yet, as he
turned over the pages, it might be seen that moments of gratulation
alternated with the intervals of self-reproach.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wednesday, the 10th,&rdquo; muttered he to himself, &ldquo;dined at Philippe&rsquo;s&mdash;supped
with Arkright and Bailey&mdash;whist at double Nap. points&mdash;won four
hundred and ten&mdash;might have made it a thousand, but B. flung the
cards out of the window in a passion, and had to cease playing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thursday&mdash;toothache&mdash;stayed at home, and played piquet with
myself&mdash;discovered two new combinations, in taking in cards&mdash;Irving
came to see me&mdash;won from him twenty pounds his mother had just sent
him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Friday&mdash;a good day&rsquo;s work&mdash;walked into Martin for two thousand
seven hundred, and took his bill at three months, with promise to renew&mdash;dined
with Sitwell, and sold him my Perugino for six hundred&mdash;cost myself
not as many francs&mdash;am to have the refusal of all Vanderbrett&rsquo;s
cabinets for letting him off his match with Columbine, which, by the way,
he was sure to win, as Mope is dead lame.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Martin again&mdash;Saturday&mdash;came to have his revenge, but seemed
quarrelsome; so I affected an engagement, and declined play.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sunday&mdash;gave him his revenge, to the tune of twelve hundred in my
own favor&mdash;&lsquo;Lansquenet&rsquo; in the evening at his rooms&mdash;several
swells present&mdash;thought it prudent to drop some tin, and so, lost one
hundred and forty Naps.&mdash;Sir Giles Bruce the chief winner&mdash;rich,
and within two months of being of age.

as to these same Irish securities and post-obits, involving, as they do, a
heavy sum.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mr. Merl paused at this <i>entrée</i> in his diary, and began to reflect
in no very gratulatory mood on the little progress he had as yet made in
this same object of inquiry; in fact, he was just discovering what a vast
number of more shrewd observers than himself have long since found out,
that exploring in Ireland is rather tough work. Everything looks so easy
and simple and plain upon the surface, and yet is so puzteling and
complicated beneath; all seems so intelligible, where there is nothing in
reality that is not a contradiction. It is true he was not harassing
himself with problems of labor and wages, the condition of the people, the
effects of emigration, and so forth. He wanted to ascertain some few facts
as to the value of a certain estate, and what incumbrances it might be
charged with; and to the questions he put on this head, every reply was an
insinuated interrogatory to himself. &ldquo;Why are <i>you</i> here, Mr. Merl?&rdquo;
 &ldquo;How does it concern <i>you?</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;What may be <i>your</i> interest in the
same investigation?&rdquo; This peculiar dialectic met him as he landed; it
followed him to the West. Scanlan, the landlord, even that poor simpleton
the painter&mdash;as he called Crow&mdash;had submitted him to its harsh
rule, till Mr. Merl felt that, instead of pursuing an examination, he was
himself everlastingly in the witness-box.
</p>
<p>
Wearied of these speculations, dissatisfied with himself and his fruitless
journey, he summoned the landlord to ask if that &ldquo;old gent&rdquo; above stairs
had not a book of some kind, or a newspaper, he could lend him. A ragged
urchin speedily returned with a key in his hand, saying, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the key
of No. 4. Joe says you may go up and search for yourself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
One more scrupulous might not exactly have fancied the office thus
suggested to him. He, however, was rather pleased with the investigation,
and having satisfied himself that the mission was safe, set forth to
fulfil it. No. 4, as the stranger&rsquo;s room was called, was a large and lofty
chamber, lighted by a single bay-window, the deep recess of which was
occupied by a writing-table. Books, maps, letters, and drawings littered
every part of the room. Costly weapons, too, such as richly chased daggers
and inlaid pistols, lay carelessly about, with curiously shaped pipes and
gold-embroidered tobacco-bags; a richly lined fur pelisse covered the
sofa, and a skull-cap of the very finest sable lay beside it. All these
were signs of affluence and comfort, and Mr. Merl pondered over them as he
went from place to place, tossing over one thing after another, and losing
himself in wild conjectures about the owner.
</p>
<p>
The writing-table, we have said, was thickly strewn with letters, and to
these he now addressed himself in all form, taking his seat comfortably
for the investigation. Many of the letters were in foreign languages, and
from remote and far-away lands. Some he was enabled to spell out, but they
referred to places and events he had never heard of, and were filled with
allusions he could not fathom. At length, however, he came to documents
which interested him more closely. They were notes, most probably in the
stranger&rsquo;s own hand, of his late tour along the coast. Mournful records
were they all,&mdash;sad stories of destitution and want, a whole people
struck down by famine and sickness, and a land perishing in utter misery.
No personal narrative broke the dreary monotony of these gloomy records,
and Merl searched in vain for what might give a clew to the writer&rsquo;s
station or his object. Carefully drawn-up statistics, tables of the
varying results of emigration, notes upon the tenure of land and the price
of labor were all there, interspersed with replies from different quarters
to researches of the writer&rsquo;s making. Numerous appeals to charity,
entreaties for small loans of money, were mingled with grateful
acknowledgments for benefits already received. There was much, had he been
so minded, that Mr. Merl might have learned in this same unauthorized
inquiry. There were abundant traits of the people displayed, strange
insight into customs and ways peculiar to them, accurate knowledge, too,
of the evils of their social condition; and, above all, there were the
evidences of that curious compound of credulity and distrust, hope and
fatalism, energy and inertness, which make up the Irish nature.
</p>
<p>
He threw these aside, however, as themes that had no interest for him.
What had he to do with the people? His care was with the soil, and less
even with it than with its burdens and incumbrances. One conviction
certainly did impress itself strongly upon him,&mdash;that he &lsquo;d part with
his claims on the estate for almost anything, in preference to himself
assuming the cares and duties of an Irish landlord,&mdash;a position which
he summed up by muttering to himself, &ldquo;is simply to have so many acres of
bad land, with the charge of feeding so many thousands of bad people.&rdquo;
 Here were suggestions, it is true, how to make them better, coupled with
details that showed the writer to be one well acquainted with the
difficulties of his task; here, also, were dark catalogues of crime,
showing how destitution and vice went hand in hand, and that the seasons
of suffering were those of lawlessness and violence. Various hands were
detectable in these documents. Some evinced the easy style and graceful
penmanship of education; others were written in the gnarled hand of the
daily, laborer. Many of these were interlined in what Merl soon detected
to be the stranger&rsquo;s own handwriting; and brief as such remarks were, they
sufficed to show how carefully their contents had been studied by him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What could be the object of all this research? Was he some emissary of
the Government, sent expressly to obtain this knowledge? Was he employed
by some section of party politicians, or was he one of those literary
philanthropists who trade upon the cheap luxury of pitying the poor and
detailing their sorrows? At all events,&rdquo; thought Mr. Merl, &ldquo;this same
information seems to have cost him considerable research, and not a little
money; and as I am under a pledge to give the Captain some account of his
dear country, here is a capital opportunity to do so, not only with ease,
but actually with honor.&rdquo; And having formed this resolve, he instantly
proceeded to its execution. That wonderful little note-book, with its
strong silver clasps, so full of strange and curious information, was now
produced; but he soon saw that the various facts to be recorded demanded a
wider space, and so he set himself to write down on a loose sheet of paper
notices of the land in tillage or in pasture, the numerical condition of
the people as compared with former years, their state, their prospects;
but when he came to tell of the ravages made and still making by
pestilence amongst them, he actually stopped to reread the records, so
terrible and astounding were the facts narrated. A dreadful malady walked
the land, and its victims lay in every house! The villages were
depopulated, the little clusters of houses at cross roads were stricken,
the lone shealing on the mountain side, the miserable cottage of the
dreary moor, were each the scenes of desolation and death. It was as
though the land were about to be devastated, and the race of man swept
from its surface! As he read on, he came upon some strictures in the
stranger&rsquo;s own hand upon these sad events, and perceived how terribly had
the deserted, neglected state of the people aided the fatal course of the
epidemic. No hospitals had been provided, no stores of any remedial kind,
not a doctor for miles around, save an old physician who had been retained
at Miss Martin&rsquo;s special charge, and who was himself nigh exhausted by the
fatigue of his office.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Merl laid down his pen to think,&mdash;not, indeed, in any
compassionate spirit of that suffering people; his sorrows were not for
those who lay on beds of want and sickness; his whole anxiety was for a
certain person very dear to his own heart, who had rashly accepted
securities on a property which, to all seeming, was verging upon ruin;
this conviction being strongly impressed by the lawless state of the
country, and the hopelessness of expecting payment from a tenantry so
circumstanced.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sympathy, indeed!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;I should like to hear of a little sympathy
for the unlucky fellow who has accepted a mortgage on this confounded
estate! These wretched creatures have little to lose,&mdash;and even death
itself ought to be no unwelcome relief to a life like theirs,&mdash;but to
a man such as I am, with abundance of projects for his spare cash, this is
a pretty investment! It is not impossible that this philanthropic
stranger, whoever he be, might buy up my bonds. He should have them a
bargain,&mdash;ay, by Jove! I&rsquo;d take off a jolly percentage to touch the
‘ready;&rsquo; and who knows, what with all his benevolence, his charity, and
his Christian kindliness, if he &lsquo;d not come down handsomely to rescue this
unhappy people from the hands of a Jew!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And Mr. Merl laughed pleasantly, for the conceit amused him, and it
sounded gratefully to his imagination that even his faith could be put out
to interest, and the tabernacle be turned to good account. The noise of a
chaise approaching at a sharp trot along the shingly beach startled him
from his musings, and he had barely time to snatch up the paper on which
he had scrawled his notes, and hasten downstairs, when the obsequious
landlord, rushing to the door, ushered in Mr. Barry, and welcomed him back
again.
</p>
<p>
Merl suffered his door to stand ajar, that he might take a look at the
stranger as he passed. He was a very large, powerfully built man, somewhat
stooped by age, but showing even in advanced years signs of a vigorous
frame and stout constitution; his head was massive, and covered with
snow-white hair, which descended on the back of his neck. His countenance
must in youth have been handsome, and even yet bore the expression of a
frank, generous, but somewhat impetuous nature,&mdash;so at least it
struck him who now observed it; a character not improbably aided by his
temper as he entered, for he had returned from scenes of misery and
suffering, and was in a mood of indignation at the neglect he had just
witnessed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You said truly,&rdquo; said he to the landlord. &ldquo;You told me I shouldn&rsquo;t see a
gentleman for twenty miles round; that all had fled and left the people to
their fate, and I see now it is a fact.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faix, and no wonder,&rdquo; answered the host. &ldquo;Wet potatoes and the shaking
ague, not to speak of cholera morbus, is n&rsquo;t great inducements to stay and
keep company with. I &lsquo;d be off, too, if I had the means.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I spoke of gentlemen, sir,&rdquo; said the stranger, with a strong emphasis
on the word,&mdash;&ldquo;men who should be the first to prove their birth and
blood when a season of peril was near.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thrue for you, sir,&rdquo; chimed in Joe, who suddenly detected the blunder he
had committed. &ldquo;The Martins ought not to have run away in the middle of
our distress.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They left the ship in a storm; they &lsquo;ll find a sorry wreck when they
return to it,&rdquo; muttered the stranger, as he ascended the stairs.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;By Jacob! just what I suspected,&rdquo; said Merl to himself, while he closed
the door; &ldquo;this property won&rsquo;t be worth sixpence, and I am regularly
‘done.&rsquo;&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER XIII. A NIGHT OF STORM
</h2>
<p>
The curtains were closely drawn, and a cheerful turf fire blazed in the
room where Mr. Merl sat at dinner. The fare was excellent, and even rustic
cookery sufficed to make fresh salmon and mountain mutton and fat
woodcocks delectable; while the remains of Mr. Scanlan&rsquo;s hamper set forth
some choice Madeira and several bottles of Sneyd&rsquo;s claret. Nor was he for
whose entertainment these good things were provided in any way incapable
of enjoying them. With the peculiar sensuality of his race, he loved his
dinner all to himself and alone. He delighted in the privileged
selfishness that isolation conferred, and he revelled in a sort of
complacent flattery at the thought of all the people who were dining worse
than himself, and the stray thousands besides who were not destined on
that day to dine at all.
</p>
<p>
The self-caressing shudder that came over him as the sound of a horse at
speed on the shore outside was heard, spoke plainly as words themselves
the pleasant comparison that crossed his mind between the condition of the
rider and his own. He drew nearer the fire, he threw on a fresh log of
pine, and, filling up a bumper, seemed to linger as he viewed it, as
though wishing health and innumerable blessings to Mr. Herman Merl.
</p>
<p>
The noise of the clattering hoofs died away in distance and in the greater
uproar of the storm, and Mr. Merl thought no more of them. How often
happens it, dear reader, that some brief interruption flashes through our
seasons of enjoyment; we are startled, perhaps; we even need a word or two
to reassure us that all is well, and then the work of pleasure goes on,
and we forget that it had ever been retarded; and yet, depend upon it, in
that fleeting second of time some sad episode of human life has, like a
spectre, crossed our path, and some deep sorrow gone wearily past us.
</p>
<p>
Let us follow that rider, then, who now, quitting the bleak shore, has
entered a deep gorge between the mountain. The rain swept along in
torrents; the wind in fitful gusts dashes the mountain stream in many a
wayward shape, and snaps the stems of old trees in pieces; landslips and
broken rocks impede the way; and yet that brave horse holds ever onward,
now stretching to a fast gallop, now gathering himself to clear some
foaming torrent, or some fragment of fallen timber.
</p>
<p>
The night is so dark that the rider cannot see the horse&rsquo;s length in
advance; but every feature of the way is well known, and an instinctive
sense of the peril to be apprehended at each particular spot guides that
hand and nerves that heart. Mary Martin&mdash;for she it is&mdash;had
ridden that same path at all seasons and all hours, but never on a wilder
night, nor through a more terrible hurricane than this. At moments her
speed relaxed, as if to breathe her horse; and twice she pulled up short,
to listen and distinguish between the sound of thunder and the crashing
noise of rocks rolling from the mountain. There was a sublimity in the
scene, lit up at moments by the lightning; and a sense of peril, too, that
exalted the adventurous spirit of the girl, and imparted to her heart a
high heroic feeling. The glorious sentiment of confronting danger animated
and excited her; and her courage rose with each new difficulty of the way,
till her very brain seemed to reel with the wild transport of her
emotions.
</p>
<p>
As she emerged from the gorge, she gained a high tableland, over which the
wind swept unimpeded. Not a cliff, not a rock, not a tree, broke the force
of the gale, which raged with all the violence of a storm at sea.
Crouching low upon the saddle, stooping at times to the mane, she could
barely make way against the hurricane; and more than once her noble
charger was driven backward, and forced to turn his back to the storm. <i>Her</i>
courage never failed. Taking advantage of every passing lull, she dashed
forward, ready to wheel and halt when the wind shot past with violence.
</p>
<p>
Descending at last from this elevated plateau, she again entered a deep
cleft between the mountain, the road littered with fallen earth and
branches of trees, so as almost to defy a passage. After traversing
upwards of a mile of this wearisome way, she arrived at the door of a
small cabin, the first trace of habitation since she had quitted the
village. It was a mere hovel, abutting against a rock, and in its dreary
solitude seemed the last refuge of direst poverty.
</p>
<p>
She bent down from her saddle to look in at the window; but, except some
faint embers on the hearth, all was dark within. She then knocked with her
whip against the door, and called &ldquo;Morris&rdquo; two or three times; but no
reply was given. Springing from her horse, Mary fastened the bridle to the
hasp of the door-post, and entered. The heavy breathing of one in deep
sleep at once caught her attention > and, approaching the fireplace, she
lighted a piece of pine-wood to examine about her. On a low settle in one
corner lay the figure of a young woman, whose pale, pinched features
contrasted strongly with the bright ribbons of her cap floating loosely at
either side. Mary tottered as she drew nigher; a terrible sense of fear
was over her,&mdash;a terror of she knew not what. She held the flickering
flame closer, and saw that she was dead! Poor Margaret, she had been one
of Mary&rsquo;s chief favorites; the very cap that now decked her cold forehead
was Mary&rsquo;s wedding-gift to her. But a few days before, her little child
had been carried to the churchyard; and it was said that the mother never
held up her head after. Sick almost to fainting, Mary Martin sank into a
chair, and then saw, for the first time, the figure of a man, who, half
kneeling, lay with his head on the foot of the bed, fast asleep!
Weariness, utter exhaustion, were marked in his pale-worn features, while
his attitude bespoke complete prostration. His hand still clasped a little
rosary.
</p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0006" id="linkimage-0006">

</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/156.jpg" width="100%" alt="156 " />
</div>
<p>
It seemed but the other day that she had wished them &ldquo;joy&rdquo; upon their
wedding, and they had gone home to their little cabin in hopefulness and
high-hearted spirit, and there she lay now a cold corpse, and he, bereaved
and childless. What a deal of sad philosophy do these words reveal! What
dark contrasts do we bring up when we say, &ldquo;It was but the other day.&rdquo; It
was but &ldquo;the other day,&rdquo; and Cro&rsquo; Martin was the home of one whose
thriving tenantry reflected back all his efforts for their welfare, when
movement and occupation bespoke a condition of activity and cheerful
industry; when, even in their poverty, the people bore bravely up, and the
cases of suffering but sufficed to call out traits of benevolence and kind
feeling. It was but &ldquo;the other day,&rdquo; and Mary herself rode out amidst the
people, like some beloved sovereign in the middle of her subjects; happy
faces beamed brighter when she came, and even misery half forgot itself in
her presence. But &ldquo;the other day&rdquo; and the flag waved proudly from the
great tower, to show that Cro&rsquo; Martin was the residence of its owner, and
Mary the life and soul of all that household!
</p>
<p>
Such-like were her thoughts as she stood still gazing on the sad scene
before her. She could not bring herself to awaken the poor fellow, who
thus, perchance, stole a short respite from his sorrows; but leaving some
money beside him on a chair, and taking one farewell look of poor
Margaret, she stole silently away, and remounted her horse.
</p>
<p>
Again she is away through the storm and the tempest! Her pace is now urged
to speed, for she knows every field and every fence,&mdash;where to press
her horse to his gallop, where to spare and husband his strength. At one
moment she steals carefully along amid fragments of fallen rocks and
broken timber; at another, she flies, with racing speed, over the smooth
sward. At length, through the gloom and darkness, the tall towers of Cro&rsquo;
Martin are seen over the deep woods; but her horse&rsquo;s head is not turned
thitherward. No; she has taken another direction, and, skirting the wall
of the demesne, she is off towards the wild, bleak country beyond. It is
past midnight; not a light gleams from a cabin window as she dashes past;
all is silent save the plashing rain, which, though the wind has abated,
continues to fall in torrents. Crossing the bleak moor, whose yawning pits
even in daylight suggest care and watchfulness, she gains the foot of the
barren mountain on which Barnagheela stands, and descries in the distance
the flickering of a light dimly traceable through the falling rain.
</p>
<p>
For the first time her horse shows signs of fatigue, and Mary caresses him
with her hand, and speaks encouragingly to him as she slackens her pace,
ascending the hill at a slow walk. After about half an hour of this
toilsome progress, for the surface is stony and rock-covered, she reaches
the little &ldquo;boreen&rdquo; road which forms the approach to the house. Mary has
never been there before, and advances now slowly and carefully between two
rude walls of dry masonry which lead to the hall-door. As she nears the
house, the gleam of lights from between the ill-closed shutters attracts
her, and suddenly through the swooping rain come the sounds of several
voices in tones of riot and revelry. She listens; and it is now the rude
burst of applause that breaks forth,&mdash;a din of voices loudly
proclaiming the hearty approval of some sentiment or opinion.
</p>
<p>
While she halts to determine what course next to follow,&mdash;for these
signs of revelry have disconcerted her,&mdash;she hears a rough, loud
voice from within call out, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another toast you must drink now, and
fill for it to the brim. Come, Peter Hayes, no skulking; the liquor is
good, and the sentiment the same. Gentlemen, you came here to-night to
honor my poor house&mdash;my ancestral house, I may call it&mdash;on the
victory we &lsquo;ve gained over tyranny and oppression.&rdquo; Loud cheers here
interrupted him, but he resumed: &ldquo;They tried&mdash;by the aid of the law
that they made themselves&mdash;to turn me out of my house and home. They
did all that false swearing and forged writing could do, to drive me&mdash;me,
Tom Magennis, the last of an ancient stock&mdash;out upon the highways.&rdquo;
 (Groans from the hearers.) &ldquo;But they failed,&mdash;ay, gentlemen, they
failed. Old Repton, with all his skill, and Scanlan, with all his
treachery, could n&rsquo;t do it. Joe Nelligan, like Goliath&mdash;no, like
David, I mean&mdash;put a stone between their two eyes, and laid them
low.&rdquo; (Loud cheering, and cries of &ldquo;Why is n&rsquo;t he here?&rdquo; &ldquo;Where is he
to-night?&rdquo;) &ldquo;Ay, gentlemen,&rdquo; resumed the speaker, &ldquo;ye may well ask where
is he this night? when we are celebrating not only our triumph, but his;
for it was the first brief he ever held,&mdash;the first guinea he ever
touched for a fee! I &lsquo;ll tell you where he is. Skulking&mdash;ay, that&rsquo;s
the word for it&mdash;skulking in Oughterard,&mdash;hiding himself for
shame because he beat the Martins!&rdquo; ( Loud expressions of anger, and some
of dissent, here broke forth; some inveighing against this cowardice,
others defending him against the charge.) &ldquo;Say what you like,&rdquo; roared
Magennis; &ldquo;I know, and he knows that I know it. What was it he said when
Mahony went to him with my brief? &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not refuse to undertake the case,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;but I &lsquo;ll not lend myself to any scurrilous attack upon the
family at Cro&rsquo; Martin!&rsquo;&rdquo; (Groans.) &ldquo;Ay, but listen,&rdquo; continued he: &ldquo;&lsquo;And
if I find,&rsquo; said he&mdash;&lsquo;if I find that in the course of the case such
an attempt should be made, I &lsquo;ll throw down my brief though I never should
hold another.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s Joe Nelligan for you! There&rsquo;s the stuff you thought
you &lsquo;d make a Patriot out of!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Say what you like, Tom Magennis, he&rsquo;s a credit to the town,&rdquo; said old
Hayes, &ldquo;and he won your cause this day against one of the &lsquo;cutest of the
Dublin counsellors.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He did so, sir,&rdquo; resumed Magennis, &ldquo;and he got his pay, and there&rsquo;s
nothing between us; and I told him so, and more besides; for I said, &lsquo;You
may flatter them and crawl to them; you may be as servile as a serpent or
a boa-constrictor to them; but take <i>my</i> word for it, Mister Joe,&mdash;or
Counsellor Nelligan, if you like it better,&mdash;they&rsquo;ll never forget who
and what you are,&mdash;the son of old Dan there, of the High Street,&mdash;and
you &lsquo;ve a better chance to be the Chief Justice than the husband of Mary
Martin!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You told him that!&rdquo; cried several together. &ldquo;I did, sir; and I believe
for a minute he meant to strike me; he got pale with passion, and then he
got red&mdash;blood red; and, in that thick way he has when he &lsquo;s angry,
he said, &lsquo;Whatever may be my hopes of the Bench, I&rsquo;ll not win my way to it
by ever again undertaking the cause of a ruffian!&rsquo; &lsquo;Do you mean <i>me?</i>&rsquo;
said I,&mdash;&lsquo;do you mean <i>me?</i>&rsquo; But he turned away into the house,
and I never saw him since. If it had n&rsquo;t been for Father Neal there, I &lsquo;d
have had him out for it, sir!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve other work before us than quarrelling amongst ourselves,&rdquo; said the
bland voice of Father Rafferty; &ldquo;and now for your toast, Tom, for I &lsquo;m dry
waiting for it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here it is, then,&rdquo; cried Magennis. &ldquo;A speedy downfall to the Martins!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A speedy downfall to the Martins!&rdquo; was repeated solemnly in chorus; while
old Hayes interposed, &ldquo;Barring the niece,&mdash;barring Miss Mary.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t except one,&rdquo; cried Magennis. &ldquo;My august leader remarked, &lsquo;It was
false pity for individuals destroyed the great revolution of France.&rsquo; It
was&mdash;&rdquo; Mary did not wait for more, but, turning her horse&rsquo;s head,
moved slowly around towards the back of the house.
</p>
<p>
Through a wide space, of which the rickety broken gate hung by a single
hinge, Mary entered a large yard, a court littered with disabled carts,
harrows, and other field implements, all equally unserviceable. Beneath a
low shed along one of the walls stood three or four horses, with harness
on them, evidently belonging to the guests assembled within. All these
details were plainly visible by the glare of an immense fire which blazed
on the kitchen hearth, and threw its light more than half-way across the
yard. Having disposed of her horse at one end of the shed, Mary stealthily
drew nigh the kitchen window, and looked in. An old, very old woman, in
the meanest attire, sat crouching beside the fire; and although she held a
huge wooden ladle in her hand, seemed, by her drooped head and bent-down
attitude, either moping or asleep. Various cooking utensils were on the
fire, and two or three joints of meat hung roasting before it, while the
hearth was strewn with dishes, awaiting the savory fare that was to fill
them.
</p>
<p>
These, and many other indications of the festivity then going on within,
Mary rapidly noticed; but it was evident, from the increasing eagerness of
her gaze, that the object which she sought had not yet met her eye.
Suddenly, however, the door of the kitchen opened and a figure entered, on
which the young girl bent all her attention. It was Joan Landy, but how
different from the half-timid, half-reckless peasant girl that last we saw
her! Dressed in a heavy gown of white satin, looped up on either side with
wreaths of flowers, and wearing a rich lace cap on her head, she rushed
hurriedly in, her face deeply flushed, and her eyes sparkling with
excitement. Hastily snatching up a check apron that lay on a chair, she
fastened it about her, and drew near the fire. It was plain from her
gesture, as she took the ladle from the old woman&rsquo;s hand, that she was
angry, and by her manner seemed as if rebuking her. The old crone,
however, only crouched lower, and spreading out her wasted fingers towards
the blaze, appeared insensible to everything addressed to her. Meanwhile
Joan busied herself about the fire with all the zealous activity of one
accustomed to the task. Mary watched her intently; she scrutinized with
piercing keenness every lineament of that face, now moved by its passing
emotions, and she muttered to herself, &ldquo;Alas, I have come in vain!&rdquo; Nor
was this depressing sentiment less felt as Joan, turning from the fire,
approached a fragment of a broken looking-glass that stood against the
wall. Drawing herself up to her full height, she stood gazing proudly,
delightedly, at her own figure. The humble apron, too, was speedily
discarded, and as she trampled it beneath her feet she seemed to spurn the
mean condition of which it was the symbol. Mary Martin sighed deeply as
she looked, and muttered once more, &ldquo;In vain!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Then suddenly starting, with one of those bursts of energy which so often
had steeled her heart against peril, she walked to the kitchen-door,
raised the latch, and entered. She had made but one step within the door
when Joan turned and beheld her; and there they both stood, silently, each
surveying the other. Mary felt too intensely the difficulty of the task
before her to utter a word without well weighing the consequences. She
knew how the merest accident might frustrate all she had in view, and
stood hesitating and uncertain, when Joan, who now recognized her,
vacillated between her instinctive sense of respect and a feeling of
defiance in the consciousness of where she was. Happily for Mary the
former sentiment prevailed, and in a tone of kindly anxiety Joan drew near
her and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Has anything happened? I trust in God no accident has
befell you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thank God, nothing worse than a wetting,&rdquo; said Mary,&mdash;&ldquo;some little
fatigue; and I&rsquo;ll think but little of either if they have brought me here
to a good end. May I speak with you alone,&mdash;quite alone?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come in here,&rdquo; said Joan, pushing open the door of a small room off the
kitchen which served for a species of larder,&mdash;&ldquo;come in here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have come on a sad errand,&rdquo; said Mary, taking her hand between both her
own, &ldquo;and I would that it had fallen to any other than myself. It is for
you to decide that! have not come in vain.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What is it? tell me what it is?&rdquo; cried Joan, as a sudden paleness spread
over her features.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;These are days of sorrow and mourning everywhere,&rdquo; said Mary, gloomily.
&ldquo;Can you not guess what my tidings may be? No, no,&rdquo; cried she, as a sudden
gesture of Joan interrupted her,&mdash;&ldquo;no, not yet; he is still alive,
and entreats to see you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To curse me again, is it?&rdquo; cried the other, wildly; &ldquo;to turn me from the
door, and pray down curses on me,&mdash;is it for that he wants to see
me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not for that, indeed,&rdquo; said Mary; &ldquo;it is to see you&mdash;to give you his
last kiss&mdash;his last blessing&mdash;to forgive you and be forgiven.
Remember that he is alone, deserted by all that once were his. Your father
and mother and sisters are all gone to America, and poor old Mat lingers
on,&mdash;nay, the journey is nigh ended. Oh, do not delay, lest it be too
late. Come now&mdash;now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And if I see him once, can I ever come back to this?&rdquo; cried Joan, in
bitter agony. &ldquo;Will I ever be able to hear his words and live as I do
now?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0007" id="linkimage-0007">

</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/162.jpg" width="100%" alt="162 " />
</div>
<p>
&ldquo;Let your own good heart guide you for that,&rdquo; cried Mary; &ldquo;all I ask is
that you should see him and be with him. I have pledged myself for your
coming, and you will not dishonor my words to one on his death-bed.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I &lsquo;ll be an outcast for it. Tom will drive me from the door and never
see me again. I know it,&mdash;I know <i>him</i>!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are wrong, Joan Landy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Joan!&mdash;who dares to call me Joan Landy when I&rsquo;m Mrs. Magennis of
Barnagheela? and if <i>I&rsquo;m</i> not <i>your</i> equal, I &lsquo;m as good as any
other in the barony. Was it to insult me you came here to-night, to bring
up to me who I am and where I came from? That &lsquo;s the errand that brought
you through the storm! Ay,&rdquo; cried she, lashed to a wilder passion by her
own words,&mdash;&ldquo;ay! ay! and if you and yours had their will we &lsquo;d not
have the roof to shelter us this night. It &lsquo;s only to-day that we won the
trial against you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Whatever my errand here this night,&rdquo; said Mary, with a calm dignity, &ldquo;it
was meant to serve and not insult you. I know, as well as your bitterest
words can tell me, that this is not my place; but I know, too, if from
yielding to my selfish pride I had refused your old grandfather this last
request, it had been many a year of bitter reproach to me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you &lsquo;ll break my heart, you will, you will!&rdquo; cried Joan, bitterly.
&ldquo;You &lsquo;ll turn the only one that&rsquo;s left against me, and I &lsquo;ll be alone in
the world.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come with me this night, and whatever happen I &lsquo;ll befriend you,&rdquo; said
Mary.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And not desert me because I &lsquo;m what I am?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never, Joan, never!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my blessings on you,&mdash;if the blessing of one like me is any
good,&rdquo; cried she, kissing Mary&rsquo;s hand fervently. &ldquo;Oh, they that praised
you said the truth; you have goodness enough in your heart to make up for
us all! I &lsquo;ll go with you to the world&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pass Cro&rsquo; Martin, and you shall have my horse&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no, Miss Mary, I &lsquo;ll go on my feet; it best becomes me. I &lsquo;ll go by
Burnane&mdash;by the Gap&mdash;I know it well&mdash;too well!&rdquo; added she,
as the tears rushed to her eyes. As she was speaking, she took off the cap
she wore and threw it from her; and then removing her dress, put on the
coarse woollen gown of her daily wear. &ldquo;Oh, God forgive me!&rdquo; cried she,
&ldquo;if I curse the day that I ever wore better than this.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mary assisted her with her dress, fastening the hood of her cloak over her
head, and preparing her, as best she might, for the severe storm she was
to encounter; and it was plain to see that Joan accepted these little
services without a thought of by whom they were rendered, so intensely
occupied was her mind by the enterprise before her. A feverish haste to be
away marked all she did. It was partly terror lest her escape might be
prevented; partly a sense of distrust in herself, and that she might
abandon her own resolution.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, tell me,&rdquo; she cried, as the tears streamed from her eyes, and her
lips quivered with agony,&mdash;&ldquo;oh, tell me I&rsquo;m doing right; tell me that
God&rsquo;s blessing is going with me this night, or I can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And so it is, dear Joan,&rdquo; said Mary; &ldquo;be of good heart, and Heaven will
support you. I &lsquo;m sure the trial is a sore one.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, is it not to leave this&mdash;to leave him&mdash;maybe forever? To be
sure, it&rsquo;s forever,&rdquo; cried she, bitterly. &ldquo;He &lsquo;ll never forgive me!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A wild burst of revelry now resounded from the parlor, and the discordant
sounds of half-drunken voices burst upon their ears.
</p>
<p>
Joan started, and gazed wildly around her. The agonized look of her
features bespoke her dread of detection; and then with a bound she sprung
madly from the spot, and was away. Mary followed quickly; but before she
had secured her horse and mounted, the other was already half-way down the
mountain. Now catching, now losing sight of her again, Mary at last came
up with her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Remember, dear Joan,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;there are nine weary miles of mountain
before you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know it well,&rdquo; was the brief reply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And if you go by Burnane the rocks are slippy with the rain, and the path
to the shore is full of danger.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I was afeard of danger, would I be here?&rdquo; cried she. &ldquo;Oh, Miss Mary,&rdquo;
 added she, stopping and grasping her hand in both her own, &ldquo;leave me to
myself; don&rsquo;t come with me,&mdash;it&rsquo;s not one like you ought to keep me
company.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But Joan,&mdash;dear Joan,&mdash;I have promised to be your friend, and I
am not one who forgets a pledge.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My heart will break; it will break in two if you talk to me. Leave me,
for the love of Heaven, and let me go my road all alone. There, at the two
trees there, is the way to Cro&rsquo; Martin; take it, and may the Saints guide
you safe home!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And if I do, Joan, will you promise me to come straight back to Cro&rsquo;
Martin after you &lsquo;ve seen him? Will you do this?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will,&mdash;I will,&rdquo; cried she, bathing Mary&rsquo;s hand with her tears as
she kissed it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then God bless and protect you, poor girl!&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;It is not for me
to dictate to your own full heart. Goodbye,&mdash;good-bye.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Before Mary had dried the warm tears that rose to her eyes, Joan was gone.

<h2>
CHAPTER XIV. THE END OF A BAR MESS
</h2>
<p>
There are few things more puzzling to the uninitiated than the total
separation lawyers are able to exercise between their private sentiments
and the emotions they display in the wear and tear of their profession. So
widely apart are these two characters, that it is actually difficult to
understand how they ever can unite in one man. But so it is. He can pass
his morning in the most virulent assaults upon his learned brother,
ridiculing his law, laughing at his logic, arraigning his motives,&mdash;nay,
sometimes ascribing to him some actually base and wicked. Altercations,
heightened by all that passion stimulated by wit can produce, ensue.
Nothing that can taunt, provoke, or irritate, is omitted. Personalities
even are introduced to swell the acrimony of the contest; and yet, when
the jury have given in their verdict and the court breaks up, the
gladiators, who seemed only thirsting for each other&rsquo;s blood, are seen
laughingly going homeward arm-in-arm, mayhap discoursing over the very
cause which, but an hour back, seemed to have stamped them enemies for the
rest of life.
</p>
<p>
Doubtless there is a great deal to be pleased at in all this, and, we
ought to rejoice in the admirable temper by which men can discriminate
between the faithful performance of a duty and the natural course of their
affections. Still, small-minded folk&mdash;of which wide category we own
ourselves to be a part&mdash;may have their misgivings that the excellence
of this system is not without its alloy, and that even the least ingenious
of men will ultimately discover how much principle is sapped, and how much
truthfulness of character is sacrificed in this continual struggle between
fiction and reality.
</p>
<p>
The Bar is the nursery of the Senate, and it would not be a very fanciful
speculation were we to ascribe the laxity of purpose, the deficient
earnestness, and the insincerity of principle we often deplore in our
public men, to this same legal training.
</p>
<p>
The old lawyer, however, finds no difficulty in the double character. With
his wig and gown he puts on his sarcasm, his insolence, and his
incredulity. His brief bag opens to him a Pandora&rsquo;s box of noxious
influences; and as he passes the precincts of the court, he leaves behind
him all the amenities of life and all the charities of his nature. The
young barrister does not find the transmutation so easy. He gives himself
unreservedly to his client, and does not measure his ardor by the
instructions in his brief. Let us ask pardon of our reader for what may
seem <i>a mal à propos</i> digression; but we have been led to these
remarks by the interests of our story.
</p>
<p>
It was in the large dining-room of the &ldquo;Martin Arms&rdquo; at Oughterard, that a
party of lawyers spent the evening, some of whose events, elsewhere, our
last chapter has recorded. It was the Bar mess of the Western Circuit, and
the chair was filled by no less a person than &ldquo;Father Repton.&rdquo; This able
&ldquo;leader&rdquo; had determined not to visit the West of Ireland so long as his
friend Martin remained abroad; but a very urgent entreaty from Scanlan,
and a pressing request for his presence, had induced him to waive that
resolve, and come down special to Oughterard for the Magennis case.
</p>
<p>
A simple case of ejectment could scarcely have called for that imposing
array of learned counsel who had repaired to this unfrequented spot; so
small a skirmish could never have called for the horse, foot, and dragoons
of law,&mdash;the wily conveyancer, the clap-trap orator, the browbeater
of witnesses, and the light sharpshooter at technicalities; and yet there
they were all met, and&mdash;with all reverence be it spoken&mdash;very
jolly companions they were.
</p>
<p>
An admirable rule precluded the introduction of, or even an allusion to,
professional subjects, save when the burden of a joke, whose success might
excuse the transgression; and thus these crafty, keen intelligences
argued, disputed, jested, and disported together, in a vein which less
practised talkers would find it hard to rival. To the practice of these
social amenities is doubtless ascribable the absence of any rancor from
the rough contests and collisions of public life, and thus men of every
shade of politics and party, differing even in class and condition, formed
admirable social elements, and cohered together to perfection.
</p>
<p>
As the evening wore on, the company insensibly thinned off. Some of the
hard-workers retired early; a few, whose affectation it was to pretend
engagements, followed. The &ldquo;juniors&rdquo; repaired in different groups to the
chambers of their friends, where loo and brandy-and-water awaited them;
and at last Repton was left, with only two others, sole occupants of that
spacious apartment. His companions were, like himself, soldiers of the
&ldquo;Vieille Garde&rdquo; veterans who remembered Curran and Lawrence Parsons, John
Toler and Saurin, and a host of others, who only needed that the sphere
should have been greater to be themselves among the great of the nation.
</p>
<p>
Rawlins was Repton&rsquo;s schoolfellow, and had been his rival at the Bar for
nigh fifty years. Niel, a few years younger than either, was the greatest
orator of his time. Both had been opposed to Repton in the present suit,
and had held heavy retainers for their services.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, Repton,&rdquo; said Rawlins, as soon as they were left thus to
themselves, &ldquo;are you pondering over it still? I see that you can&rsquo;t get it
out of your head.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is quite true, I cannot,&rdquo; said Repton. &ldquo;To summon us all down here,&mdash;to
bring us some fifty miles away from our accustomed beat, for a trumpery
affair like this, is totally beyond me. Had it been an election time, I
should probably have understood it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; cried Niel, in the shrill piercing voice peculiar to him, and
which imparted to him, even in society, an air of querulous irritability.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;On the principle that Bob Mahon always puts a thoroughbred horse in his
gig when he drives over to a country race. He&rsquo;s always ready for a match
with what he jocularly calls &lsquo;the old screw I &lsquo;m driving this minute;&rsquo; so,
Niel, I thought that the retainer for the ejectment might have turned out
to be a special fee for the election.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And he &lsquo;d have given them a speech, and a rare good one, too, I promise
you,&rdquo; said Rawlins; &ldquo;and even if he had not time to speak it, the county
paper would have had it all printed and corrected from his own hand, with
all the appropriate interruption of &lsquo;vociferous cheering,&rsquo; and the places
where the orator was obliged to pause, from the wild tumult of acclamation
that surrounded him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Which all resolves itself into this,&rdquo; screamed Niel,&mdash;&ldquo;that some
men&rsquo;s after-grass is better than other men&rsquo;s meadows.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mine has fallen to the scythe many a day ago,&rdquo; said Rawlins, plaintively;
&ldquo;but I remember glorious times and glorious fellows. It was, indeed, worth
something to say, &lsquo;<i>Vixissi cum illis</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There &lsquo;s another still better, Rawlins,&rdquo; cried Repton, joyously, &ldquo;which
is to have survived them!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; cried Niel. &ldquo;I &lsquo;d always plead a demurrer to any notice to
quit; for, take it all in all, this life has many enjoyments.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Such as Attorney-Generalships, Masters of the Rolls, and such like,&rdquo; said
Repton.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Rawlins, &ldquo;who put that squib in the papers about your
having refused the rolls,&mdash;eh, Niel?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who but Niel himself?&rdquo; chimed in Repton. &ldquo;It was filing a bill of
discovery. He wanted to know the intentions of the Government.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I could have had but little doubt of them,&rdquo; broke in Niel. &ldquo;It was my
advice, man, cancelled your appointment as Crown Counsel, Repton. I told
Massingbred, &lsquo;If you do keep a watch-dog, let it be, at least, one who &lsquo;ll
bite some one beside the family.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He has muzzled you there, Repton,&rdquo; said Rawlins, laughing. &ldquo;Eh, that was
a bitter draught!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So it was,&rdquo; said Repton. &ldquo;It was Curran wine run to the lees! and very
unlike the racy flavor of the true liquor. And to speak in all
seriousness, what has come over us all to be thus degenerate and fallen?
It is not alone that we have not the equals of the first-rate men, but we
really have nothing to compare with O&rsquo;Grady, and Parsons, and a score of
others.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;ll tell you why,&rdquo; cried Niel,&mdash;&ldquo;the commodity is n&rsquo;t marketable.
The stupid men, who will always be the majority everywhere, have got up
the cry, that to be agreeable is to be vulgar. We know how large cravats
came into fashion; tiresome people came in with high neckcloths.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish they &lsquo;d go out with hempen ones, then,&rdquo; muttered Repton.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;d not refuse them the benefit of the clergy,&rdquo; said Niel, with a
malicious twinkle of the eye, that showed how gladly, when occasion
offered, he flung a pebble at the Church.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They were very brilliant,&mdash;they were very splendid, I own,&rdquo; said
Rawlins; &ldquo;but I have certain misgivings that they gave themselves too much
to society.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Expended too much of their powder in fireworks,&rdquo; cried Niel, sharply,&mdash;&ldquo;so
they did; but their rockets showed how high they could rise to.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, Niel, and we only burn our fingers with ours,&rdquo; said Repton,
sarcastically.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Depend upon it,&rdquo; resumed Rawlins, &ldquo;as the world grows more practical, you
will have less of great convivial display. Agreeability will cease to be
the prerogative of first-rate men, but be left to the smart people of
society, who earn their soup by their sayings.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; cried Niel, in his shrillest tone. &ldquo;The age of alchemists is
gone; the sleight-of-hand man and the juggler have succeeded him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And were they not alchemists?&rdquo; exclaimed old Repton, enthusiastically.
&ldquo;Did they not transmute the veriest dross of the earth, and pour it forth
from the crucible of their minds a stream of liquid gold?&mdash;glorious
fellows, who, in the rich abundance of their minds, brought the learning
of their early days to illustrate the wisdom of their age, and gave the
fresh-heartedness of the schoolboy to the ripe intelligence of manhood.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet how little have they bequeathed to us!&rdquo; said Niel.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Would it were even less,&rdquo; broke in Repton. &ldquo;We read the witticism of
brilliant conversera in some diary or journal, often ill recorded,
imperfectly given, always unaccompanied by the accessories of the scene
wherein they occurred. We have not the crash, the tumult, the headlong
flow of social intercourse, where the impromptu fell like a thunderbolt,
and the bon mots rattled like a fire of musketry. To attempt to convey an
impression of these great talkers by a memoir, is like to picture a battle
by reading out a list of the killed and wounded.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Repton is right!&rdquo; exclaimed Niel. &ldquo;The recorded bon mot is the words of a
song without the music.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And often where it was the melody that inspired the verses,&rdquo; added
Repton, always glad to follow up an illustration.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Rawlins, &ldquo;the fashion of the day is changed in other
respects as well as in conversational excellence. Nothing is like what we
remember it!&mdash;literature, dress, social habits, oratory. There, for
instance, was that young fellow to-day; his speech to the jury,&mdash;a
very good and sensible one, no doubt,&mdash;but how unlike what it would
have been some five-and-thirty or forty years ago.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was first-rate,&rdquo; said Repton, with enthusiasm. &ldquo;I say it frankly, and
‘fas est ab hoste,&rsquo; for he tripped me up in a point of law, and I have,
therefore, a right to applaud him. To tell you the truth,&rdquo; he added slyly,
&ldquo;I knew I was making a revoke, but I thought none of the players were
shrewd enough to detect me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Niel and I are doubtless much complimented by the remark,&rdquo; said Rawlins.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pooh, pooh!&rdquo; cried Repton, &ldquo;what did great guns like you and Niel care
for such &lsquo;small deer.&rsquo; You were only brought down here as a great <i>corps
de réserve</i>. It was young Nelligan who fought the battle, and admirably
he did it. While I was listening to him to-day, I could not help saying to
myself, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s well for us that there were no fellows of this stamp in our
day.&rsquo; Ay, Rawlins, you know it well. We were speech-makers; these fellows
are lawyers.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he dine with us to-day?&rdquo; asked Niel, sharply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Heaven knows. I believe his father lives in the town here; perhaps, too,
he had no fancy for a dress-parade before such drill-sergeants as you and
Rawlins there.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are acquainted with him, I think?&rdquo; asked Rawlins.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, slightly; we met strangely enough, at Cro&rsquo; Martin last year. He was
then on a visit there, a quiet, timid youth, who actually seemed to feel
as though his college successes were embarrassing recollections in a
society who knew nothing of deans or proctors. There was another young
fellow also there at the time,&mdash;young Massingbred,&mdash;with about a
tenth of this man&rsquo;s knowledge, and a fiftieth of his capacity, who took
the lead of him on every subject, and by the bare force of an admirable
manner and a most unabashed impudence, threw poor Nelligan completely into
the background. It was the same kind of thing I &lsquo;ve often seen Niel there
perform at the Four Courts, where he has actually picked up his law from a
worsted opponent, as a highwayman arms himself with the pistols of the man
he has robbed.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I never pillaged <i>you</i>, Repton,&rdquo; said Niel, with a sarcastic smile.
&ldquo;<i>You</i> had always the privilege the poet ascribes to him who laughs
‘before a robber.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Vacuus sed non Inanis,&rdquo; replied Repton, laughing good-humoredly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But tell us more of this man, Nelligan,&rdquo; said Rawlins. &ldquo;I &lsquo;m curious to
hear about him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And so you are sure to do some of these days, Rawlins. That fellow is the
man to attain high eminence.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;His religion will stop him!&rdquo; cried Niel, sharply; for, being himself a
Romanist, he was not sorry to have an opportunity of alluding to the
disqualifying element.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Say, rather, it will promote him,&rdquo; chimed in Repton. &ldquo;Take my word for
it, Niel, there is a spirit of mawkish reparation abroad which affects to
feel that all your coreligionists have a long arrear due to them, and that
all the places and emoluments so long withheld from their ancestors should
be showered down upon the present generation;&mdash;pretty much upon the
same principle that you &lsquo;d pension a man now because his grandfather had
been hanged for rebellion!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And very justly, too, if you discovered that what you once called
rebellion had been very good loyalty!&rdquo; cried Niel.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We have not, however, made the discovery you speak of,&rdquo; said Rep ton; &ldquo;we
have only commuted a sentence, in the sincere hope that you are wiser than
your forefathers. But to come back. You may trust me when I say that a day
is coming when you &lsquo;ll not only bless yourself because you&rsquo;re a Papist,
but that you <i>are</i> one! Ay, sir, it is in &lsquo;Liffey Street Chapel&rsquo; we
‘ll seek for an attorney-general, and out of the Church of the Conception,
if that be the name of it, we &lsquo;ll cull our law advisers of the Crown. For
the next five-and-twenty years, at least,&rdquo; said he, solemnly, &ldquo;the
fourth-rate Catholic will be preferred to the first-rate Protestant.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I only hope you may be better at Prophecy than you are in Logic,&rdquo; cried
Niel, as he tossed off his glass; &ldquo;and so, I &lsquo;m sure, does Nelligan!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And Nelligan is exactly the man who will never need the preference, sir.
His abilities will raise him, even if there were obstacles to be
surmounted. It is men of a different stamp that the system will favor,&mdash;fellows
without industry for the toils of a laborious profession, or talents for
the subtleties of a difficult career; men who cherish ambition and are yet
devoid of capacity, and will plead the old disabilities of their faith,&mdash;pretty
much as a man might claim his right to be thought a good dancer because
his father had a club foot.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A most lame conclusion!&rdquo; cried Niel. &ldquo;Ah, Rawlins,&rdquo; added he, with much
compassion, &ldquo;our poor friend here is breaking terribly. Sad signs there
are of decay about him. Even his utterance begins to fail him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Repton, gayly. &ldquo;I know what you allude to. It is an old
imperfection of mine not to be able to enunciate the letter <i>r</i>
correctly, and that was the reason today in court that I called you my
ingenious Bother; but I meant Brother, I assure you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
They all laughed good-humoredly at the old man&rsquo;s sally; in good truth, so
trained were they to these sort of combats, that they cared little for the
wounds such warfare inflicted. And although the tilt was ever understood
as with &ldquo;reversed lances,&rdquo; none ever cherished an evil memory if an
unlucky stroke smote too heavily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have asked young Nelligan to breakfast with me tomorrow,&rdquo; said Repton;
&ldquo;will you both come and meet him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We &lsquo;re off at cock-crow!&rdquo; cried Kiel. &ldquo;Tell him, however, from me that I
am delighted with his <i>débuts</i> and that all the best wishes of my
friends and myself are with him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And so they parted.
</p>
<p>
Repton, however, did not retire to bed at once; his mind was still intent
upon the subject which had engaged him during the day, and as he walked to
and fro in his room, he still dwelt upon it. Scanlan&rsquo;s instructions had
led him to believe that the Martins were in this case to have been &ldquo;put
upon their title;&rdquo; and the formidable array of counsel employed by
Magennis seemed to favor the impression. Now it was true that a trifling
informality in the service of the writ had quashed the proceedings for the
present; but the question remained, &ldquo;Was the great struggle only reserved
for a future day?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was clear that a man embarrassed as was Magennis could never have
retained that strong bar of eminent lawyers. From what fund, then, came
these resources? Was there a combination at work? And if so, to what end,
and with what object?
</p>
<p>
The crafty old lawyer pondered long and patiently over these things. His
feelings might not inaptly be compared to those of a commandant of a
garrison, who sees his stronghold menaced by an enemy he had never
suspected. Confident as he is in the resources of his position, he yet
cannot resist the impression that the very threat of attack has been
prompted by some weakness of which he is unaware.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To put us on our title,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;implies a great war. Let us try and
find out who and what are they who presume to declare it!&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER XV. A FIRST BRIEF
</h2>
<p>
The reader has been already told that Joe Nelligan had achieved a great
success in his first case. A disputed point of law had been raised, in
itself insignificant, but involving in its train a vast variety of
momentous interests. Repton, with an ingenuity all his own, had contrived
to draw the discussion beyond its original limits, that he might entangle
and embarrass the ambitious junior who had dared to confute him. Nelligan
accepted the challenge at once, and after a stormy discussion of some
hours came out the victor. For a while his timid manner, and an
overpowering sense of the great odds against him, seemed to weigh
oppressively on him. The very successes he had won elsewhere were really
so many disparagements to him now, giving promise, as it were, of his
ability. But, despite all these disadvantages, he entered the lists
manfully and courageously.
</p>
<p>
What a many-sided virtue is this same courage, and how prone is the world
to award its praises unequally for it! We are enthusiastic for the gallant
soldier the earliest in the breach, or the glorious sailor who first jumps
upon the enemy&rsquo;s quarter-deck, and yet we never dream of investing with
heroism him who dares to combat with the most powerful intellects of
debate, or enters the field of argument against minds stored with vast
resources of knowledge, and practised in all the subtleties of
disputation.
</p>
<p>
It is time, existence is not in the issue; but are there not things a
thousand times dearer than life at peril? Think of him who has gone on
from success to success; whose school triumphs have but heralded the riper
glories of college life; who, rising with each new victory, is hailed by
that dearest and best of all testimonies,&mdash;the prideful enthusiasm of
his own age. Fancy him, the victor in every struggle, who has carried all
before him,&mdash;the vaunted chief of his contemporaries,&mdash;fancy him
beaten and worsted on his first real field of action. Imagine such a man,
with all the prestige of his college fame, rudely encountered and overcome
in the contest of public life, and say if any death ever equalled the
suffering!
</p>
<p>
Happily, our task has not to record any such failure in the present case.
Young Nelligan sat down amidst the buzzing sound of approving voices, and
received a warm eulogy from the Court on the promise of so conspicuous an
opening. And a proud man was Dan Nelligan on that day! At any other time
how deeply honored had he felt by the distinguished notice of the great
dignitaries who now congratulated him on his son&rsquo;s success! With what
pride had he accepted the polite recognition of Chief Barons and
silk-gowned &ldquo;leaders&rdquo;! Now, however, his heart had but room for one
thought,&mdash;Joe himself,&mdash;his own boy,&mdash;the little child as
it were of yesterday, now a man of mark and note, already stamped with the
impress of success in what, to every Irishman&rsquo;s heart at least, is the
first of all professions. The High Sheriff shook old Nelligan&rsquo;s hand in
open court, and said, &ldquo;It is an honor to our county, Nelligan, to claim
him.&rdquo; The Judge sent a message that he wished to see him in his
robing-room, and spoke his warm praises of the &ldquo;admirable speech, as
remarkable for its legal soundness as for its eloquence;&rdquo; and Repton
overtook him in the street, and, catching his hand, said, &ldquo;Be proud of
him, sir, for we are all proud of him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mayhap the hope is not a too ambitious one, that some one of those who may
glance over these humble lines may himself have once stood in the position
of Joe Nelligan, in so far as regards the hour of his triumph, and have
felt in his heart the ecstasy of covering with his fame the &ldquo;dear head&rdquo; of
a father.
</p>
<p>
If so, I ask him boldly,&mdash;whatever may have been the high rewards of
his later fire, whatever honors may have been showered upon him, however
great his career, and however brilliant its recognitions,&mdash;has he
ever, in his proudest moments, tasted such a glorious thrill of delight as
when he has fallen into his father&rsquo;s arms overcome by the happiness that
he has made that father proud of him? Oh, ye who have experienced this
thrill of joy within you, cherish and preserve it. The most glowing
eulogies of eloquence, the most ornate paragraphs of a flattering press,
are sorry things in comparison to it. For ourselves, we had rather have
been Joe Nelligan when, with his father&rsquo;s warm tears dimming his eyes, he
said, &ldquo;God bless you, my boy!&rdquo; than have gained all the honors that even
talents like his can command!
</p>
<p>
He could not bear to absent himself from home that day; and although his
father would gladly have celebrated his triumph by gathering his friends
about him, Joe entreated that they might be alone. And they were so. The
great excitement of the day over, a sense of weariness, almost sadness,
stole over the young man; and while his father continued to relate for his
mother&rsquo;s hearing various little incidents of the trial, he listened with a
half-apathetic dreaminess, as though the theme oppressed him. The old man
dwelt with delight on the flattering attention bestowed by the Court on
Joseph&rsquo;s address, the signs of concurrence vouchsafed from time to time by
the Bench, the approving murmur of the Bar while he spoke, and then the
honest outburst of enthusiasm that shook the very walls as he concluded.
&ldquo;I tried,&rdquo; continued Dan Nelligan,&mdash;&ldquo;I tried to force my way through
the crowd, and come and tell you that he had gained the day, but I
couldn&rsquo;t; they were all around me, shaking my hands, patting me on the
shoulders, and saying, as if I did n&rsquo;t know it in my own heart, &lsquo;He &lsquo;ll
make you a proud man yet, Mr. Nelligan.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I heard it all, five minutes after it was over,&rdquo; said Mrs. Nelligan; &ldquo;and
you &lsquo;d never guess who told me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Counsellor Walsh,&rdquo; cried Nelligan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, indeed; I never seen him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was Hosey Lynch, then, for I saw him running like mad through the
town, spreading the news everywhere.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was not Hosey,&rdquo; said she, half contemptuously. &ldquo;I wish, Joe, you&rsquo;d
give a guess yourself who told me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Guess, mother,&mdash;guess who told you what?&rdquo; said he, suddenly starting
from some deep meditation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who told me that you won the cause, and beat all the great counsellors
from Dublin.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, mother, it would be hard for me to say,&rdquo; said Joseph, smiling
faintly; &ldquo;some of our kind townsfolk, perhaps. Father Neal, old Peter
Hayes, or&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just tell you at once,&rdquo; broke she in, half irritated at the
suggested source of her information. &ldquo;It was Miss Mary herself, and no
other.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Miss Martin!&rdquo; exclaimed old Nelligan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Miss Mary Martin!&rdquo; echoed Joe; while a sickly paleness crept over his
features, and his lips trembled as he spoke.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How came you to see her? Where was she?&rdquo; asked Nelligan, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; replied she, with all the methodical preparation by
which she heralded in the least important communications,&mdash;&ldquo;I &lsquo;ll
tell you. I was sitting here, working at the window, and wondering when
the trial would be over, for the goose that was for dinner was too near
the fire, and I said to myself&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never mind what you said to yourself,&mdash;confound the goose,&rdquo; broke in
old Dan, fiercely.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faith, then, I &lsquo;d like to know if you &lsquo;d be pleased to eat your dinner on
the cold loin of veal&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But Miss Martin, mother,&mdash;Miss Martin,&rdquo; urged Joe, impatiently.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to her, if you&rsquo;ll let me; but when you flurry me and frighten
me, I &lsquo;m ready to faint. It was last Candlemas you gave me a start, Dan,
about&mdash;what was it, now? Lucky Mason&rsquo;s dog, I believe. No, it was the
chimney took fire&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will you just go back to Miss Martin, if you please,&rdquo; said old Nelligan,
sternly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish I knew where I was,&mdash;what I was saying last,&rdquo; said she, in a
tone of deep sorrow and contrition.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You were going to say how Miss Mary told you all about the trial,
mother,&rdquo; said Joe, taking her hand kindly within his own.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, darling; now I remember it all. I was sitting here at the window
hemming them handkerchiefs of yours, and I heard a sharp sound of a horse
coming along quick, and, by the way he cantered, I said to myself, &lsquo;I know
<i>you</i>,&rsquo; and, sure enough, when I opened the window, there she was,
Miss Mary herself, all dripping with wet, and her hat flattened on her
face, at the door.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me to get down, Mrs. Nelligan,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;for I&rsquo;m in a great
hurry. I have to ride out to Kilkieran with this&rsquo;&mdash;and she showed me
a bottle she had in the pocket of her saddle. &lsquo;I only called to tell you
that your son has gained another&mdash;&rsquo; What was it she called it?&mdash;a
victory, or a battle,&mdash;no, it was something else&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never mind&mdash;go on,&rdquo; cried Joe; &ldquo;and then?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;But, my dear Miss Mary,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;you &lsquo;re wet through and through. It&rsquo;s
more than your life&rsquo;s worth to go off now another ten miles. I&rsquo;ll send our
gossoon, Mickey Slater, with the medicine, if you &lsquo;ll just come in and
stay with us.&rsquo; I did n&rsquo;t say to dinner, for I was ashamed to ask her to
that.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I should be delighted, Mrs. Nelligan,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;but it is impossible
to-day. I &lsquo;d have stayed and asked you for my dinner,&rsquo;&mdash;her very
words,&mdash;&lsquo;asked you for my dinner, but I have promised poor Mat Landy
to go back to him. But perhaps it is as well as it is; and my aunt Dorothy
might say, if she heard of it, that it was a strange choice I had made of
a festive occasion,&mdash;the day on which we were beaten, and the society
of him that worsted us.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, but, Miss Mary,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;sure you don&rsquo;t think the worse of poor Joe&mdash;&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I never thought more highly of him, my dear Mrs. Nelligan,&rsquo; said she,
‘than at this moment; and, whatever others may say or think, I&rsquo;ll maintain
my opinion, that he is a credit to us all. Good-bye! good-bye!&rsquo; and then
she turned short round, and said, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t answer for how my uncle may
feel about what has occurred to-day, but you know <i>my</i> sentiments.
Farewell!&rsquo; And with that she was off; indeed, before I had time to shut
down the window, she was out of sight and away.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She ought to know, and she will know, that Joe never said one hard thing
of her family. And though he had in his brief enough to tempt him to bring
the Martins up for judgment, not a word, not a syllable did he utter.&rdquo;
 This old Nelligan spoke with a proud consciousness of his son&rsquo;s honorable
conduct.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, &ldquo;is it not enough that a man sells his
intellect, pawns his capacity, and makes traffic of his brains, without
being called on to market his very nature, and set up his very emotions
for sale? If my calling demands this at my hands, I have done with it,&mdash;I
renounce it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I said you refrained, Joe. I remarked that you would not suffer the
heat of discussion to draw you into an angry attack&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you praise me for it!&rdquo; broke in Joe, passionately. &ldquo;You deem it an
occasion to compliment me, that, in defending the cause of a worthless
debauchee, I did not seize with avidity the happy moment to assail an
honorable gentleman; and not alone you, but a dozen others, congratulated
me on this reserve,&mdash;this constraint,&mdash;as though the lawyer were
but a bravo, and, his stiletto once paid for, he must produce the body of
his victim. I regard my profession in another and a higher light; but if
even its practice were the noblest that could engage human faculties, and
its rewards the highest that could crown them, I&rsquo;d quit it tomorrow, were
its price to be the sacrifice of an honorable self-esteem and the regard
of&mdash;of those we care for.&rdquo; And in the difficult utterance of the last
words his cheek became crimson, and his lip trembled.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;ll tell you what you &lsquo;ll do, Joe,&rdquo; said his mother, whose kindness was
not invariably distinguished by tact,&mdash;&ldquo;just come over with <i>me</i>
to-morrow to Cro&rsquo; Martin. I &lsquo;m going to get slips of the oak-leaf geranium
and the dwarf rose, and we &lsquo;ll just go together in a friendly way, and
when we &lsquo;re there you &lsquo;ll have some opportunity or other to tell Miss Mary
that it wasn&rsquo;t your fault for being against them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He &lsquo;ll do no such thing,&rdquo; broke in Nelligan, fiercely. &ldquo;Miss Mary Martin
wants no apologies,&mdash;her family have no right to any. Joe is a member
of a high and powerful profession. If he does n&rsquo;t fill as great a place
now, who knows where he &lsquo;ll not be this day fifteen years, eh, my boy?
Maybe I &lsquo;ll not be here to see,&mdash;indeed, it&rsquo;s more than likely I &lsquo;ll
not,&mdash;but I know it now. I feel as sure of it as I do that my name &lsquo;s
Dan.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And if you are not to see it, father,&rdquo; said Joe, as he pressed his
father&rsquo;s hand between both his own,&mdash;&ldquo;you and my dearest mother,&mdash;the
prize will be nigh valueless. If I cannot, when my reward is won, come
home,&mdash;to such a home as this,&mdash;the victory will be too late.&rdquo;
 And so saying he rose abruptly, and hurried from the room. The moment
after he had locked his door, and, flinging himself upon his bed, buried
his face between his hands.
</p>
<p>
With all the proud sensations of having achieved a great success, his
heart was heavily oppressed. It seemed to him as though Destiny had
decreed that his duty should ever place him in antagonism to his
affections. Up to a short period before this trial came on he had
frequently been in Miss Martin&rsquo;s company. Now, it was some trifling
message for his mother; now, some book he had himself promised to fetch
her; then visits to the sick&mdash;and Joe, latterly, had taken a most
benevolent turn&mdash;had constantly brought them together; and often,
when Mary was on foot, Joe had accompanied her to the gates of the
demesne. In these meetings one subject usually occupied them,&mdash;the
sad condition of the country, the destitution of the poor,&mdash;and on
this theme their sympathies and hopes and fears all agreed. It was not
only that they concurred in their views of the national character, but
that they attributed its traits of good or evil to the very same causes;
and while Nelligan was amazed at finding the daughter of a proud house
deeply conversant with the daily life of the humblest peasant, she, too,
was astonished how sincere in his respect for rank, how loyal in his
devotion to the claims of blood, was one whose birth might have proclaimed
him a democrat and a destroyer.
</p>
<p>
These daily discussions led them closer and closer to each other, till at
length confidences grew up between them, and Mary owned to many of the
difficulties that her lone and solitary station exposed her to. Many
things were done on the property without&mdash;some in direct opposition
to&mdash;her concurrence. As she once said herself, &ldquo;We are so ready to
satisfy our consciences by assuming that whatever we may do legally we
have a right to do morally, and at the same time, in the actual condition
of Ireland, what is just may be practically the very heaviest of all
hardships.&rdquo; This observation was made with reference to some law
proceedings of Scanlan&rsquo;s instituting, and the day after she chanced to
make it Joe started for Dublin. It was there that Magennis&rsquo;s attorney had
sent him the brief in that cause,&mdash;a charge which the etiquette of
his profession precluded his declining.
</p>
<p>
In what way he discharged the trust we have seen,&mdash;what sorrow it
cost him is more than we can describe. &ldquo;Miss Martin,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;would
know nothing of the rules which prescribe our practice, and will look upon
my conduct here as a treason. For weeks long she has conversed with me in
candor over the state of the county and its people; we separate for a few
days, and she finds me arrayed with others against the interests of her
family, and actually paid to employ against her the very knowledge she has
imparted to me! What a career have I chosen,&rdquo; cried he, in his agony, &ldquo;if
every success is to be purchased at such a price!&rdquo; With such men as
Magennis he had nothing in common; their society, their habits, their
opinions were all distasteful to him, and yet it was for him and his he
was to sacrifice the dearest hope of his heart,&mdash;to lose the good
esteem of one whose praise he had accounted more costly than the highest
distinction a sovereign could bestow on him. &ldquo;And what a false position
mine!&rdquo; cried he again. &ldquo;Associated by the very closest ties with a party
not one of whose objects have my sympathies, I see myself separated by
blood, birth, and station from all that I venerate and respect. I must
either be a traitor to my own or to myself; declare my enmity to all I
think most highly of, or suffer my motives to be impugned and my fame
tarnished.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There was, indeed, one circumstance in this transaction which displeased
him greatly, and of which he was only aware when too late. The Magennis
defence had been &ldquo;got up&rdquo; by a subscription,&mdash;a fund to which
Joseph&rsquo;s own father had contributed. Amongst the machinery of attack upon
the landed gentry, Father Neal Rafferty had suggested the expediency of
&ldquo;putting them on their titles&rdquo; in cases the most trivial and
insignificant. Forfeiture and confiscation had followed each other so
frequently in Irish history,&mdash;grants and revocations were so mixed up
together,&mdash;some attested in all formality, others irregular and
imperfect,&mdash;that it was currently believed there was scarcely one
single estate of the whole province could establish a clear and
indisputable title. The project was, therefore, a bold one which, while
disturbing the rights of property, should also bring under discussion so
many vexed questions of English rule and tyranny over the Irish. Libraries
and cabinets were ransacked for ancient maps of the counties; and old
records were consulted to ascertain how far the original conditions of
service, and so forth, had been complied with on which these estates were
held.
</p>
<p>
Joseph had frequently carried home books from the library of Cro&rsquo; Martin,
rare and curious volumes, which bore upon the ancient history of the
country. And now there crossed him the horrible suspicion that the whole
scheme of this attack might be laid to his charge, the information to
substantiate which he had thus surreptitiously-obtained. It was clear
enough, from what his mother had said, that such was not Miss Martin&rsquo;s
present impression; but who could say what representations might be made
to her, and what change effected in her sentiments? &ldquo;And this,&rdquo; cried he,
in indignation&mdash;&ldquo;and this is the great career I used to long for!&mdash;this
the broad highway I once fancied was to lead me to honor and distinction!
Or is it, after all, my own fault, for endeavoring to reconcile two-things
which never can have any agreement,&mdash;an humble origin and high
aspirings? Were I an Englishman, the difficulty would not be impassable;
but here, in Ireland, the brand of a lowly fortune and a despised race is
upon me. Can I&mdash;dare I resist it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A long and arduous conflict was that in which he passed the night,&mdash;now
inclining to abandon his profession forever, now to leave Ireland and join
the English or some Colonial Bar; and at length, as day was breaking, and
as though the fresh morning air which now blew upon him from his open
window had given fresh energy to his nature, he determined he would
persist in his career in his own country. &ldquo;<i>My</i> fate shall be an
example or a warning!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;They who come after me shall know
whether there be rewards within reach of honest toil and steady industry
without the contamination of a mock patriotism! If I <i>do</i> rise, it
shall be from no aid derived from a party or a faction; and if I fail, I
bring no discredit upon &lsquo;my order.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There are men who can so discipline their minds that they have but to
establish a law to their actions to make their whole lives &ldquo;a system.&rdquo;
 Such individuals the Germans not inaptly call &ldquo;self-contained men,&rdquo; and of
these was Joe Nelligan one.
</p>
<p>
A certain concentration of his faculties, and the fatigues of a whole
night passed thus in thought, gave a careworn, exhausted look to his
features as he entered the room where Repton sat awaiting him for
breakfast.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I see what&rsquo;s the matter with you,&rdquo; said the old lawyer, as he entered.
&ldquo;You have passed the night after a &lsquo;first brief.&rsquo; This day ten years
you&rsquo;ll speak five hours before the Lords &lsquo;in error,&rsquo; and never lose a wink
of sleep after it&rsquo;s over!&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER XVI. MR. REPTON LOOKS IN
</h2>
<p>
On the day after that some of whose events we have just recorded, and
towards nightfall, Mary Martin slowly drove along the darkly wooded avenue
of Cro&rsquo; Martin. An unusual sadness overweighed her. She was just returning
from the funeral of poor old Mat Landy, one of her oldest favorites as a
child. He it was who first taught her to hold an oar; and, seated beside
him, she first learned to steer a &ldquo;corragh&rdquo; through the wild waves of the
Atlantic. His honest, simple nature, his fine manly contentedness with a
very humble lot, and a cheerful gayety of heart that seemed never to
desert him, were all traits likely to impress such a child as she had been
and make his companionship a pleasure. With a heavy heart was it,
therefore, now that she thought over these things, muttering to herself as
she went along snatches of the old songs he used to sing, and repeating
mournfully the little simple proverbs he would utter about the weather.
</p>
<p>
The last scene itself had been singularly mournful. Two fishermen of the
coast alone accompanied the car which bore the coffin; death or sickness
was in every house; few could be spared to minister to the dead, and even
of those, the pale shrunk features and tottering limbs bespoke how dearly
the duty cost them. Old Mat had chosen for his last resting-place a little
churchyard that crowned a cliff over the sea,&mdash;a wild, solitary spot,&mdash;an
old gable, a ruined wall, a few low gravestones, and no more. The cliff
itself, rising abruptly from the sea to some four hundred feet, was
perforated with the nests of sea-fowl, whose melancholy cries, as they
circled overhead, seemed to ring out a last requiem. There it was they now
laid him. Many a time from that bleak summit had he lighted a beacon fire
to ships in distress.
</p>
<p>
Often and often, from that same spot, had he gazed out over the sea, to
catch signs of those who needed succor, and now that bold heart was still
and that strong arm stiffened, and the rough, deep voice that used to
sound above the tempest, silent forever.

<p>

</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never mind, Patsey,&rdquo; said Mary, to one of the fishermen, who was
endeavoring with some stray fragments of a wreck to raise a little
monument over the spot, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look to that hereafter.&rdquo; And so saying, she
turned mournfully away to descend the cliff. A stranger, wrapped in a
large boat-cloak, had been standing for some time near the place; and as
Mary left it, he drew nigh and asked who she was.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who would she be?&rdquo; said the fisherman, gruffly, and evidently in no humor
to converse.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A wife, or a daughter, perhaps?&rdquo; asked the other again.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Neither one nor the other,&rdquo; replied the fisherman.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is Miss Mary, sir,&mdash;Miss Martin,&mdash;God bless her!&rdquo; broke in
the other; &ldquo;one that never deserts the poor, living or dead. Musha! but
she&rsquo;s what keeps despair out of many a heart!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And has she come all this way alone?&rdquo; asked he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What other way could she come, I wonder?&rdquo; said the man he had first
addressed. &ldquo;Did n&rsquo;t they leave her there by herself, just as if she was
n&rsquo;t belonging to them? They were kinder to old Henderson&rsquo;s daughter than
to their own flesh and blood.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hush, Jerry, hush!&mdash;she &lsquo;ll hear you,&rdquo; cried the other. And saluting
the stranger respectfully, he began to follow down the cliff.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are there strangers stopping at the inn?&rdquo; asked Mary, as she saw lights
gleaming from some of the windows as she passed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, miss, there&rsquo;s him that was up there at the churchyard&mdash;ye
didn&rsquo;t remark him, maybe&mdash;and one or two more.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I did not notice him,&rdquo; said Mary; and, wishing the men good-night, set
out homeward. So frequent were the halts she made at different cabins as
she drove along, so many times was she stopped to give a word of advice or
counsel, that it was already duskish as she reached Cro&rsquo; Martin, and found
herself once more near home. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re late with the post this evening,
Billy,&rdquo; said she, overtaking the little fellow who carried the mail from
Oughterard.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, miss, there was great work sortin&rsquo; the letters that came in this
morning, for I believe there&rsquo;s going to be another election; at least I
heard Hosey Lynch say it was all about that made the bag so full.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;m sorry for it, Billy,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;We have enough to think of, ay, and
troubles enough, too, not to need the strife and bitterness of another
contest amongst us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thrue for ye, miss, indeed,&rdquo; rejoined Billy. &lsquo;&ldquo;Tis wishing them far
enough I am, them same elections; the bag does be a stone heavier every
day till it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Mary, half smiling at the remark.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thrue as I &lsquo;m here, miss. I would n&rsquo;t wonder if it was the goold for
bribin&rsquo; the chaps makes it weigh so much.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And is there any other news stirring in the town, Billy?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Next to none, miss. They were talkin&rsquo; of putting up ould Nelligan&rsquo;s son
for the mimber; and more says the Magennis of Barnagheela will stand.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A most excellent choice that would be, certainly,&rdquo; said Mary, laughing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faix! I heerd of another that wasn&rsquo;t much better, miss.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And who could that be?&rdquo; asked Mary, in astonishment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But sure you&rsquo;d know better than me, if it was thrue, more by token it
would be the master&rsquo;s own orders.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, Billy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I mean, miss, that it&rsquo;s only his Honer, Mr. Martin, could have the power
to make Maurice Scanlan a Parlimint man.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And has any one hinted at such a possibility?&rdquo; said she, in astonishment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, then, it was the talk of the market this mornin&rsquo;, and many a one
said he&rsquo;s the very fellow would get in.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is he such a general favorite in Oughterard?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s that, miss,&rdquo; said Billy, thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe some likes him, and more is afraid of him; but he himself knows
everybody and everybody&rsquo;s business. He can raise the rent upon this man,
take it off that; &lsquo;tis his word can make a barony-constable or one of the
watch. They say he has the taxes, too, in his power, and can cess you just
as he likes. Be my conscience, he &lsquo;s all as one as the Prime Minister.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Just as Billy had delivered this sage reflection they had reached the hall
door, where, having consigned the letter-bag to the hands of a servant, he
turned his steps to the kitchen, to take an &ldquo;air of the fire&rdquo; before he
set out homeward. Mary Martin had not advanced many steps within the hall
when both her hands were cordially grasped, and a kind voice, which she at
once recognized as Mr. Repton&rsquo;s, said, &ldquo;Here I am, my dear Miss Martin;
arrived in time, too, to welcome you home again. You paid me a visit
yesterday&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; broke she in; &ldquo;but you were shaking your ambrosial curls at the
time, browbeating the bench, or cajoling the jury, or something of that
sort.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That I was; but I must own with scant success. You &lsquo;ve heard how that
young David of Oughterard slew the old Goliath of Dublin? Well, shall I
confess it? I&rsquo;m glad of it. I feel proud to think that the crop of clever
fellows in Ireland is flourishing, and that when I, and a dozen like me,
pass away, our places will be filled by others that will keep the repute
of our great profession high in the public estimation.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This is worthy of you, sir,&rdquo; cried Mary, pressing the arm ahe leaned on
more closely.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And now, my dear Miss Mary,&rdquo; said he, as they entered the drawing-room,&mdash;&ldquo;now
that I have light to look at you, let me make my compliments on your
appearance. Handsomer than ever, I positively declare. They told me in the
town that you half killed yourself with fatigue; that you frequently were
days long on horseback, and nights watching by sick-beds; but if this be
the result, benevolence is indeed its own reward.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my dear Mr. Repton, I see you do not keep all your flatteries for the
jury-box.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My moments are too limited here to allow me time for an untruth. I must
be off; to-night I have a special retainer for a great record at
Roscommon, and at this very instant I should be poring over deeds and
parchments, instead of gazing at &lsquo;orbs divinely blue;&rsquo; not but, I believe,
now that I look closer, yours are hazel.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let me order dinner, then, at once,&rdquo; said she, approaching the bell.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have done that already, my dear,&rdquo; said he, gayly; &ldquo;and what is more, I
have dictated the bill of fare. I guessed what a young lady&rsquo;s simple meal
might be, and I have been down to the cook, and you shall see the result.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then it only remains for me to think of the cellar. What shall it be,
sir? The Burgundy that you praised so highly last winter, or the Port that
my uncle preferred to it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I declare that I half suspect your uncle was right. Let us move for a new
trial, and try both over again,&rdquo; said he, laughing, as she left the room.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just to think of such a girl in such a spot,&rdquo; cried he to himself, as he
walked alone, up and down the room; &ldquo;beauty, grace, fascination,&mdash;all
that can charm and attract; and then, such a nature, childlike in gayety,
and chivalrous,&mdash;ay, chivalrous as a chevalier!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I see, sir, you are rehearsing for Roscommon,&rdquo; said Mary, who entered the
room while he was yet declaiming alone; &ldquo;but I must interrupt you, for the
soup is waiting.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I obey the summons,&rdquo; said he tendering his arm. And they both entered the
dinner-room.
</p>
<p>
So long as the meal lasted, Repton&rsquo;s conversation was entirely devoted to
such topics as he might have discussed at a formal dinner-party. He talked
of the world of society, its deaths, births, and marriages; its changes of
place and amusement. He narrated the latest smart things that were going
the round of the clubs, and hinted at the political events that were
passing. But the servants gone, and the chairs drawn closer to the blazing
hearth, his tone changed at once, and in a voice of tremulous kindness he
said,&mdash;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to think of the solitude of this life of yours!&mdash;nay,
hear me out. I say this, not for <i>you</i>, since in the high devotion of
a noble purpose you are above all its penalties; but I cannot endure to
think that <i>we</i> should permit it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; said Mary, rapidly, &ldquo;what you deem solitude is scarcely
such; each day is so filled with its duties, that when I come back here of
an evening, it often happens that my greatest enjoyment is the very sense
of isolation that awaits me. Do you know,&rdquo; added she, &ldquo;that very often the
letter-bag lies unopened by me till morning? And as to newspapers, there
they lie in heaps, their covers unbroken to this hour. Such is actually
the case to-day. I haven&rsquo;t read my letters yet.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I read mine in my bed,&rdquo; cried Repton. &ldquo;I have them brought to me by
candlelight in winter, and I reflect over all the answers while I am
dressing. Some of the sharpest things I have ever said have occurred to me
while I was shaving; not,&rdquo; added he, hastily, &ldquo;but one&rsquo;s really best
things are always impromptu. Just as I said t&rsquo; other day to the Viceroy,&mdash;a
somewhat felicitous one. He was wishing that some historian would choose
for his subject the lives of Irish Lord-Lieutenants; not, he remarked, in
a mere spirit of party, or with the levity of partisanship, but in a
spirit becoming the dignity of history,&mdash;such as Hume himself might
have done. &lsquo;Yes, my Lord,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;your observation is most just; it
should be a continuation of Rapine.&rsquo; Eh! it was a home-thrust, wasn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;&lsquo;a
continuation of Rapine.&rsquo;&rdquo; And the old man laughed till his eyes ran over.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do these great folk ever thoroughly forgive such things?&rdquo; asked Mary.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear child, their self-esteem is so powerful they never feel them; and
even when they do, the chances are that they store them up in their
memories, to retail afterwards as their own. I have detected my own stolen
property more than once; but always so damaged by wear, and disfigured by
ill-usage, that I never thought of reclaiming it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The affluent need never fret for a little robbery,&rdquo; said Mary, smiling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, but they may like to be the dispensers of their own riches,&rdquo; rejoined
Repton, who never was happier than when able to carry out another&rsquo;s
illustration.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is Lord Reckington agreeable?&rdquo; asked Mary, trying to lead him on to any
other theme than that of herself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He is eminently so. Like all men of his class, he makes more of a small
stock in trade than we with our heads full can ever pretend to. Such men
talk well, for they think fluently. Their tact teaches them the popular
tone on every subject, and they have the good sense never to rise above
it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And Massingbred, the secretary, what of him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A very well-bred gentleman, strongly cased in the triple armor of
official dulness. Such men converse as stupid whist-players play cards;
they are always asking to &lsquo;let them see the last trick;&rsquo; and the
consequence is they are ever half an hour behind the rest of the world.
Ay, Miss Mary, and this is an age where one must never be half a second in
arrear. This is really delicious Port; and now that the Burgundy is
finished, I think I prefer it. Tell Martin I said so when you write to
him. I hope the cellar is well stocked with it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was so when my uncle went away, but I fear I have made great inroads
upon it. It was my chief remedy with the poor.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;With the poor! such wine as this,&mdash;the richest grape that ever
purpled over the Douro! Do you tell me that you gave this to these&mdash;Heaven
forgive me, what am I saying? Of course you gave it; you gave them what
was fifty times more precious,&mdash;the kind ministerings of your own
angelic nature, the soft words and soft looks and smiles that a prince
might have knelt for. I &lsquo;m not worthy to drink another glass of it,&rdquo; added
he, as he pushed the decanter from him towards the centre of the table.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But you shall, though,&rdquo; said Mary, filling his glass, &ldquo;and it shall be a
bumper to my health.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A toast I&rsquo;d stake my life for,&rdquo; said he, reverently, as he lifted her
hand to his lips and kissed it with all the deference of a courtier. &ldquo;And
now,&rdquo; added he, refilling his glass, &ldquo;I drink this to the worthy fellow
whose portrait is before me; and may he soon come back again.&rdquo; He arose as
he spoke, and giving his hand to Mary, led her into the drawing-room. &ldquo;Ay,
my dear Miss Mary,&rdquo; said he, following up the theme in his own thoughts,
&ldquo;it is here your uncle ought to be. When the army is in rout and dismay,
the general&rsquo;s presence is the talisman that restores discipline.
Everything around us at this moment is full of threatening danger. The
catalogue of the assizes is a dark record; I never saw its equal, no more
have I ever witnessed anything to compare with the dogged indifference of
the men arraigned. The Irishman is half a fatalist by nature; it will be
an evil hour that makes him wholly one!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But still,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;you &lsquo;d scarcely counsel his return here at this
time. The changes that have taken place would fret him deeply, not to
speak of even worse!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She delivered the last few words in a voice broken and trembling; and
Repton, turning quickly towards her, said,&mdash;&ldquo;I know what you point
at: the irritated feeling of the people, and that insolent menace they
dared to affix to his own door.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You heard of that, then?&rdquo; cried she, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure, I heard of it; and I heard how your own hands tore it down,
and riding with it into the midst of them at Kiltimmon market, you said,
‘I &lsquo;ll give five hundred pounds to him who shows me who did this, and I
‘ll forfeit five hundred more if I do not horsewhip the coward from the
county.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mary hid her face within her hands; but closely as she pressed them there,
the warm tears would force their way through, and fall, dropping on her
bosom.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are a noble girl,&rdquo; cried he, in ecstasy; &ldquo;and in all your great
trials there is nothing finer than this, that the work of your benevolence
has never been stayed by the sense of ill-requital, and you have never
involved the character of a people in the foul crime of a miscreant.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How could I so wrong them, sir?&rdquo; broke she out. &ldquo;Who better than myself
can speak of their glorious courage, their patient resignation, their
noble self-devotion? Has not the man, sinking under fever, crawled from
his bed to lead me to the house of another deeper in misery than himself?
Have I not seen the very poorest sharing the little alms bestowed upon
their wretchedness? Have I not heard the most touching words of gratitude
from lips growing cold in death? You may easily show me lands of greater
comfort, where the blessings of wealth and civilization are more widely
spread; but I defy you to point to any where the trials of a whole people
have been so great and so splendidly sustained.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not ask the privilege of reply,&rdquo; said Repton; &ldquo;perhaps I &lsquo;d rather
be convinced by you than attempt to gainsay one word of your argument.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;At your peril, sir,&rdquo; said she, menacing him with her finger, while a
bright smile lit up her features.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The chaise is at the door, sir,&rdquo; said a servant, entering and addressing
Repton.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Already!&rdquo; exclaimed he. &ldquo;Why, my dear Miss Mary, it can&rsquo;t surely be eight
o&rsquo;clock. No; but,&rdquo; added he, looking at his watch, &ldquo;it only wants a
quarter of ten, and I have not said one half of what I had to say, nor
heard a fourth of what you had to tell me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let the postboy put up his horses, William,&rdquo; said Miss Martin, &ldquo;and bring
tea.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A most excellent suggestion,&rdquo; chimed in Repton. &ldquo;Do you know, my dear,
that we old bachelors never thoroughly appreciate all that we have missed
in domesticity till we approach a tea-table. We surround ourselves with
fifty mockeries of home-life; we can manage soft carpets, warm curtains,
snug dinners, but somehow our cup of tea is a rude imitation that only
depicts the inaccuracy of the copy. Without the priestess the tea-urn
sings forth no incantation.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How came it that Mr. Repton remained a Benedict?&rdquo; asked she, gayly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;By the old accident, that he would n&rsquo;t take what he might have, and could
n&rsquo;t get what he wished. Add to that,&rdquo; continued he, after a pause, &ldquo;when a
man comes to a certain time of life without marrying, the world has given
to him a certain place, assigned to him, as it were, a certain part which
would be utterly marred by a wife. The familiarity of one&rsquo;s female
acquaintance&mdash;the pleasantest spot in old bachelorhood&mdash;could
n&rsquo;t stand such an ordeal; and the hundred-and-one eccentricities
pardonable and pardoned in the single man would be condemned in the
married one. You shake your head. Well, now, I &lsquo;ll put it to the test.
Would you, or could you, make me your confidant so unreservedly if there
were such a person as Mrs. Repton in the world? Not a bit of it, my dear
child. We old bachelors are the lay priests of society, and many come to
us with confessions they &lsquo;d scruple about making to the regular
authorities.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; said she, thoughtfully; &ldquo;at all events, <i>I</i>
should have no objection to you as my confessor.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I may have to claim that promise one of these day yet,&rdquo; said he,
significantly. &ldquo;Eh, here comes William again. Well, the postboy won&rsquo;t
wait, or something has gone wrong. Eh, William, what is it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The boy&rsquo;s afraid, sir, if you don&rsquo;t go soon, that there will be no
passing the river at Barnagheela,&mdash;the flood is rising every minute.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And already the water is too deep,&rdquo; cried Mary. &ldquo;Give the lad his supper,
William. Let him make up his cattle, and say that Mr. Repton remains here
for the night.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And Mr. Repton obeys,&rdquo; said he, bowing; &ldquo;though what is to become of
‘Kelly <i>versus</i> Lenaham and another,&rsquo; is more than I can say.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They &lsquo;ll have so many great guns, sir,&rdquo; said Mary, laughing; &ldquo;won&rsquo;t they
be able to spare a twenty-four pounder?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I ought, at least, to appear in the battery, my dear. They &lsquo;ll say
that I stayed away on account of that young fellow Nelligan; he has a
brief in that cause, and I know he &lsquo;d like another tussle with me. By the
way, Miss Mary, that reminds me that I promised him to make his&mdash;no,
not his excuses, he was too manly for that; but his&mdash;his explanations
to you about yesterday&rsquo;s business. He was sorely grieved at the part
assigned him; he spoke feelingly of all the attentions he once met at your
uncle&rsquo;s hands, but far more so of certain kindnesses shown to his mother
by yourself; and surmising that you might be unaware of the exacting
nature of our bar etiquette, that leaves no man at liberty to decline a
cause, he tortured himself inventing means to set himself right with you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I know your etiquette, sir, and I respect it; and Mr. Nelligan never
stood higher in my estimation than by his conduct of yesterday. You can
tell him, therefore, that you saw there was no necessity to touch on the
topic; it will leave less unpleasantness if we should meet again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What a diplomatist it is!&rdquo; said Repton, smiling affectionately at her.
&ldquo;How successful must all this tact be when engaged with the people! Nay,
no denial; you know in your heart what subtle devices it supplies you
with.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet, I &lsquo;m not so certain that what you call my diplomacy may not have
involved me in some trouble,&mdash;at least, there is the chance of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;As how, my dear child?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You shall hear, sir. You know the story of that poor girl at Barnagheela,
whom they call Mrs. Magennis? Well, her old grandfather&mdash;as noble a
heart as ever beat&mdash;had never ceased to pine after her fall. She had
been the very light of his life, and he loved her on, through her sorrow,
if not her shame, till, as death drew nigh him, unable to restrain his
craving desire, he asked me to go and fetch her, to give her his last kiss
and receive his last blessing. It was a task I had fain have declined,
were such an escape open to me, but I could not. In a word, I went and did
his bidding. She stayed with him till he breathed his last breath, and
then&mdash;in virtue of some pledge I hear that she made him&mdash;she
fled, no one knows whither. All trace of her is lost; and though I have
sent messengers on every side, none have yet discovered her.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Suicide is not the vice of our people,&rdquo; said Repton, gravely.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know that well, and the knowledge makes me hopeful. But what sufferings
are yet before her, what fearful trials has she to meet!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; cried Repton, rising and pacing the room, &ldquo;you have courage,
young lady, that would do honor to a man. You brave the greatest perils
with a stout-heartedness that the best of us could scarcely summon.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But, in this case, the peril is not mine, sir.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am not so sure of that, Miss Mary,&rdquo; said Repton, doubtingly,&mdash;&ldquo;I
‘m not so sure of that.&rdquo; And, with crossed arms and bent-down head, he
paced the room slowly back and forwards. &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; muttered he to himself,
&ldquo;Thursday night&mdash;Friday, at all events&mdash;will close the record. I
can speak to evidence on the morning, and be back here again some time in
the night. Of course it is a duty,&mdash;it is more than a duty.&rdquo; Then he
added, aloud, &ldquo;There &lsquo;s the moon breaking out, and a fine breezy sky. I
‘ll take the road, Miss Mary, and, with your good leave, I &lsquo;ll drink tea
with you on Friday evening. Nay, my dear, the rule is made absolute.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if it secures me a longer visit on your return.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A few moments afterwards saw Repton seated in the corner of his chaise,
and hurrying onward at speed. His eyes soon closed in slumber, and as he
sank off to rest, his lips murmured gently, &ldquo;My Lord, in rising to address
the Court, under circumstances of no ordinary difficulty, and in a case
where vast interest, considerable influence, and, I may add&mdash;may add&mdash;&rdquo;
 The words died away, and he was asleep.

<h2>
CHAPTER XVII. LADY DOROTHEA&rsquo;S LETTER
</h2>
<p>
Though it was late when Repton took his departure, Mary Martin felt no
inclination for sleep, but addressed herself at once to examine the letter
bag, whose contents seemed more than usually bulky. Amid a mass of
correspondence about the estate, she came at length upon the foreign
letters, of which there were several from the servants to their friends or
relations at Cro&rsquo; Martin,&mdash;all, as usual, under cover to Miss Martin;
and at last she found one in Lady Dorothea&rsquo;s own hand, for herself,&mdash;a
very rare occurrence; nay, indeed, it was the first epistle her Ladyship
had favored her with since her departure.
</p>
<p>
It was not, then, without curiosity as to the cause that Mary broke the
large seal and read as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Carlsruhe, Saturday Evening, Cour de Bade.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear Niece,&mdash;It was only yesterday, when looking over your
uncle&rsquo;s papers, I chanced upon a letter of yours, dated some five or six
weeks back, and which, to my great astonishment, I discovered had never
been communicated to me,&mdash;though this mark of deficient confidence
will doubtless seem less surprising to <i>you</i>.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To bring your letter to your mind, <i>I</i> may observe it is one in
which you describe the condition of the people on the estate, and the
fatal inroads then making upon them by famine and pestilence. It is not my
intention here to advert to what may possibly be a very natural error in
your account,&mdash;the exaggerated picture you draw of their sufferings;
your sympathy with them, and your presence to witness much of what they
are enduring, will explain and excuse the highly colored statement of
their sorrows. It were to be wished that an equally valid apology could be
made for what I am forced to call the importunity of your demands in their
favor. Five of your six last letters now before me are filled with appeals
for abatements of rent, loans to carry out improvements, stipends for
schoolmasters, doctors, scripture-readers, and a tribe of other
hangers-on, that really seem to augment in number as the pauperism of the
people increases. However ungracious the task of disparaging the accuracy
of your view, I have no other alternative but to accept it, and hence I am
forced to pen these lines myself in preference to committing the office to
another.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It really seems to me that you regard our position as landed proprietors
in the light of a mere stewardship, and that it is our bounden duty to
expend upon the tenantry the proceeds of the estate, reserving a scanty
percentage, perhaps, for ourselves to live upon. How you came to this
opinion, and whence you acquired it, I have no means of knowing. If,
however, it has been the suggestion of your own genius, it is right you
should know that you hold doctrines in common with the most distinguished
communists of modern times, and are quite worthy of a seat of honor beside
those who are now convulsing society throughout Europe.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am unwilling to utter anything like severity towards errors, many of
which take their rise in a mistaken and ill-directed benevolence, because
the original fault of committing the management of this property to your
hands was the work of another. Let me hope that sincere sorrow for so
fatal a mistake may not be the primary cause of his present attack&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
When Mary read so far, she started with a sudden fear; and turning over
the pages of the long letter, she sought for some allusion to her uncle.
At length she found the following lines:&mdash;&ldquo;Your cousin would have
left this for Ireland, but for the sudden seizure your poor uncle has
suffered from, and which came upon him after breakfast, in apparently his
ordinary health. The entire of the left side is attacked,&mdash;the face
particularly,&mdash;and his utterance quite inarticulate.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
For some minutes she could read no more; the warm tears rolled down her
cheeks and dropped heavily on the paper, and she could only mutter to
herself, &ldquo;My poor, dear uncle,&mdash;my last, my only friend in the
world!&rdquo; Drying her eyes, with a great effort she read on:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The remedies have been so far successful as to arrest the progress of the
malady, and his appetite is good, and his spirits, everything considered,
are excellent. Of course, all details of business are strictly excluded
from his presence; and your cousin has assumed whatever authority is
necessary to the management of the property. We thought at one time your
presence here might have been desirable, but, considering the distance,
the difficulty of travelling without suitable companionship, and other
circumstances, it would, on the whole, be a step we should not recommend;
and, indeed, your uncle himself has not expressed any wishes on the
subject.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She dropped the letter at these words, and, covering her face with her
hands, sobbed bitterly and long; at length, and with an effort which taxed
her strength to the utmost, she read on:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Although, however, you are to remain at Cro&rsquo; Martin, it will be more than
ever imperative you should reduce the establishment there within the very
strictest possible limits; and to begin this-reform, I &lsquo;m fully assured it
is necessary you should depose old Mrs. Broon, who is really incapable of
her duties, while her long-acquired habits of expense render her
incompatible with any new regulations to enforce economy. A moderate
pension&mdash;something, however, in accordance with her real wants and
requirements, rather than what might be called her expectations&mdash;should
be settled upon her, and there are several farmers on the estate, any one
of whom would gladly take charge of her. The gardens still figure largely
in the account, and considering the very little probability of our makings
the place a residence again, might be turned to more profitable use. You
will confer with Henderson on the subject, and inquire how far it might be
advisable to cultivate vegetables for market, or convert them into
paddocks for calves, or, in short, anything which, if less remunerative,
should still save the enormous outlay we now hear of I scarcely like to
allude to the stable, knowing how much you lean to the enjoyment of riding
and driving; but really these are times when retrenchment is called for at
every hand; and I am persuaded that for purposes of health walking is
infinitely better than carriage exercise. I know myself, that since I have
taken to the habit of getting out of the carriage at the wells, and
walking twice round the parterre, I feel myself braced and better for the
day.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is not improbable but when the changes I thus suggest, and others
similar to them, are enacted, that you will see to what little purpose a
large house is maintained for the mere accommodation of a single
individual, without suitable means, or indeed any reason whatever, to
dispense them. If then, I say, you should come to this conviction,&mdash;at
which I have already arrived,&mdash;a very great saving might be effected
by obtaining a tenant for Cro&rsquo; Martin, while you, if still desirous of
remaining in the county, might be most comfortably accommodated at the
Hendersons&rsquo;.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Three times did Mary Martin read over this passage before she could bring
herself to believe in its meaning; and hot tears of sorrow coursed down
her cheeks as she became assured of its import.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; went on the epistle&mdash;&ldquo;it is not in your uncle&rsquo;s present
most critical state that I could confer with him on this project, nor
strengthen my advice by what most probably would be <i>his</i> also. I
therefore make the appeal simply to your own sense of what you may think
in accordance with our greatly increased outlay and your own requirements.
Should you receive this suggestion in the spirit in which it is offered, I
think that both for your uncle&rsquo;s satisfaction and your own dignity, the
proposal ought to come from yourself. You could make it to me in a letter,
stating all the reasons in its favor, and of course not omitting to lay
suitable stress upon the isolation of your present life, and the comfort
and security you would derive from the protection of a family. Mrs. H. is
really a very nice person, and her tastes and habits would render her most
companionable; and she would, of course, make you an object of especial
attention and respect. It is, besides, not impossible that the daughter
may soon return&mdash;though this is a point I have not leisure to enter
upon at present. A hundred a year would he a very handsome allowance for
Henderson, and indeed for that sum he ought to keep your pony, if you
still continue your taste for equipage. You would thus be more
comfortable, and really richer,&mdash;that is, have more disposable means&mdash;than
you have hitherto had. I forbear to insist further upon what&mdash;till it
has your own approval&mdash;may be a vain advocacy on my part. I can only
say, in conclusion, that in adopting this plan you would equally consult
what is due to your own dignity, as what is required by your uncle&rsquo;s
interests. Your cousin, I am forced to avow it, has been very silly, very
inconsiderate, not alone in contracting heavy debts, but in raising large
sums to meet them at fabulous rates of interest. The involvements
threaten, from what I can gather, to imperil a considerable part of the
estate, and we are obliged to send for Scanlan to come out here, and
confer with him as to the means of extrication. I feel there is much to be
said in palliation of errors which have their origin in high and generous
qualities. Plantagenet was thrown at a very early age into the society of
a most expensive regiment, and naturally contracted the tastes and habits
around him. Poor fellow, he is suffering severely from the memory of these
early indiscretions, and I see that nothing but a speedy settlement of his
difficulties will ever restore him to his wonted spirits. You will thus
perceive, that if my suggested change of life to you should not conform
entirely to your wishes, that you are in reality only accepting your share
of the sacrifices called for from each of us.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There are a great number of other matters on which I wished to touch,&mdash;some,
indeed, are not exactly within your province, such as the political
fortunes of the borough, whose seat Mr. Massingbred has determined to
vacate. Although not admitting the reason for his conduct, I am strongly
convinced that the step is a mere acknowledgment of an error on his part,
and an effort, however late, at the <i>amende honorable</i>. The
restitution, for so I am forced to regard it, comes most inopportunely,
since it would be a most ill-chosen moment in which to incur the expense
of a contested election; besides that, really your cousin has no desire
whatever for Parliamentary honors. Plantagenet, however, would seem to
have some especial intentions on the subject which he keeps secret, and
has asked of Massingbred not to send off his farewell address to the
constituency for some days. But I will not continue a theme so little
attractive to you.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dr. Schubart has just called to see your uncle. He is not altogether so
satisfied with his state as I could have hoped; he advises change of
scene, and a little more intercourse with the world, and we have some
thought of Nice, if we cannot get on to Naples. Dr. S., to whom I spoke on
the subject of your Irish miseries, tells me that cholera is now the most
manageable of all maladies, if only taken early; that you must enjoin the
persons attacked to a more liberal diet, no vegetables, and a sparing use
of French wines, excepting, he says, the generous &lsquo;Vins du Midi.&rsquo; There is
also a mixture to be taken&mdash;of which he promised me the prescription&mdash;and
a pill every night of arnica or aconite&mdash;I &lsquo;m not quite certain which&mdash;but
it is a perfect specific. He also adds, what must be felt as most
reassuring, that the disease never attacks but the very poorest of the
population. As to typhus, he smiled when I spoke of it. It is, he says, a
mere &lsquo;Gastrite,&rsquo; a malady which modern science actually despises. In fact,
my dear niece, these would seem, like all other Irish misfortunes, the
mere offshoots of her own dark ignorance and barbarism. If it were not for
the great expense&mdash;and of course that consideration decides the
question&mdash;I should have requested you to send over your doctor here
to confer with Dr. Schubart. Indeed, I think it might be a very reasonable
demand to make of the Government, but unhappily my present &lsquo;relations&rsquo;
with my relative Lord Reckington preclude any advances of mine in that
quarter.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was forgetting to add that, with respect to cholera, and indeed fever
generally, that Dr. S. lays great stress upon what he calls the moral
treatment of the people, amusing their minds by easily learned games and
simple pleasures. I fear me, however, that the coarser natures of our
population may not derive adequate amusement from the resources which
would have such eminent success with the enlightened peasant of the Rhine
land. Dr. S., I may remark, is a very distinguished writer on politics,
and daily amazes us with the astounding speculations he is forming as to
the future condition of Europe. His conviction is that our great peril is
Turkey, and that Mohammedanism will be the religion of Europe before the
end of the present century. Those new baths established at Brighton by a
certain Hamet are a mere political agency, a secret propaganda, which his
acuteness has alone penetrated. Miss Henderson has ventured to oppose
these views with something not very far from impertinent ridicule, and for
some time back, Dr. S. only discusses them with myself alone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I had left the remainder of the sheet for any intelligence that might
occur before post hour, but I am suddenly called away, and shall close it
at once. When I was sitting with your uncle awhile ago, I <i>half</i>
broached the project I was suggesting to you, and he seemed highly to
approve of so much as I ventured to tell him. Nothing then is wanting but
your own concurrence to make it as practicable as it is deemed advisable
by your affectionate aunt,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dorothea Martin.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The eccentricities of her aunt&rsquo;s character had always served as
extenuating circumstances with Mary Martin. She knew the violence of her
prejudices, the enormous amount of her self-esteem, and the facility with
which she was ever able to persuade herself that whatever she wished to do
assumed at once all the importance and gravity of a duty! This thorough
appreciation of her peculiarities enabled Mary to bear up patiently under
many sore trials and some actual wrongs. Where the occasion was a light
one, she could afford to smile at such trials, and, even in serious cases,
they palliated the injustice; but here was an instance wherein all her
forgiveness was in vain. To take the moment of her poor uncle&rsquo;s illness&mdash;that
terrible seizure, which left him without self-guidance, if even a will&mdash;to
dictate these hard and humiliating terms, was a downright cruelty. Nor did
it diminish the suffering which that letter cost her that its harsh
conditions seemed dictated by a spirit of contempt for Ireland and its
people. As Mary re-read the letter, she felt that every line breathed this
tone of depreciation. It was to her Ladyship a matter of less than
indifference what became of the demesne, who inhabited the house,&mdash;the
home of &ldquo;the Martins&rdquo; for centuries! She was as little concerned for the
prestige of &ldquo;the old family,&rdquo; as she was interested for the sorrows of the
people. If Mary endeavored to treat these things dispassionately to her
own heart, by dwelling upon all the points which affected others, still,
her own individual wrong would work to the surface, and the bitter and
insulting suggestion made to her rose up before her in all its enormity.
</p>
<p>
She did her very best to turn her thoughts into some other channel,&mdash;to
fix them upon her poor uncle, on his sick-bed, and sorrowing as he was
sure to be; to think of her cousin Harry, struggling against the
embarrassments of his own imprudence; of the old housekeeper, Catty Broon,
to whom she could not summon courage to speak the cruel tidings of her
changed lot,&mdash;but all, all in vain; back she would come to the
humiliation that foreshadowed her own fortune, and threatened to depose
her from her station forever.
</p>
<p>
An indignant appeal to her uncle&mdash;her own father&rsquo;s brother&mdash;was
her first resolve. &ldquo;Let me learn,&rdquo; said she to herself, &ldquo;from his own
lips, that such is the destiny he assigns me; that in return for my tried
affection, my devotion, he has no other recompense than to lower me in
self-esteem and condition together. Time enough, when assured of this, to
decide upon what I shall do. But to whom shall I address this demand?&rdquo;
 thought she again. &ldquo;That dear, kind uncle is now struck down by illness.
It were worse than cruelty to add to his own sorrows any thought of <i>mine</i>.
If he have concurred in Lady Dorothea&rsquo;s suggestion, who knows in what
light it may have been presented to him, by what arguments strengthened,
with what perils contrasted? Is it impossible, too, that the sacrifice may
be imperative? The sale of part of the property, the pressure of heavy
claims,&mdash;all show that it may be necessary to dispose of Cro&rsquo; Martin.
Oh,&rdquo; exclaimed she, in agony, &ldquo;it is but a year ago, that when Mr. Repton
hinted vaguely at such a casualty, how stoutly and indignantly did I
reject it!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Your uncle may choose to live abroad,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;to sell the estate,
perhaps.&rsquo; And I heard him with almost scornful defiance; and now the hour
is come! and even yet I cannot bring myself to believe it. When Repton
drew the picture of the tenantry, forsaken and neglected, the poor
unnoticed, and the sick uncared for, he still forgot to assign me my place
in the sad &lsquo;tableau,&rsquo; and show that in destitution my lot was equal to
their own; the very poorest and meanest had yet some spot, poor and mean
though it were, they called a home, that Mary Martin was the only one an
outcast!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
These gloomy thoughts were darkened as she bethought her that of her
little fortune&mdash;on which, by Scanlan&rsquo;s aid, she had raised a loan&mdash;a
mere fragment remained,&mdash;a few hundred pounds at most. The outlay on
hospitals and medical assistance for the sick had more than quadrupled
what she had estimated. The expense once begun, she had persevered with
almost reckless determination. She had despatched to Dublin, one by one,
the few articles of jewelry and value she possessed for sale; she had
limited her own expenditure to the very narrowest bounds, nor was it till
driven by the utmost urgency that she wrote the appeal to her uncle of
which the reader already knows.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How I once envied Kate Henderson,&rdquo; cried she, aloud, &ldquo;the brilliant
accomplishments she possessed, the graceful charm that her cultivation
threw over society, and the fascination she wielded, by acquirements of
which I knew nothing; but how much more now do I envy her, that in those
same gifts her independence was secured,&mdash;that, high above the
chances of the world, she could build upon her own efforts, and never
descend to a condition of dependence!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Her diminished power amongst the people had been fully compensated by the
sincere love and affection she had won from them by acts of charity and
devotion. Even these, however, owed much of their efficacy to the prestige
of her station. No peasant in Europe puts so high a value on the
intercourse with a rank above his own as does the Irish. The most pleasant
flattery to his nature is the notice of &ldquo;the gentleman,&rdquo; and it was more
than half the boon Mary bestowed upon the poor, that she who sat down
beside the bed, who heated the little drink, who raised the head to
swallow it, was the daughter of the Great House! Would not her altered
fortune destroy this charm? was now her bitter reflection. Up to this
hour, greatly reduced as were the means she dispensed, and the influence
she wielded, she still lived in the proud home of her family, and all
regarded her as the representative of her honored name. But now&mdash;No,
she could not endure the thought! &ldquo;If I must descend to further
privations,&rdquo; said she to herself, &ldquo;let me seek out some new scene,&mdash;some
spot where I am unknown, have never been heard of; there, at least, I
shall be spared the contrast of the past with the present, nor see in
every incident the cruel mockery of my former life.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;how narrow-minded and selfish is all this, how
mean-spirited, to limit the question to my own feelings! Is there no duty
involved in this sacrifice? Shall I not still&mdash;reduced though I be in
fortune&mdash;shall I not still be a source of comfort to many here? Will
not the very fact of my presence assure them that they are not deserted?
They have seen me under some trials, and the lesson has not been
fruitless. Let them then behold me, under heavier ones, not dismayed nor
cast down. What I lose in the prestige of station I shall more than gain
in sympathy; and so I remain!&rdquo; No sooner was the resolve formed than all
her wonted courage came back. Rallying with the stimulus of action before
her, she began to plan out a new life, in which her relation to the people
should be closer and nearer than ever. There was a small ornamental
cottage on the demesne, known as the Chalet, built by Lady Dorothea after
one she had seen in the Oberland; this Mary now determined on for her
home, and there, with Catty Broon alone, she resolved to live.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My aunt,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;can scarcely be so wedded to the Henderson scheme
but that this will equally satisfy her wishes; and while it secures a home
and a resting-place for-poor Catty, it rescues <i>me</i> from what I
should feel as a humiliation.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The day was already beginning to dawn as Mary sat down to answer Lady
Dorothea&rsquo;s letter. Most of her reply referred to her uncle, to whose
affection she clung all the more as her fortunes darkened. She saw all the
embarrassment of proffering her services to nurse and tend him, living, as
he was, amidst his own; but still, she said that of the journey or its
difficulties she should never waste a thought, if her presence at his
sick-bed could afford him the slightest satisfaction. &ldquo;He knows me as a
nurse already,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;But tell him that I have grown, if not wiser,
calmer and quieter than he knew me formerly; that I should not disturb him
by foolish stories, but sit patiently save when he would have me to talk.
Tell him, too, that if changed in many things, in my love to<i> him</i> I
am unaltered.&rdquo; She tried to add more, but could not. The thought that
these lines were to be read to her uncle by Lady Dorothea chilled her, and
the very tones of that supercilious voice seemed to ring in her ears, and
she imagined some haughty or insolent comment to follow them as they were
uttered.
</p>
<p>
With regard to her own future, she, in a few words, remarked upon the
unnecessary expense of maintaining a large house for the accommodation of
a single person, and said that, if her Ladyship concurred in the plan, she
would prefer taking up her home at the Chalet with old Catty for companion
and housekeeper.
</p>
<p>
She pointed out the advantages of a change which, while securing a
comfortable home to them, would equally suggest to their dependants
lessons of thrift and self-sacrifice, and added, half sportively, &ldquo;As for
me, when I find myself <i>en Suisse</i>, I &lsquo;m sure I shall less regret
horses and dogs, and such-like vanities, and take to the delights of a
dairy and cream cheeses with a good grace. Indeed, I &lsquo;m not quite certain
but that Fortune, instead of displacing, will in reality be only
installing me in the position best suited to me. Do not, then, be
surprised, if at your return you find me in sabots and an embroidered
bodice, deep in the mystery of all cottage economics, and well content to
be so.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are quite right, my dear aunt,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;not to entertain me
with politics. The theme is as much above as it is distasteful to me; and
so grovelling are my sentiments, that I &lsquo;d rather hear of the arrival of a
cargo of oatmeal at Kilkieran than learn that the profoundest statesman of
Great Britain had condescended to stand for our dear borough of
Oughterard. At the same time, if Cousin Harry should change his mind, and
turn his ambition towards the Senate, tell him I &lsquo;m quite ready to turn
out and canvass for him to-morrow, and that the hospitalities of the
Chalet shall do honor to the cause. As you speak of sending for Mr.
Scanlan, I leave to him to tell you all the events of our late assizes
here,&mdash;a task I escape from the more willingly, since I have no
successes to record. Mr. Repton, however,&mdash;he paid me a visit
yesterday, and stopped here to dinner,&mdash;says that he has no fears for
the result at the next trial, and honestly confesses that our present
defeat was entirely owing to the skill and ability of the counsel opposed
to us. By some delay or mistake, I don&rsquo;t exactly know which, Scanlan
omitted to send a retainer to young Mr. Nelligan, and who, being employed
for the other side, was the chief cause of our failure. My uncle will be
pleased to learn that Mr. N.&lsquo;s address to the jury was scrupulously free
from any of that invective or attack so frequently levelled at landlords
when defending the rights of property. Repton called it &lsquo;a model of legal
argument, delivered with the eloquence of a first-rate speaker, and the
taste and temper of a gentleman.&rsquo; Indeed, I understand that the tone of
the speech has rendered all the ribaldry usual on such occasions in local
journals impossible, and that the young barrister has acquired anything
but popularity in consequence. Even in this much, is there a dawn of
better things; and under such circumstances a defeat may be more
profitable than a victory.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
With a few kind messages to her uncle, and an earnest entreaty for early
tidings of his state, Mary concluded a letter in which her great
difficulty lay in saying far less than her thoughts dictated, and
conveying as much as she dare trust to Lady Dorothea&rsquo;s interpretation. The
letter concluded and sealed, she lay down, dressed as she was, on her bed,
and fell a-thinking over the future.
</p>
<p>
There are natures to whom the opening of any new vista in life suggests
fully as much of pleasure as anxiety. The prospect of the unknown and the
untried has something of the adventurous about it which more than
counterbalances the casualties of a future. Such a temperament was hers;
and the first sense of sorrowful indignation over, she really began to
speculate upon her cottage life with a certain vague and dreamy enjoyment.
She foresaw, that when Cro&rsquo; Martin Castle fell into other hands, that her
own career ceased, her occupation was gone, and that she should at once
fashion out some new road, and conform herself to new habits. The cares of
her little household would probably not suffice to engage one whose active
mind had hitherto embraced so wide a field of action, and Mary then
bethought her how this leisure might be devoted to study and improvement.
It was only in the eager enthusiasm of her many pursuits that she buried
her sorrows over her neglected and imperfect education; and now a time was
approaching when that reflection could no longer be resisted. She pondered
long and deeply over these thoughts, when suddenly they were interrupted;
but in what way, deserves a chapter of its own,&mdash;albeit a very brief
one.

CHAPTER XVIII. MR. MERL&rsquo;S EXPERIENCES IN THE WEST
</h2>
<p>
&ldquo;What card is this?&mdash;who left it?&rdquo; said Mary, as she took up one from
her breakfast-table.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is a gentleman that came to the inn late last night, miss, and sent a
boy over to ask when he could pay his respects at the castle.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Herman Merl,&rsquo;&mdash;a name I never heard of,&rdquo; muttered Mary to
herself. &ldquo;Doubtless some stranger wishing to see the house. Say, whenever
he pleases, George; and order Sorrel to be ready, saddled and at the door,
within an hour. This must be a busy day,&rdquo; said she, still speaking to
herself, as the servant left the room. &ldquo;At Oughterard before one; a
meeting of the Loan Fund&mdash;I shall need some aid for my hospital; the
Government order for the meal to be countersigned by a justice&mdash;Mr.
Nelligan will do it. Then there &lsquo;s Taite&rsquo;s little boy to be balloted for
in the Orphan House; and Cassidy&rsquo;s son to be sent up to Dublin. Poor
fellow, he has a terrible operation to go through. And I shall need Priest
Rafferty&rsquo;s name to this memorial from the widows; the castle authorities
seem to require it. After that, a visit to Kyle-a-Noe, to see all my poor
sick folk: that will be a long business. I hope I may be able to get down
to the shore and learn some tidings of poor Joan. She never leaves my
thoughts, and yet I feel that no ill has befallen her.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The gentleman that sent the card, miss, is below stairs. He is with Mr.
Crow, at the hall-door,&rdquo; said George.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Show him into the drawing-room, George, and tell Mr. Crow to come here, I
wish to speak to him.&rdquo; And before Mary had put away the papers and letters
which littered the table, the artist entered.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Crow,&rdquo; said Mary, in return for a number of most
courteous salutations, which he was performing in a small semicircle in
front of her. &ldquo;Who is your friend Mr.&mdash;&lsquo;Mr. Herman Merl &lsquo;?&rdquo; read she,
taking up the card.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A friend of your cousin&rsquo;s, Miss Mary,&mdash;of the Captain&rsquo;s. He brought
a letter from him; but he gave it to Scanlan, and somehow Mr. Maurice, I
believe, forgot to deliver it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have no recollection of it,&rdquo; said she, still assorting the papers
before her. &ldquo;What is this visit meant for,&mdash;curiosity, pleasure,
business? Does he wish to see the house?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s Miss Martin herself he&rsquo;d like to see,&rdquo; said Crow, half
slyly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But why so? It&rsquo;s quite clear that I cannot show him any attentions. A
young girl, living as I do here, cannot be expected to receive guests.
Besides, I have other things to attend to. You must do the honors of Cro&rsquo;
Martin, Mr. Crow. You must entertain this gentleman for me. I &lsquo;ll order
luncheon before I go out, and I &lsquo;m sure you &lsquo;ll not refuse me this
service.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish I knew a real service to render you, Miss Mary,&rdquo; said he, with
unfeigned devotedness in his look as he spoke.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I could promise myself as much,&rdquo; said Mary, smiling kindly on
him. &ldquo;Do you happen to know anything of this stranger, Mr. Crow?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing, miss, beyond seeing him this week back at Kilkieran.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I have heard of him, then,&rdquo; broke in Mary. &ldquo;It is of him the people
tell me such stories of benevolence and goodness. It was he that sent the
yawl out to Murran Island with oatmeal and potatoes for the poor. But I
thought they called him Mr. Barry?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure they do; and he&rsquo;s another guess man from him below stairs.
This one here&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Crow now spoke in a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;this one here
is a Jew, I &lsquo;d take the Testament on it, and I &lsquo;d not be surprised if he
was one of them thieving villains that they say robbed the Captain! All
the questions he does be asking about the property, and the rents, if they
‘re well paid, and what arrears there are, shows me that he isn&rsquo;t here for
nothing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know nothing of what you allude to, Mr. Crow,&rdquo; said she, half proudly;
&ldquo;it would ill become <i>me</i> to pry into my cousin&rsquo;s affairs. At the
same time, if the gentleman has no actual business with me, I shall
decline to receive him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He says he has, miss,&rdquo; replied Crow. &ldquo;He says that he wants to speak to
you about a letter he got by yesterday&rsquo;s post from the Captain.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mary heard this announcement with evident impatience; her head was,
indeed, too full of other cares to wish to occupy her attention with a
ceremonial visit. She was in no mood to accept the unmeaning compliments
of a new acquaintance. Shall we dare to insinuate, what after all is a
mere suspicion on our part, that a casual glance at her pale cheeks,
sunken eyes, and careworn features had some share in the obstinacy of her
refusal? She was not, indeed, &ldquo;in looks,&rdquo; and she knew it. &ldquo;Must I repeat
it, Mr. Crow,&rdquo; said she, peevishly, &ldquo;that you can do all this for me, and
save me a world of trouble and inconvenience besides? If there should be&mdash;a
very unlikely circumstance&mdash;anything confidential to communicate,
this gentleman may write it.&rdquo; And with this she left the room, leaving
poor Mr. Crow in a state of considerable embarrassment. Resolving to make
the best of his difficulty, he returned to the drawing-room, and
apologizing to Merl for Miss Martin&rsquo;s absence on matters of great
necessity, he conveyed her request that he would stop for luncheon.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t afraid of me, I hope?&rdquo; said Merl.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I trust not. I rather suspect she is little subject to fear upon any
score,&rdquo; replied Crow.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I must say it&rsquo;s not exactly what I expected. The letter I hold here
from the Captain gives me to understand that his cousin will not only
receive me, but confer with and counsel me, too, in a somewhat important
affair.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I forgot,&rdquo; broke in Crow; &ldquo;you are to write to her, she said,&mdash;that
is, if there really were anything of consequence, which you deemed
confidential, you know,&mdash;you were to write to her.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I never put my hand to paper, Mr. Crow, without well knowing why. When
Herman Merl signs anything, he takes time to consider what&rsquo;s in it,&rdquo; said
the Jew, knowingly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, shall I show you the house,&mdash;there are some clever specimens
of the Dutch masters here?&rdquo; asked Crow, anxious to change the topic.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, with all my heart. I suppose I must accept this privilege as my
experience of the much-boasted Irish hospitality,&rdquo; said he with a sneer,
which required all Crow&rsquo;s self-control to resist answering. To master the
temptation, and give himself a few moments&rsquo; repose, he went about opening
windows and drawing back curtains, so as to admit a fuller and stronger
light upon the pictures along the walls.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; said he, pointing to a large landscape, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a Both, and
a fine one too; as mellow in color and as soft in distance as ever he
painted.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a copy,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;That picture was painted by Woeffel, and
I &lsquo;ll show you his initials, too, A. W., before we leave it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It came from the Dordrecht gallery, and is an undoubted Both!&rdquo; exclaimed
Crow, angrily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I saw it there myself, and in very suitable company, too, with a Snyders
on one side and a Rubens on t&rsquo; other, the Snyders being a Faltk, and the
Rubens a Metziger; the whole three being positively dear at twenty pounds.
Ay, here it is,&rdquo; continued he, pointing to the hollow trunk of a decayed
tree: &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the initials. So much for your original by Both.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll allow that to be a Mieris?&rdquo; said Crow, passing on to
another.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t opened the shutters, perhaps I might,&rdquo; said Merl; &ldquo;but with
a good dash of light I see it is by Jansens,&mdash;and a clever copy,
too.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A copy!&rdquo; exclaimed the other.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A good copy,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;The King of Bavaria has the original. It is in the
small collection at Hohen Schwangau.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; cried he, turning to a small unfinished sketch in
oils.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I often wondered who did it,&rdquo; cried Crow.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That! Why, can you doubt, sir? That&rsquo;s a bit of Vandyke&rsquo;s own. It was one
of the hundred and fifty rough things he threw off as studies for his
great picture of St. Martin parting his cloak.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say so,&rdquo; said Crow, in delight. &ldquo;I felt, when I
looked at it, that it was a great hand threw in them colors.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You call this a Salvator Rosa, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Merl, as he stood before
a large piece representing a bandit&rsquo;s bivouac in a forest, with a pale
moonlight stealing through the trees.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that we do,&rdquo; said Crow, stoutly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s quite sufficient to have blended lights, rugged
foregrounds, and plenty of action to make a Salvator; but let me tell you,
sir, that it&rsquo;s not even a copy of him. It is a bad&mdash;ay, and a very
bad&mdash;Haemlens,&mdash;an Antwerp fellow that lived by poor
facsimiles.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear!&rdquo; cried Crow, despairingly. &ldquo;Did I ever hear the like of
this!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are these your best things, Mr. Crow?&rdquo; said Merl, surveying the room with
an air of consummate depreciation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There are others. There are some portraits and a number of small cabinet
pictures.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Gerard Dows, and Jansens, and such like?&rdquo; resumed Merl; &ldquo;I understand: a
mellow brown tint makes them, just as a glossy white satin petticoat makes
a Terburg. Mr. Crow, you &lsquo;ve caught a Tartar,&rdquo; said he, with a grin.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a man in Europe can detect a copy from the original sooner
than him before you. Now seven out of every eight of these here are
veritable &lsquo;croûtes,&rsquo;&mdash;what we call &lsquo;croûtes,&rsquo; sir,&mdash;things sold
at Christie&rsquo;s, and sent off to the Continent to be hung up in old châteaux
in Flanders, or dilapidated villas in Italy, where your exploring
Englishman discovers them by rare good luck, and brings them home with him
as Cuyps or Claudes or Vandykes. I&rsquo;ll undertake,&rdquo; said he, looking around
him,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll undertake to furnish you with a gallery, in every respect
the duplicate of this, for&mdash;let me see&mdash;say three hundred
pounds. Now, Mr. Crow,&rdquo; said Merl, taking a chair, and spreading out his
legs before the fire, &ldquo;will you candidly answer me one question?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tell me what it is,&rdquo; said Crow, cautiously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose by this time,&rdquo; said Merl, &ldquo;you are tolerably well satisfied
that Herman Merl is not very easily duped? I mean to say that at least
there are <i>softer</i> fellows to be found than the humble individual who
addresses you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I trust there are, indeed,&rdquo; said the other, sighing, &ldquo;or it would be a
mighty poor world for Simmy Crow and the likes of him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I think so too,&rdquo; said Merl, chuckling to himself. &ldquo;The wide-awake
ones have rather the best of it. But, to come back to my question, I was
simply going to ask you if the whole of the Martin estate&mdash;house,
demesne, woods, gardens, quarries, farms, and fisheries&mdash;was not
pretty much of the same sort of thing as this here gallery?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How? What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Crow, whose temper was barely, and with
some difficulty, restrainable.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I mean, in plain words, a regular humbug,&mdash;that&rsquo;s all! and no more
the representative of real value than these daubs here are the works of
the great masters whose names they counterfeit.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Look here, sir,&rdquo; said Crow, rising, and approaching the other with a face
of angry indignation, &ldquo;for aught I know, you may be right about these
pictures. The chances are you are a dealer in such wares,&mdash;at least
you talk like one,&mdash;but of the family that lived under this roof, and
whose bread I have eaten for many a day, if you utter one word that even
borders on disrespect,&mdash;if you as much as hint at&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
What was to be the conclusion of Mr. Crow&rsquo;s menace we have no means of
recording, for a servant, rushing in at the instant, summoned the artist
with all speed to Miss Martin&rsquo;s presence. He found her, as he entered,
with flushed cheeks and eyes flashing angrily, in one of the deep recesses
of a window that looked out upon the lawn.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come here, sir,&rdquo; cried she, hurriedly,&mdash;&ldquo;come here, and behold a
sight such as you scarcely ever thought to look upon from these windows.
Look here!&rdquo; And she pointed to an assemblage of about a hundred people,
many of whom were rudely armed with stakes, gathered around the chief
entrance of the castle. In the midst was a tall man, mounted upon a
wretched horse, who seemed from his gestures to be haranguing the mob, and
whom Crow speedily recognized to be Magennis of Barnagheela.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What does all this mean?&rdquo; asked he, in astonishment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It means this, sir,&rdquo; said she, grasping his arm and speaking in a voice
thick from passionate eagerness. &ldquo;That these people whom you see there
have demanded the right to enter the house and search it from basement to
roof. They are in quest of one that is missing; and although I have given
my word of honor that none such is concealed here, they have dared to
disbelieve me, and declare they will see for themselves. They might know
me better,&rdquo; added she, with a bitter smile,&mdash;&ldquo;they might know me
better, and that I no more utter a falsehood than I yield to a menace.
See!&rdquo; exclaimed she, &ldquo;they are passing through the flower-garden,&mdash;they
are approaching the lower windows. Take a horse, Mr. Crow, and ride for
Kiltimmon; there is a police-station there,&mdash;bring up the force with
you,&mdash;lose no time, I entreat you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But how&mdash;leave you here all alone?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have no fears on that score, sir,&rdquo; said she, proudly; &ldquo;they may insult
the roof that shelters me, to myself they will offer no outrage. But be
quick; away at once, and with speed!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Had Mr. Crow been, what it must be owned had been difficult, a worse
horseman than he was, he would never have hesitated to obey this behest.
Ere many minutes, therefore, he was in the saddle and flying across
country at a pace such as he never imagined any energy could have exacted
from him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They have got a ladder up to the windows of the large drawing-room, Miss
Mary,&rdquo; said a servant; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll be in before many minutes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Taking down two splendidly ornamented pistols from above the
chimney-piece, Mary examined the priming, and ordering the servant away,
she descended by a small private stair to the drawing-room beneath.
Scarcely, however, had she crossed the threshold than she was met by a man
eagerly hurrying away. Stepping back in astonishment, and with a face pale
as death, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Is it Miss Martin?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied she, firmly; &ldquo;and your name?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Merl&mdash;Herman Merl,&rdquo; said he, with a stealthy glance towards the
windows, on the outside of which two fellows were now seated,
communicating with those below.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;This is not a moment for much ceremony, sir,&rdquo; said she, promptly; &ldquo;but
you are here opportunely. These people will have it that I am harboring
here one that they are in pursuit of. I have assured them of their error,
I have pledged my word of honor upon it, but they are not satisfied. They
declare that they will search the house, and <i>I</i> as firmly declare
they-shall not.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But the person is really not here?&rdquo; broke in Merl.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have said so, sir,&rdquo; rejoined she, haughtily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then why not let them search? Egad, I&rsquo;d say, look away to your heart&rsquo;s
content, pry into every hole and corner you please, only don&rsquo;t do any
mischief to the furniture&mdash;don&rsquo;t let any&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was about to ask your assistance, sir, but your counsel saves me from
the false step. To one who proffers such wise advice, arguments like
these&rdquo;&mdash;and she pointed to the pistols&mdash;&ldquo;arguments like these
would be most distasteful; and yet let us see if others may not be of your
mind too.&rdquo; And steadily aiming her weapon for a second or two, she sent a
ball through the window, about a foot above the head of one of the fellows
without. Scarcely had the report rung out and the splintering glass
fallen, than the two men leaped to the ground, while a wild cheer, half
derision, half anger, burst from the mob beneath. &ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; continued
she, with a smile of a very peculiar meaning, as she turned towards Merl,&mdash;&ldquo;now,
sir, you will perceive that you have got into very indiscreet company,
such as I &lsquo;m sure Captain Martin&rsquo;s letter never prepared you for; and
although it is not exactly in accordance with the usual notions of Irish
hospitality to point to the door, perhaps you will be grateful to me when
I say that you can escape by that corridor. It leads to a stair which will
conduct you to the stable-yard. I&rsquo;ll order a saddle-horse for you. I
suppose you ride?&rdquo; And really the glance which accompanied these words was
not a flattery.
</p>
<p>

<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">

</div>
<p>
However the proposition might have met Mr.&rsquo; Merl&rsquo;s wishes there is no
means of knowing, for a tremendous crash now interrupted the colloquy, and
the same instant the door of the drawing-room was burst open, and
Magennis, followed by a number of country people, entered.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; cried he, rudely, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;d not be denied. It&rsquo;s your own
fault if you would drive me to enter here by force.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, sir, force has done it,&rdquo; said she, taking a seat as she spoke. &ldquo;I
am here alone, and you may be proud of the achievement!&rdquo; The glance she
directed towards Merl made that gentleman shrink back, and eventually
slide noiselessly from the room, and escape from the scene altogether.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll send any one with me through the house, Miss Martin,&rdquo; began
Magennis, in a tone of much subdued meaning&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; broke she in&mdash;&ldquo;no,
sir, I&rsquo;ll give no such order. You have already had my solemn word of
honor, assuring you that there was not any one concealed here. The same
incredulous disrespect you have shown to my word would accompany whatever
direction I gave to my servants. Go wherever you please; for the time you
are the master here. Mark me, sir,&rdquo; said she, as, half crestfallen and in
evident shame, he was about to move from the room&mdash;&ldquo;mark me, sir, if
I feel sorry that one who calls himself a gentleman should dishonor his
station by discrediting the word, the plighted word, of a lady, yet I can
forgive much to him whose feelings are under the impulse of passion. But
how shall I speak my contempt for <i>you</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;and she turned a
withering look of scorn on the men who followed him,&mdash;&ldquo;for you, who
have dared to come here to insult me,&mdash;I, that if you had the least
spark of honest manhood in your natures, you had died rather than have
offended? Is this your requital for the part I have borne amongst you? Is
it thus that you repay the devotion by which I have squandered all that I
possessed, and would have given my life, too, for you and yours? Is it
thus, think you, that your mothers and wives and sisters would requite me?
Or will they welcome you back from your day&rsquo;s work, and say, Bravely done?
You have insulted a lone girl in her home, outraged the roof whence she
never issued save to serve you, and taught her to believe that the taunts
your enemies cast upon you, and which she once took as personal affronts
to herself, that they are just and true, and as less than you merited. Go
back, men,&rdquo; added she, in a voice trembling with emotion,&mdash;&ldquo;go back,
while it is time. Go back in shame, and let me never know who has dared to
offer me this insult!&rdquo; And she hid her face between her hands, and bent
down her head upon her lap. For several minutes she remained thus,
overwhelmed and absorbed by intensely painful emotion, and when she lifted
up her head, and looked around, they were gone! A solemn silence reigned
on every side; not a word, nor a footfall, could be heard. She rushed to
the window just in time to see a number of men slowly entering the wood,
amidst whom she recognized Magennis, leading his horse by the bridle, and
following the others, with bent-down head and sorrowful mien.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, thank Heaven for this!&rdquo; cried she, passionately, as the tears gushed
out and coursed down her face. &ldquo;Thank Heaven that they are not as others
call them&mdash;cold-hearted and treacherous, craven in their hour of
trial, and cruel in the day of their vengeance! I knew them better!&rdquo; It
was long before she could sufficiently subdue her emotion to think calmly
of what had occurred. At last she bethought her of Mr. Merl, and
despatched a servant in his pursuit, with a polite request that he would
return. The man came up with Merl as he had reached the small gate of the
park, but no persuasions, no entreaties, could prevail on that gentleman
to retrace his steps; nay, he was frank enough to say, &ldquo;He had seen quite
enough of the West,&rdquo; and to invoke something very unlike benediction on
his head if he ever passed another day in Galway.

<h2>
CHAPTER XIX. MR. MERL&rsquo;S &ldquo;LAST&rdquo; IRISH IMPRESSION
</h2>
<p>
Never once turning his head towards Cro&rsquo; Martin, Mr. Merl set out for
Oughterard, where, weary and footsore, he arrived that same evening. His
first care was to take some refreshment; his next to order horses for
Dublin early for the following morning. This done, he sat down to write to
Captain Martin, to convey to him what Merl designated as a &ldquo;piece of his
mind,&rdquo; a phrase which, in popular currency, is always understood to imply
the very reverse of any flattery. The truth was, Mr. Merl began to suspect
that his Irish liens were a very bad investment, that property in that
country was held under something like a double title, the one conferred by
law, the other maintained by a resolute spirit and a stout heart; that
parchments required to be seconded by pistols, and that he who owned an
estate must always hold himself in readiness to fight for it.
</p>
<p>
Now, these were all very unpalatable considerations. They rendered
possession perilous, they made sale almost impossible. In the cant phrase
of Ceylon, the Captain had sold him a wild elephant; or, to speak less
figuratively, disposed of what he well knew the purchaser could never
avail himself of. If Mr. Merl was an emblem of blandness and good temper
at the play-table, courteous and conceding at every incident of the game,
it was upon the very wise calculation that the politeness was profitable.
The little irregularities that he pardoned all gave him an insight into
the character of his antagonists; and where he appeared to have lost a
battle, he had gained more than a victory in knowledge of the enemy.
</p>
<p>
These blandishments were, however, no real part of the man&rsquo;s natural
temperament, which was eminently distrustful and suspicious, wary to
detect a blot, prompt and sharp to hit it. A vague, undefined impression
had now come over him that the Captain had overreached him; that even if
unincumbered,&mdash;which was far from the case,&mdash;this same estate
was like a forfeited territory, which to own a man must assert his mastery
with the strong hand of force. &ldquo;I should like to see myself settling down
amongst those savages,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;collecting my rents with dragoons, or
levying a fine with artillery. Property, indeed! You might as well convey
to me by bill of sale the right over a drove of wild buffaloes in South
America, or give me a title to a given number of tigers in Bengal. He&rsquo;d be
a bold man that would even venture to come and have a look at &lsquo;his own.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was in this spirit, therefore, that he composed his epistle, which
assuredly lacked nothing on the score of frankness and candor. All his
&ldquo;Irish impressions&rdquo; had been unfavorable. He had eaten badly, he had slept
worse; the travelling was rude, the climate detestable; and lastly, where
he had expected to have been charmed with the ready wit, and amused with
the racy humor of the people, he had only been terrified&mdash;terrified
almost to death&mdash;by their wild demeanor, and a ferocity that made his
heart quake. &ldquo;Your cousin,&rdquo; said he,&mdash;&ldquo;your cousin, whom, by the way,
I only saw for a few minutes, seemed admirably adapted to the exigencies
of the social state around her; and although ball practice has not been
included amongst the ordinary items of young ladies&rsquo; acquirements, I am
satisfied that it might advantageously form part of an Irish education.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;As to your offer of a seat in Parliament, I can only say,&rdquo; continued he,
&ldquo;that as the Member of Oughterard I should always feel as though I were
seated over a barrel of gunpowder; while the very idea of meeting my
constituency makes me shudder. I am, however, quite sensible of the honor
intended me, both upon that score and in your proposal of my taking up my
residence at Cro&rsquo; Martin. The social elevation, and so forth, to ensue
from such a course of proceeding would have this disadvantage,&mdash;it
would not pay! No, Captain Martin, the settlement between us must stand
upon another basis,&mdash;the very simple and matter-of-fact one called £
s. d. I shall leave this to-morrow, and be in town, I hope, by Wednesday;
you can, therefore, give your man of business, Mr. Saunders, his
instructions to meet me at Wimpole&rsquo;s, and state what terms of liquidation
he is prepared to offer. Suffice it for the present to say that I decline
any arrangement which should transfer to me any portion of the estate. I
declare to you, frankly, I&rsquo;d not accept the whole of it on the condition
of retaining the proprietorship.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
When Mr. Merl had just penned the last sentence, the door slowly and
cautiously was opened behind him, and a very much carbuncled face
protruded into the room. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s himself,&rdquo; muttered a voice; and ere
Merl had been able to detect the speaker, the door was closed. These
casual interruptions to his privacy had so frequently occurred since the
commencement of his tour, that he only included them amongst his other
Irish &ldquo;disagreeables;&rdquo; and so he was preparing to enter on another
paragraph, when a very decisive knock at the door startled him, and before
he could say &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; a tall, red-faced, vulgar-looking man, somewhat
stooped in the shoulders, and with that blear-eyed watery expression so
distinctive in hard drinkers, slowly entered, and shutting the door behind
him, advanced to the fire.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My name, sir, is Brierley,&rdquo; said he, with a full, rich brogue.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Brierley&mdash;Brierley&mdash;never heard of Brierley before,&rdquo; said Mr.
Merl, affecting a flippant ease that was very remote from his heart.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Better late than never, sir,&rdquo; rejoined the other, coolly seating himself,
and crossing his arms on his breast. &ldquo;I have come here on the part of my
friend Tom,&mdash;Mr. Magennis, I mean,&mdash;of Barnagheela, who told me
to track you out.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Much obliged, I&rsquo;m sure, for the attention,&rdquo; said Merl, with an assumed
smartness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That &lsquo;s all right; so you should,&rdquo; continued Brierley. &ldquo;Tom told me that
you were present at Cro&rsquo; Martin when he was outraged and insulted,&mdash;by
a female of course, or he wouldn&rsquo;t be making a complaint of it now,&mdash;and
as he is not the man that ever lay under a thing of the kind, or ever
will, he sent me here to you, to arrange where you &lsquo;d like to have it, and
when.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To have what?&rdquo; asked Merl, with a look of unfeigned terror.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Baythershin! how dull we are!&rdquo; said Mr. Brierley, with a finger to his
very red nose. &ldquo;Sure it&rsquo;s not thinking of the King&rsquo;s Bench you are, that
you want me to speak clearer.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I want to know your meaning, sir,&mdash;if you have a meaning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Be cool, honey; keep yourself cool. Without you happen to find that
warmth raises your heart, I &lsquo;d say again, be cool. I&rsquo;ve one simple
question to ask you,&rdquo;&mdash;here he dropped his voice to a low, cautious
whisper,&mdash;&ldquo;Will ye blaze?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will I what?&rdquo; cried Merl.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Brierley arose, and drawing himself up to his full height, extended
his arm in the attitude of one taking aim with a pistol. &ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; cried he,
&ldquo;you comprehend me now, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Fight&mdash;fight a duel!&rdquo; exclaimed Merl, aloud.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Whisht! whisht! speak lower,&rdquo; said Brierley; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s maybe a chap
listening at the door this minute!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Accepting the intimation in a very different spirit from that in which it
was offered, Merl rushed to the door, and threw it wide open. &ldquo;Waiter!&mdash;landlord!&mdash;house!&mdash;waiter!&rdquo;
 screamed he, at the top of his voice. And in an instant three or four
slovenly-looking fellows, with dirty napkins in dirtier hands, surrounded
him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What is it, your honer?&mdash;what is it?&rdquo; asked they, in a breath.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear what the gentleman&rsquo;s asking for?&rdquo; said Brierley, with a
half-serious face. &ldquo;He wants a chaise-to the door as quick as lightning.
He &lsquo;s off this minute.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, by Jupiter! that I am,&rdquo; said Merl, wiping the perspiration from his
forehead.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Take your last look at the West, dear, as you pass the Shannon, for I
don&rsquo;t think you &lsquo;ll ever come so far again,&rdquo; said Brierley, with a grin,
as he moved by him to descend the stairs.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I do, may&mdash;&rdquo; But the slam of his room-door, and the rattle of the
key as he locked it, cut short Mr. Merl&rsquo;s denunciation.
</p>
<p>
In less than half an hour afterwards a yellow post-chaise left the &ldquo;Martin
Arms&rdquo; at full speed, a wild yell of insult and derision greeting it as it
swept by, showing how the Oughterard public appreciated its inmate!

<h2>
CHAPTER XX. SOMETHING NOT EXACTLY FLIRTATION.
</h2>
<p>
Most travelled reader, have you ever stood upon the plateau at the foot of
the Alten-Schloss in Baden, just before sunset, and seen the golden glory
spread out like a sheen over the vast plain beneath you, with waving
forests, the meandering Rhine, and the blue Vosges mountains beyond all?
It is a noble landscape, where every feature is bold, and throughout which
light and shade alternate in broad, effective masses, showing that you are
gazing on a scene of great extent, and taking in miles of country with
your eye. It is essentially German, too, in its characteristics. The
swelling undulations of the soil, the deep, dark forests, the picturesque
homesteads, with shadowy eaves and carved quaint balconies, the great
gigantic wagons slowly toiling through the narrow lanes, over which the
&ldquo;Lindens&rdquo; spread a leafy canopy,&mdash;all are of the Vaterland.
</p>
<p>
Some fancied resemblance&mdash;it was in reality no more&mdash;to a view
from a window at Cro&rsquo; Martin had especially endeared this spot to Martin,
who regularly was carried up each evening to pass an hour or so, dreaming
away in that half-unconsciousness to which his malady had reduced him.
There he sat, scarcely a remnant of his former self, a leaden dulness in
his eye, and a massive immobility in the features which once were plastic
with every passing mood that stirred him. The clasped hands and slightly
bent-down head gave a character of patient, unresisting meaning to his
figure, which the few words he dropped from time to time seemed to
confirm.
</p>
<p>
At a little distance off, and on the very verge of the cliff, Kate
Henderson was seated sketching; and behind her, occasionally turning to
walk up and down the terraced space, was Massingbred, once more in full
health, and bearing in appearance the signs of his old, impatient humor.
Throwing away his half-smoked cigar, and with a face whose expression
betokened the very opposite of all calm and ease of mind, he drew nigh to
where she sat, and watched her over her shoulder. For a while she worked
away without noticing his presence. At last she turned slightly about, and
looking up at him, said, &ldquo;You see, it&rsquo;s very nearly finished.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0010" id="linkimage-0010">
<!-- IMG --></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/232.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /><br />
</div>
<p>
alt="232 &ldquo;>
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, and what then?&rdquo; asked he, bluntly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you forget that I gave you until that time to change your opinion?
that when I was shadowing in this foreground I said, &lsquo;Wait &lsquo;till I have
done this sketch, and see if you be of the same mind,&rsquo; and you agreed?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This might be very pleasant trifling if nothing were at stake, Miss
Henderson,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but remember that I cannot hold all my worldly
chances as cheaply as <i>you</i> seem to do them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Light another cigar, and sit down here beside me,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t dislike
smoke, and it may, perchance, be a peace calumet between us; and let us
talk, if possible, reasonably and calmly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He obeyed like one who seemed to feel that her word was a command, and sat
down on the cliff at her side.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There, now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;be useful; hold that color-case for me, and give
me your most critical counsel. Do you like my sketch?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very much indeed.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where do you find fault with it? There must be a fault, or your criticism
is worth nothing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Its greatest blemish in my eyes is the time it has occupied you. Since
you began it you have very rarely condescended to speak of anything else.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A most unjust speech, and an ungrateful one. It was when throwing in
those trees yonder, I persuaded you to recall your farewell address to
your borough friends; it was the same day that I sketched that figure
there, that I showed you the great mistake of your present life. There is
no greater error, believe me, than supposing that a Parliamentary success,
like a social one, can be achieved by mere brilliancy. Party is an army,
and you must serve in the ranks before you can wear your epaulets.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have told you already,&mdash;I tell you again,&mdash;I &lsquo;m tired of the
theme that has myself alone for its object.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of whom would you speak, then?&rdquo; said she, still intently busied with her
drawing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You ask me when you know well of whom,&rdquo; said he, hurriedly. &ldquo;Nay, no
menaces; I could not if I would be silent. It is impossible for me any
longer to continue this struggle with myself. Here now, before I leave
this spot, you shall answer me&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped suddenly, as though he
had said more than he intended, or more than he well knew how to continue.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said she, calmly. And her fingers never trembled as they held the
brush.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I confess I do envy that tranquil spirit of yours,&rdquo; said he, bitterly.
&ldquo;It is such a triumph to be calm, cold, and impassive at a moment when
others feel their reason tottering and their brain a chaos.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is nothing so easy, sir,&rdquo; said she, proudly. &ldquo;All that I can boast
of is not to have indulged in illusions which seem to have a charm for <i>you</i>.
You say you want explicit-ness. You shall have it. There was one condition
on which I offered you my friendship and my advice. You accepted the
bargain, and we were friends. After a while you came and said that you
rued your compact; that you discovered your feelings for me went further;
that mere friendship, as you phrased it, would not suffice&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I told you, rather,&rdquo; broke he in, &ldquo;that I wished to put that feeling to
the last test, by linking your fortune with my own forever.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very well, I accept that version. You offered to make me your wife, and
in return, I asked you to retract your words,&mdash;to suffer our
relations to continue on their old footing, nor subject me to the
necessity of an explanation painful to both of us. For a while you
consented; now you seem impatient at your concession, and ask me to resume
the subject. Be it so, but for the last time.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Massingbred&rsquo;s cheeks grew deadly pale, but he never uttered a word.
</p>
<p>
After a second&rsquo;s pause, she resumed: &ldquo;Your affections are less engaged in
this case than you think. You would make me your wife just as you would do
anything else that gave a bold defiance to the world, to show a
consciousness of your own power, to break down any obstacle, and make the
prejudices or opinions of society give way before you. You have energy and
self-esteem enough to make this succeed. Your wife&mdash;albeit the
steward&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;the governess! would be received, invited,
visited, and the rest of it; and so far as <i>you</i> were concerned the
triumph would be complete. Now, however, turn a little attention to the
other side of the medal. What is to requite <i>me</i> for all this
courtesy on sufferance, all this mockery of consideration? Where am I to
find my friendships, where even discover my duties? You only know of one
kind of pride, that of station and social eminence. I can tell you there
is another, loftier far,&mdash;the consciousness that no inequality of
position can obliterate, what I feel and know in myself of superiority to
those fine ladies whose favorable notice you would entreat for me. Smile
at the vanity of this declaration if you like, sir, but, at least, own
that I am consistent; for I am prouder in the independence of my present
dependence than I should be in all the state of Mr. Massingbred&rsquo;s wife.
You can see, therefore, that I could not accept this change as the great
elevation you would deem it. You would be stooping to raise one who could
never persuade herself that she was exalted. I am well aware that
inequality of one sort or another is the condition of most marriages. The
rank of one compensates for the wealth of the other. Here it is affluence
and age, there it is beauty and poverty. People treat the question in a
good commercial spirit, and balance the profit and loss like tradesfolk;
but even in this sense our compact would be impossible, since <i>you</i>
would endow me with what has no value in my eyes, and <i>I</i>, worse off
still, have absolutely nothing to give in return.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Give me your love, dearest Kate,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;and, supported by that, you
shall see that I deserve it. Believe me, it is your own proud spirit that
exaggerates the difficulties that would await us in society.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should scorn myself if I thought of them,&rdquo; broke she in, haughtily;
&ldquo;and remember, sir, these are not the words of one who speaks in
ignorance. I, too, have seen that great world, on which your affections
are so fixed. I have mixed with it, and know it. Notwithstanding all the
cant of moralists, I do not believe it to be more hollow or more heartless
than other classes. Its great besetting sin is not of self-growth, for it
comes of the slavish adulation offered by those beneath it,&mdash;the
grovelling worship of the would-be fine folk, who would leave friends and
home and hearth to be admitted even to the antechambers of the great. They
who offer up this incense are in my eyes far more despicable than they who
accept the sacrifice; but I would not cast my lot with either. Do not
smile, sir, as if these were high-flown sentiments; they are the veriest
commonplaces of one who loves commonplace, who neither seeks affections
with coronets nor friendships in gold coaches, but who would still less be
of that herd&mdash;mute, astonished, and awe-struck&mdash;who worship
them!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You deem me, then, deficient in this same independence of spirit?&rdquo; cried
Massingbred, half indignantly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I certainly do not accept your intention of marrying beneath you as a
proof of it. Must I again tell you, sir, that in such cases it is the
poor, weak, patient, forgotten woman pays all the penalty, and that, in
the very conflict with the world the man has his reward?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you loved me, Kate,&rdquo; said he, in a tone of deep sorrow, &ldquo;it is not
thus you would discuss this question.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She made no reply, but bending down lower over her drawing, worked away
with increased rapidity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; cried he, passionately, &ldquo;I am not to be deterred by a defeat.
Tell me, at least, how I can win that love, which is to me the great prize
of life. You read my faults, you see my shortcomings clearly enough; be
equally just, then, to anything there is of good or hopeful about me. Do
this, Kate, and I will put my fate upon the issue.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;In plain words,&rdquo; said she, calmly, &ldquo;you ask me what manner of man I would
consent to marry. I &lsquo;ll tell you. One who with ability enough to attain
any station, and talents to gain any eminence, has lived satisfied with
that in which he was born; one who has made the independence of his
character so felt by the world that his actions have been regarded as
standards, a man of honor and of his word; employing his knowledge of
life, not for the purposes of overreaching, but for self-correction and
improvement; well bred enough to be a peer, simple as a peasant; such a
man, in fact, as could afford to marry a governess, and, while elevating
her to his station, never compromise his own with his equals. I don&rsquo;t
flatter myself,&rdquo; said she, smiling, &ldquo;that I &lsquo;m likely to draw this prize;
but I console myself by thinking that I could not accept aught beneath it
as great fortune. I see, sir, the humility of my pretensions amuses you,
and it is all the better for both of us if we can treat these things
jestingly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nay, Kate, you are unfair&mdash;unjust,&rdquo; broke in Mas-singbred.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Martin begins to feel it chilly, Miss Henderson,&rdquo; said a servant at
this moment. &ldquo;Shall we return to the hotel?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, by all means,&rdquo; said she, rising hastily. The next instant she was
busily engaged shawling and muffling the sick man, who accepted her
attentions with the submissive-ness of a child.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That will do, Molly, thank you, darling,&rdquo; said he, in a feeble voice;
&ldquo;you are so kind, so good to me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The evening is fresh, sir, almost cold,&rdquo; said she.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, dear, the climate is not what it used to be. We have cut down too
many of those trees, Molly, yonder.&rdquo; And he pointed with his thin fingers
towards the Rhine. &ldquo;We have thinned the wood overmuch, but they&rsquo;ll grow
again, dear, though I shall not be here to see them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He thinks I am his niece,&rdquo; whispered Kate, &ldquo;and fancies himself at Cro&rsquo;
Martin.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose they&rsquo;ll advise my trying a warm country, Molly, a milder air,&rdquo;
 muttered he, as they slowly carried him along. &ldquo;But home, after all, is
home; one likes to see the old faces and the old objects around them,&mdash;all
the more when about to leave them forever!&rdquo; And as the last words came,
two heavy tears stole slowly along his cheeks, and his pale lips quivered
with emotion. Now speaking in a low, weak voice to himself, now sighing
heavily, as though in deep depression, he was borne along towards the
hotel. Nor did the gay and noisy groups which thronged the thoroughfares
arouse him. He saw them, but seemed not to heed them. His dreary gaze
wandered over the brilliant panorama without interest or speculation. Some
painful and difficult thoughts, perhaps, did all these unaccustomed sights
and sounds bring across his mind, embarrassing him to reconcile their
presence with the scene he fancied himself beholding; but even these
impressions were faint and fleeting.
</p>
<p>
As they turned to cross the little rustic bridge in front of the hotel, a
knot of persons moved off the path to make way for them, one of whom fixed
his eyes steadily on the sick man, gazing with the keen scrutiny of
intense interest; then suddenly recalling himself to recollection, he
hastily retreated within the group.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; muttered he to one near him, &ldquo;he <i>is</i> &lsquo;booked;&rsquo; my
bond will come due before the month ends.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll be an estated gent, Herman, eh?&rdquo; said a very dark-eyed,
hook-nosed man at his side.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I hope I shall act the part as well as my neighbors,&rdquo; said Mr.
Merl, with that mingled assurance and humility that made up his manner.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Was n&rsquo;t that Massingbred that followed them,&mdash;he that made the
famous speech the other day in Parliament?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Merl. &ldquo;I &lsquo;ve got a bit of &lsquo;stiff&rsquo; with his endorsement in my
pocket this minute for one hundred and fifty.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it worth, Merl?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps ten shillings; but I &lsquo;d not part with it quite so cheaply. He&rsquo;ll
not always be an M.P., and we shall see if he can afford to swagger by an
old acquaintance without so much as a &lsquo;How d&rsquo; ye do?&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There, he is coming back again,&rdquo; said the other. And at the same moment
Massingbred walked slowly up to the spot, his easy smile upon his face,
and his whole expression that of a careless, unburdened nature.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I just caught a glimpse of you as I passed, Merl,&rdquo; said he, with a
familiar nod; &ldquo;and you were exactly the man I wanted to see.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Too much honor, sir,&rdquo; said Merl, affecting a degree of haughty distance
at the familiarity of this address.
</p>
<p>
Massingbred smiled at the mock dignity, and went on; &ldquo;I have something to
say to you. Will you give me a call this evening at the Cour de Bade, say
about nine or half-past?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have an engagement this evening.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Put it off, then, that&rsquo;s all, Master Merl, for mine is an important
matter, and very nearly concerns yourself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Merl was silent. He would have liked much to display before his friends a
little of the easy dash and swagger that he had just been exhibiting, to
have shown them how cavalierly he could treat a rising statesman and a
young Parliamentary star of the first order; but the question crossed him,
Was it safe? what might the luxury cost him? &ldquo;Am I to bring that little
acceptance of yours along with me?&rdquo; said he, in a half whisper, while a
malicious sparkle twinkled in his eye.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why not, man? Certainly, if it gives you the least pleasure in life; only
don&rsquo;t be later than half-past nine.&rdquo; And with one of his sauciest laughs
Massingbred moved away, leaving the Jew very far from content with &ldquo;the
situation.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Merl, however, soon rallied. He had been amusing his friends, just before
this interruption, with a narrative of his Irish journey: he now resumed
the theme. All that he found faulty, all even that he deemed new or
strange or unintelligible in that unhappy country, he had dressed up in
the charming colors of his cockney vocabulary, and his hearers were worthy
of him! There is but little temptation, however, to linger in their
company, and so we leave them.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXI. LADY DOROTHEA
</h2>
<p>
The Cour de Bade, at which excellent hotel the Martins were installed,
received on the day we have just chronicled a new arrival. He had come by
the diligence, one of that undistinguishable ten thousand England sends
off every week from her shores to represent her virtues or her vices, her
oddities, vulgarities, and pretensions, to the critical eyes of
continental Europe.
</p>
<p>
Perfectly innocent of any foreign language, and with a delightful
ambiguity as to the precise geography of where he stood, he succeeded,
after some few failures, in finding out where the Martins stopped, and had
now sent up his name to Lady Dorothea, that name being &ldquo;Mr. Maurice
Scanlan.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lady Dorothea Martin had given positive orders that except in the
particular case of this individual she was not to be interrupted by any
visitor. She glanced her eye at the card, and then handed it across the
table to her son, who coolly read it, and threw it from him with the air
of one saying to himself, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s more of it! more complication, more
investigation, deeper research into my miserable difficulties, and
consequently more unhappiness.&rdquo; The table at which they were seated was
thickly covered with parchments, papers, documents, and letters of every
shape and size. There were deeds, and bonds, and leases, rent-rolls, and
valuations, and powers of attorney, and all the other imposing accessories
of estated property. There were also voluminous bills of costs, formidable
long columns of figures, &ldquo;carried over&rdquo; and &ldquo;carried over&rdquo; till the very
eye of the reader wearied of the dread numerals and turned recklessly to
meet the awful total at the bottom! Terrified by the menacing applications
addressed to Mr. Martin on his son&rsquo;s account, and which arrived by every
post, Lady Dorothea had resolved upon herself entering upon the whole
state of the Captain&rsquo;s liabilities, as well as the complicated questions
of the property generally.
</p>
<p>
Distrust of her own powers was not in the number of her Ladyship&rsquo;s
defects. Sufficiently affluent to be always able to surround herself with
competent subordinates, she fancied&mdash;a not very uncommon error, by
the way&mdash;that she individually accomplished all that she had obtained
through another. Her taste in the fine arts, her skill in music, her
excellence as a letter-writer, were all accomplishments in this wise; and
it is not improbable that, had she been satisfied to accept her success in
finance through a similar channel, the result might have proved just as
fortunate. A shrinking dislike, however, to expose the moneyed
circumstances of the family, and a feeling of dread as to the possible
disclosures which should come out, prevented her from accepting such
co-operation. She had, therefore, addressed herself to the task with no
other aid than that of her son,&mdash;a partnership, it must be owned,
which relieved her very little of her burden.
</p>
<p>
Had the Captain been called away from the pleasures and amusements of life
to investigate the dry records of some far-away cousin&rsquo;s embarrassments,&mdash;to
dive into the wearisome narrative of money-borrowing, bill-renewing, and
the rest of it, by one whom he had scarcely known or seen,&mdash;his
manner and bearing could not possibly have betrayed stronger signs of
utter weariness and apathy than he now exhibited. Smoking his cigar, and
trimming his nails with a very magnificent penknife, he gave short and
listless replies to her Ladyship&rsquo;s queries, and did but glance at the
papers which from time to time she handed to him for explanation or
inquiry.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So he is come at last!&rdquo; exclaimed she, as the Captain threw down the
visiting-card. &ldquo;Shall we see him at once?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;By Jove! I think we&rsquo;ve had enough of &lsquo;business,&rsquo; as they call it, for one
morning,&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Here have we been since a little after eleven, and it
is now four, and I am as sick of accounts and figures as though I were a
Treasury clerk.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We have done next to nothing, after all!&rdquo; said she, peevishly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I told you as much when you began,&rdquo; said he, lighting a fresh cigar.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no seeing one&rsquo;s way through these kind of things after the lapse
of a year or two. Fordyce gets hold of the bills you gave Mossop, and
Rawkins buys up some of the things you had given renewals for, and then
all that trash you took in part payment of your acceptances turns up, some
day or other, to be paid for; and what between the bills that never were
to be negotiated&mdash;but somehow do get abroad&mdash;and the sums sent
to meet others applied in quite a different direction, I&rsquo;ll lay eighty to
fifty in tens or ponies there&rsquo;s no gentleman living ever mastered one of
these embarrassments. One must be bred to it, my Lady, take my word for
it. It&rsquo;s like being a crack rider or a poet,&mdash;it&rsquo;s born with a man.
‘The Henderson,&rsquo;&rdquo; added he, after a pause, &ldquo;she can do it, and I should
like to see what she couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am curious to learn how you became acquainted with these financial
abilities of Miss Henderson?&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea, haughtily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Simply enough. I was poring over these confounded accounts one day at
Manheim, and I chanced to ask her a question,&mdash;something about
compound interest, I think it was,&mdash;and so she came and looked over
what I was doing, or rather endeavoring to do. It was that affair with
Throgmorton, where I was to meet one third of the bills, and Merl and he
were to look to the remainder; but there was a reservation that if Comus
won the Oaks, I was to stand free&mdash;no, that&rsquo;s not it&mdash;if Comus
won the double event&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never mind your stupid contract. What of Miss Henderson?&rdquo; broke in Lady
Dorothea.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, she came over, as I told you, and took up a pencil and began
working away with all sorts of signs and crosses,&mdash;regular algebra,
by Jove!&mdash;and in about five minutes out came the whole thing, all
square, showing that I stood to win on either event, and came off
splendidly if the double should turn up. &lsquo;I wish,&rsquo; said I to her, &lsquo;you &lsquo;d
just run your eye over my book and see how I stand.&rsquo; She took it over to
the fire, and before I could well believe she had glanced at it, she said:
‘This is all full of blunders. You have left yourself open to three
casualties, any one of which will sweep away all your winnings. Take the
odds on Roehampton, and lay on Slingsby a couple of hundred more,&mdash;three,
if you can get it,&mdash;and you &lsquo;ll be safe enough. And when you &lsquo;ve done
that,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I have another piece of counsel to give; but first say
will you take it?&rsquo; &lsquo;I give you my word upon it,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;Then it is
this,&rsquo; said she: &lsquo;make no more wagers on the turf. You haven&rsquo;t skill to
make what is called a &ldquo;good book,&rdquo; and you &lsquo;ll always be a sufferer.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did n&rsquo;t she vouchsafe to offer you her admirable assistance?&rdquo; asked her
Ladyship, with a sneer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, by Jove!&rdquo; said he, not noticing the tone of sarcasm; &ldquo;and when I
asked her, &lsquo;Would not she afford me a little aid?&rsquo; she quickly said, &lsquo;Not
on any account. You are now in a difficulty, and I willingly come forward
to extricate you. Far different were the case should I conspire with you
to place others in a similar predicament. Besides, I have your pledge that
you have now done with these transactions, and forever.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What an admirable monitor! One only wonders how so much morality coexists
with such very intimate knowledge of ignoble pursuits.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;By Jove! she knows everything,&rdquo; broke in the Captain. &ldquo;Such a canter as
she gave me t&rsquo; other morning about idleness and the rest of it, saying how
I ought to study Hindostanee, and get a staff appointment, and so on,&mdash;that
every one ought to place himself above the accidents of fortune; and when
I said something about having no opportunity at hand, she replied, &lsquo;Never
complain of that; begin with <i>me</i>. I know quite enough to initiate
you; and as to Sanscrit, I &lsquo;m rather &ldquo;up&rdquo; in it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I trust you accepted the offer?&rdquo; said her Ladyship, with an ambiguous
smile.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t say I did. I hate work,&mdash;at least that kind of work.
Besides, one doesn&rsquo;t like to come out &lsquo;stupid&rsquo; in these kind of things,
and so I merely said, &lsquo;I &lsquo;d think of it&mdash;very kind of her,&rsquo; and so
on.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did it never occur to you all this while,&rdquo; began her Ladyship; and then
suddenly correcting herself, she stopped short, and said, &ldquo;By the way, Mr.
Scanlan is waiting for his answer. Ring the bell, and let him come in.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Perhaps it was the imperfect recollection of that eminent individual,&mdash;perhaps
the altered circumstances in which she now saw him, and possibly some
actual changes in the man himself,&mdash;but really Lady Dorothea almost
started with surprise as he entered the room, dressed in a dark pelisse,
richly braided and frogged, an embroidered travelling-cap in his hand, and
an incipient moustache on his upper lip,&mdash;all evidencing how rapidly
he had turned his foreign experiences to advantage. There was, too, in his
address a certain confident assurance that told how quickly the habits of
the &ldquo;Table d&rsquo;hôte&rdquo; had impressed him, and how instantaneously his nature
had imbibed the vulgar ease of the &ldquo;Continent.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have just arrived, Mr. Scanlan?&rdquo; said her Ladyship, haughtily, and
not a little provoked at the shake-hand salutation her son had accorded
him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lady, this instant, and such a journey as we &lsquo;ve had! No water on
the Rhine for the steamers; and then, when we took to the land, a perfect
deluge of rain, that nearly swept us away. At Eisleben, or some such name,
we had an upset.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What day did you leave Ireland?&rdquo; asked she, in utter indifference as to
the casualty.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tuesday fortnight last, my Lady. I was detained two days in Dublin making
searches&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you brought us any letters, sir?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;One from Miss Mary, my Lady, and another from Mr. Repton&mdash;very
pressing he said it was. I hope Mr. Martin is better? Your Ladyship&rsquo;s last&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not much improvement,&rdquo; said she, stiffly, while her thin lips were
compressed with an expression that might mean pride or sorrow, or both.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And the country, sir? How did you leave it looking?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pretty well, my Lady. More frightened than hurt, as a body might say.
They &lsquo;ve had a severe winter, and a great deal of sickness; the rains,
too, have done a deal of mischief; but on the whole matters are looking up
again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will the rents be paid, sir?&rdquo; asked she, sharply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, I hope so, my Lady. Some, of course, will be backward, and beg
for time, and a few more will take advantage of Magennis&rsquo;s success, and
strive to fight us off.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There must have been some gross mismanagement in that business, sir,&rdquo;
 broke in her Ladyship. &ldquo;Had I been at home, I promise you the matter would
have ended differently.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Repton directed all the proceedings himself, my Lady. He conferred
with Miss Mary.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What could a young lady know about such matters?&rdquo; said she, angrily. &ldquo;Any
prospect of a tenant for the house, sir?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If your Ladyship really decides on not going back&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not the slightest intention of doing so, sir. If it depended upon me, I&rsquo;d
rather pull it down and sell the materials than return to live there. You
know yourself, sir, the utter barbarism we were obliged to submit to. No
intercourse with the world&mdash;no society&mdash;very frequently no
communication by post. Surrounded by a set of ragged creatures, all
importunity and idleness, at one moment all defiance and insolence, at the
next crawling and abject. But it is really a theme I cannot dwell upon.
Give me your letters, sir, and let me see you this evening.&rdquo; And taking
the papers from his hand, she swept out of the room in a haughty state.
</p>
<p>
The Captain and Mr. Scanlan exchanged looks, and were silent, but their
glances were far more intelligible than aught either of them would have
ventured to say aloud; and when the attorney&rsquo;s eyes, having followed her
Ladyship to the door, turned and rested on the Captain, the other gave a
brief short nod of assent, as though to say, &ldquo;Yes, you are right; she&rsquo;s
just the same as ever.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And <i>you</i>, Captain,&rdquo; said Scanlan, in his tone of natural
familiarity,&mdash;&ldquo;how is the world treating <i>you?</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Devilish badly, Master Scanlan.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, what is it doing, then?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it&rsquo;s doing! It&rsquo;s charging me fifty&mdash;ay, sixty per
cent; it&rsquo;s protesting my bills, stimulating my blessed creditors to
proceed against me, worrying my very life out of me with letters. Letters
to the governor, letters to the Horse Guards, and, last of all, it has
just lamed Bonesetter, the horse &lsquo;I stood to win&rsquo; on for the Chester Cup,
I would n&rsquo;t have taken four thousand for my book yesterday morning!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bad news all this.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; said he, lighting a cigar, and throwing another across
the table to Scanlan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just bad news, and I have nothing else for
many a long day past. A fellow of your sort, Master Maurice, punting away
at county races and small sweepstakes, has a precious deal better time of
it than a captain of the King&rsquo;s Hussars with his head and shoulders in the
Fleet.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, come, who knows but luck will turn, Captain? Make a book on the
Oaks.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it; and I&rsquo;m in for it, too,&rdquo; said the other, savagely.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Raise a few thousands, you can always sell a reversion.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have done that also,&rdquo; said he, still more angrily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;With your position and advantages you could always marry well. If you&rsquo;d
just beat up the manufacturing districts, you&rsquo;d get your eighty thousand
as sure as I&rsquo;m here! And then matrimony admits of a man&rsquo;s changing all his
habits. He can sell off hunters, get rid of a racing stable, and twenty
other little embarrassments, and only gain character by the economy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a brass farthing for that part of the matter, Scanlan. No
man shall dictate to me how I &lsquo;m to spend my money. Do you just find me
the tin, and I &lsquo;ll find the talent to scatter it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If it can&rsquo;t be done by a post-obit&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I tell you, sir,&rdquo; cried Martin, peevishly, &ldquo;as I have told you before,
that has been done. There is such a thing as pumping a well dry, is n&rsquo;t
there?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Scanlan made a sudden exclamation of horror; and after a pause, said,
&ldquo;Already!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, sir, already!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I had my suspicions about it,&rdquo; muttered Scanlan, gloomily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You had? And how so, may I beg to ask?&rdquo; said Martin, angrily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I saw him down there, myself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Saw whom? Whom are you talking of?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of that Jew, of course. Mr. Merl, he calls himself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A faint groan was all Martin&rsquo;s reply, as he turned away to hide his face.
</p>
<p>
Scanlan watched him for a minute or so, and then resumed: &ldquo;I guessed at
once what he was at; <i>he</i> never deceived me, talking about snipe and
woodcocks, and pretending to care about hare-hunting. I saw my man at a
glance. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not sporting ever brought you down to these parts,&rsquo; said I.
‘<i>Your</i> game is young fellows, hard up for cash, willing to give up
their birthright for a few thousands down, and never giving a second
thought whether they paid twenty per cent, or a hundred and twenty.&rsquo; Well,
well, Captain, you ought to have told me all about it. There wasn&rsquo;t a man
in Ireland could have putted you through like myself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; cried Martin, hurriedly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sure, when he was down in the West, what was easier? Faix, if I had only
had the wind of a word that matters were so bad, I &lsquo;d have had the papers
out of him long ago. You shake your head as if you did n&rsquo;t believe me; but
take my word for it, I &lsquo;m right, sir. I &lsquo;d put a quarrel on him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;d</i> not fight you!&rdquo; said Martin, turning away in disappointment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe he wouldn&rsquo;t; but mightn&rsquo;t he be robbed? Couldn&rsquo;t he be waylaid, and
carried off to the Islands? There was no need to kill him. Intimidation
would do it all! I&rsquo;d lay my head upon a block this minute if I would n&rsquo;t
send him back to London without the back of a letter in his company; and
what&rsquo;s more, a pledge that he &lsquo;d never tell what&rsquo;s happened to him!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;These cockney gents are more &lsquo;wide awake&rsquo; than you suspect, Master
Maurice, and the chances are that he never carried a single paper or
parchment along with him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Worse for him, then,&rdquo; said Scanlan. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d have to pass the rest of his
days in the Arran Islands. But I&rsquo;m not so sure he&rsquo;s as &lsquo;cute as you think
him,&rdquo; added Maurice, after a pause. &ldquo;He left a little note-book once
behind him that told some strange stories, by all accounts.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What was that you speak of?&rdquo; cried Martin, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t see it myself, but Simmy Crow told me of it; and that it was
full of all the fellows he ruined,&mdash;how much he won from this man,
what he carried off from that; and, moreover, there was your own name, and
the date of the very evening that he finished you off! It was something in
this wise: &lsquo;This night&rsquo;s work makes me an estated gentleman, <i>vice</i>
Harry Martin, Esquire, retired upon less than half-pay!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A terrible oath, uttered in all the vehemence of a malediction, burst from
Martin, and seizing Scanlan&rsquo;s wrist, he shook his arm in an agony of
passion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish I had given you a hint about him, Master Scanlan,&rdquo; said he,
savagely.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to think of it now, Captain,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;the fellow
is in Baden.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here?&rdquo; asked Martin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay. He came up the Rhine along with me; but he never recognized me,&mdash;on
account of my moustaches perhaps,&mdash;he took me for a Frenchman or a
German, I think. We parted at Mayence, and I saw no more of him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I would that I was to see no more of him!&rdquo; said Martin, gloomily, as he
walked into another room, banging the door heavily behind him.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXII. HOW PRIDE MEETS PRIDE
</h2>
<p>
Kate Henderson sat alone in her room reading a letter from her father, her
thoughtful brow a shade more serious perhaps than its wont, and at times a
faint, half-sickly smile moving her dimpled cheek. The interests of our
story have no concern with that letter, save passingly, nor do we regret
it. Enough, if we say it was in reply to one of her own, requesting
permission to return home, until, as she phrased it, she could &ldquo;obtain
another service.&rdquo; That the request had met scant favor was easy to see,
as, folding up the letter, she laid it down beside her with a sigh and a
muttered &ldquo;I thought as much!&mdash;&lsquo;So long as her Ladyship is pleased to
accept of your services,&rsquo;&rdquo; said she, repeating aloud an expression of the
writer. &ldquo;Well, I suppose he&rsquo;s right; such is the true reading of the
compact, as it is of every compact where there is wealth on one side,
dependence on the other! Nor should I complain,&rdquo; said she, still more
resolutely, &ldquo;if these same services could be rendered toilfully, but
costing nothing of self-sacrifice in honorable feeling. I could be a
drudge&mdash;a slave&mdash;to-morrow; I could stoop to any labor; but I
cannot&mdash;no, I cannot&mdash;descend to companionship! They who hire
us,&rdquo; cried she, rising, and pacing the room in slow and measured tread,
&ldquo;have a right to our capacity. We are here to do their bidding; but they
can lay no claim to that over which we ourselves have no control&mdash;our
sympathies, our affections&mdash;we cannot sell these; we cannot always
give them, even as a gift.&rdquo; She paused, and opening the letter, read it
for some seconds, and then flinging it down with a haughty gesture, said,
&ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing menial&mdash;nothing to complain of in my station!&rsquo; Can he not
see that there is no such servitude as that which drags out existence, by
subjecting, not head and hands, but heart and soul, to the dictates of
another? The menial&mdash;the menial has the best of it. Some stipulate
that they are not to wear a livery; but what livery exacts such
degradation as this?&rdquo; And she shook the rich folds of her heavy silk dress
as she spoke. The tears rose up and dimmed her eyes, but they were tears
of offended pride, and as they stole slowly along her cheeks, her features
acquired an expression of intense haughtiness. &ldquo;They who train their
children to this career are but sorry calculators!&mdash;educating them
but to feel the bitter smart of their station, to see more clearly the
wide gulf that separates them from what they live amongst!&rdquo; said she, in a
voice of deep emotion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Her Ladyship, Miss Henderson,&rdquo; said a servant, throwing wide the door,
and closing it after the entrance of Lady Dorothea, who swept into the
room in her haughtiest of moods, and seated herself with all that
preparation that betokened a visit of importance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Take a seat, Miss Henderson,&rdquo; said she. And Kate obeyed in silence. &ldquo;If
in the course of what I shall have to say to you,&rdquo; resumed her Ladyship,&mdash;&ldquo;if
in what I shall feel it my <i>duty</i> to say to you, I may be betrayed
into any expression stronger than in a calmer moment would occur to me,&mdash;stronger
in fact, than strict justice might warrant&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I beg your Ladyship&rsquo;s pardon if I interrupt, but I would beg to remark&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea, proudly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That simply your Ladyship&rsquo;s present caution is the best security for
future propriety. I ask no other.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You presume too far, young lady. I cannot answer that <i>my</i> temper
may not reveal sentiments that my judgment or my breeding might prefer to
keep in abeyance.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If the sentiments be there, my Lady, I should certainly say, better to
avow them,&rdquo; said Kate, with an air of most impassive coldness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;m not aware that I have asked your advice on that head, Miss
Henderson,&rdquo; said she, almost insolently. &ldquo;At the same time, your habits of
late in this family may have suggested the delusion.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will your Ladyship pardon me if I confess I do not understand you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You shall have little to complain of on that score, Miss Henderson; I
shall not speak in riddles, depend upon it. Nor should that be an obstacle
if your intelligence were only the equal of your ambition.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now, indeed, is your Ladyship completely beyond me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Had you felt that I was as much &lsquo;above&rsquo; you, Miss Henderson, it were more
to the purpose.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I sincerely hope that I have never forgotten all the deference I owe your
Ladyship,&rdquo; said Kate. Nor could humble words have taken a more humble
accent; and yet they availed little to conciliate her to whom they were
addressed; nay, this very humility seemed to irritate and provoke her to a
greater show of temper, as with an insolent laugh she said,&mdash;&ldquo;This
mockery of respect never imposed on we, young lady. I have been bred and
born in a rank where real deference is so invariable that the fictitious
article is soon detected, had there been any hardy enough to attempt it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kate made no other answer to this speech than a deep inclination of her
head. It might mean assent, submission, anything.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You may remember, Miss Henderson,&rdquo; said her Ladyship, with all the
formality of a charge in her manner,&mdash;&ldquo;you may remember that on the
day I engaged your services you were obliging enough to furnish me with a
brief summary of your acquirements.&rdquo; She paused, as if expecting some
intimation of assent, and after an interval of a few seconds, Kate smiled,
and said,&mdash;&ldquo;It must have been a very meagre catalogue, my Lady.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Quite the reverse. It was a perfect marvel to me how you ever found time
to store your mind with such varied information; and yet, notwithstanding
that imposing array of accomplishments, I now find that your modesty&mdash;perhaps
out of deference to my ignorance&mdash;withheld fully as many more.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kate&rsquo;s look of bewilderment at this speech was the only reply she made.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, of course you do not understand me,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea, sneeringly;
&ldquo;but I mean to be most explicit. Have you any recollection of the
circumstance I allude to?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I remember perfectly the day, madam, I waited on you for the first time.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I mean. Now, pray, has any portion of our discourse
dwelt upon your mind?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lady; a remark of your Ladyship&rsquo;s made a considerable impression
upon me at the moment, and has continued frequently to rise to my
recollection since that.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;May I ask what it was?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was with reference to the treatment I had been so long accustomed to
in the family of the Duchesse de Luygnes, and which your Ladyship
characterized by an epithet I have never forgotten. At the time I thought
it severe; I have learned to see it just. You called it an &lsquo;irreparable
mischief.&rsquo; Your Ladyship said most truly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was never more convinced of the fact than at this very moment,&rdquo; said
Lady Dorothea, as a flush of anger covered her cheek. &ldquo;The ill-judging
condescension of your first protectors has left a very troublesome legacy
for their successors. Your youth and inexperience&mdash;I do not desire to
attribute it to anything more reprehensible&mdash;led you, probably, into
an error regarding the privileges you thus enjoyed, and you fancied that
you owed to your own claims what you were entirely indebted to from the
favor of others.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have no doubt that the observation of your Ladyship is quite correct,&rdquo;
 said Kate, calmly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I sincerely wish that the conviction had impressed itself upon your
conduct then,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea, whose temper was never so outraged as
by the other&rsquo;s self-possession. &ldquo;Had such been the case, I might have
spared myself the unpleasantness of my present task.&rdquo; Her passion was now
fully roused, and with redoubled energy she continued: &ldquo;Your ambition has
taken a high flight, young lady, and, from the condescension by which I
accorded you a certain degree of influence in this family, you have
aspired to become its head. Do not affect any misconception of my meaning.
My son has told me everything&mdash;everything&mdash;from your invaluable
aid to him in his pecuniary difficulties, to your sage counsels on his
betting-book; from the admirable advice you gave him as to his studies, to
the disinterested offer of your own tuition. Be assured if <i>he</i> has
not understood all the advantages so generously presented to him, I, at
least, appreciate them fully. I must acknowledge you have played your game
cleverly, and you have made the mock independence of your character the
mask of your designs. With another than myself you might have succeeded,
too,&rdquo; said her Ladyship, with a smile of bitter irony; &ldquo;but <i>I</i> have
few self-delusions, Miss Henderson, nor is there amongst the number that
of believing that any one serves me, in any capacity, from any devotion to
my own person. I natter myself, at least, that I have so much of
humility.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I understand your Ladyship aright, I am charged with some designs on
Captain Martin?&rdquo; said Kate, calmly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; precisely so,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea, haughtily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can only protest that I am innocent of all such, my Lady,&rdquo; said she,
with an expression of great deference. &ldquo;It is a charge that does not admit
of any other refutation, since, if I appeal to my conduct, your Ladyship&rsquo;s
suspicions would not exculpate me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I thought so. What, then, can I adduce? I&rsquo;m sure your Ladyship&rsquo;s own
delicacy will see that this is not a case where testimony can be invoked.
I cannot&mdash;you would not ask me to&mdash;require an acquittal from the
lips of Captain Martin himself; humble as I stand here, my Lady, you never
could mean to expose me to this humiliation.&rdquo; For the first time did her
voice falter, and a sickly paleness came over her as she uttered the last
words.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The humiliation which you had intended for this family, Miss Henderson,
is alone what demands consideration from <i>me</i>. If what you call your
exculpation requires Captain Martin&rsquo;s presence, I confess I see no
objection to it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is only, then, because your Ladyship is angry with me that you could
bring yourself to think so, especially since another and much easier
solution of the difficulty offers itself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How so? What do you mean?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To send me home, madam.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I understand you, young lady. I am to send you back to your father&rsquo;s
house as one whose presence here was too dangerous, whose attractions
could only be resisted by means of absence and distance. A very
interesting martyrdom might have been made of it, I &lsquo;ve no doubt, and even
some speculation as to the conduct of a young gentleman so suddenly
bereaved of the object of his affections. But all this is much too
dignified for me. <i>My</i> son shall be taught to respect himself without
the intervention of any contrivance.&rdquo;

</div>
<p>
As she uttered the last words, she arose and approached the bell.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your Ladyship surely is not going&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am going to send for Captain Martin, Miss Henderson.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do not, I entreat of you,&mdash;I implore your Ladyship,&rdquo; cried Kate,
with her clasped hands trembling as she spoke.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;This agitation is not without a cause, and would alone decide me to call
for my son.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I have ever deserved well at your hands, my Lady,&mdash;if I have
served you faithfully in anything,&mdash;if my devotion has lightened you
of one care, or aided you through one difficulty,&mdash;spare me, oh,
spare me, I beseech you, this&mdash;degradation!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have a higher consideration to consult here, Miss Henderson, than any
which can have reference to you.&rdquo; She pulled the bell violently, and while
her hand still held the cord, the servant entered. &ldquo;Tell Captain Martin to
come here,&rdquo; said she, and sat down.
</p>
<p>
Kate leaned her arm upon the chimney-piece, and, resting her head on it,
never uttered a word.
</p>
<p>
For several minutes the silence was unbroken on either side. At last Lady
Dorothea started suddenly, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;We cannot receive Captain
Martin here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your Ladyship is full of consideration,&rdquo; said Kate, bitterly. &ldquo;For a
moment I had thought it was only an additional humiliation to which you
had destined me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Follow me into the drawing-room, Miss Henderson,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea,
proudly, as she left the room. And with slow, submissive mien Kate quitted
the chamber, and walked after her.
</p>
<p>
Scarcely had the door of the drawing-room been closed upon them than it
was re-opened to admit Captain Martin. He was booted and spurred for his
afternoon canter, and seemed in no wise pleased at the sudden interruption
to his project.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They said you wanted me,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;and here have I been searching for
you in your dressing-room, and all over the house.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I desire to speak with you,&rdquo; said she, proudly; and she motioned to a
chair.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I trust the <i>séance</i> is to be a brief one, otherwise I &lsquo;ll beg a
postponement,&rdquo; said he, half laughingly. Then turning his glance towards
Kate, he remarked for the first time the deathlike color of her face, and
an expression of repressed suffering that all her self-control could not
conceal. &ldquo;Has anything happened? What is it?&rdquo; said he, in a half-whisper.
</p>
<p>
But she never replied, nor even seemed to heed his question.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tell me, I beseech you,&rdquo; cried he, turning to Lady Dorothea,&mdash;&ldquo;tell
me, has anything gone wrong?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is precisely on that account I have sent for you, Captain Martin,&rdquo;
 said her Ladyship, as she assigned to him a seat with a motion of her
hand. &ldquo;It is because a great deal has gone wrong here&mdash;and were it
not for my vigilance, much more still likely to follow it&mdash;I have
sent for you, sir, that you should hear from this young lady&rsquo;s lips a
denial which, I own, has not satisfied <i>me</i>; nor shall it, till it be
made in your presence and meet with your corroboration. Your looks, Miss
Henderson,&rdquo; said she, addressing her, &ldquo;would imply that all the suffering
of the present moment falls to <i>your</i> share; but I would beg you to
bear in mind what a person in <i>my</i> sphere must endure at the bare
possibility of the event which now demands investigation.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens! will not you tell me what it is?&rdquo; exclaimed Martin, in the
last extremity of impatience.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have sent for you, sir,&rdquo; resumed she, &ldquo;that you should hear Miss
Henderson declare that no attentions on your part&mdash;no assiduities, I
should perhaps call them&mdash;have ever been addressed to her; that, in
fact&rdquo;&mdash;here her Ladyship became embarrassed in her explanation,&mdash;&ldquo;that,
in fact, those counsels&mdash;those very admirable aids to your conduct
which she on so many occasions has vouchsafed to afford you&mdash;have had
no object&mdash;no ulterior object, I should perhaps call it&mdash;and
that your&mdash;your intercourse has ever been such as beseems the heir of
Cro&rsquo; Martin, and the daughter of the steward on that property!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;By Jove, I can make nothing of all this!&rdquo; cried the Captain, whose
bewildered looks fully corroborated the assertion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lady Dorothea, sir, requires you to assure her that I have never made
love to you,&rdquo; said Kate Henderson, with a look of scorn that her Ladyship
did not dare to reply to. &ldquo;<i>I</i>,&rdquo; added she, &ldquo;have already given my
pledge on this subject. I trust that your testimony will not gainsay me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Confound me if I can fathom it at all!&rdquo; said he, more distracted than
ever. &ldquo;If you are alluding to the offer I made you&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The offer you made,&rdquo; cried Lady Dorothea. &ldquo;When?&mdash;how?&mdash;in what
wise?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no, I will speak out,&rdquo; said he, addressing Kate. &ldquo;I am certain <i>you</i>
never divulged it; but I cannot accept that all the honorable dealing
should be on one side only. Yes, my Lady, however you learned it, I cannot
guess, but it is perfectly true; I asked Miss Henderson to be my wife, and
she refused me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A low, faint sigh broke from Lady Dorothea, and she fell back into her
chair.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She would have it,&mdash;it&rsquo;s not my fault,&mdash;you are witness it&rsquo;s
not,&rdquo; muttered he to Kate. But she motioned him in silence to the door,
and then opening the window, that the fresh air might enter, stood
silently beside the chair.
</p>
<p>
A slight shivering shook her; and Lady Dorothea&mdash;her cheeks almost
lividly pale&mdash;raised her eyes and fixed them on Kate Henderson.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have had your triumph!&rdquo; said she, in a low but firm voice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do not feel it such, madam,&rdquo; said Kate, calmly. &ldquo;Nor is it in a moment
of humiliation like this that a thought of triumph can enter.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hear me,&mdash;stoop down lower. You can leave this&mdash;tomorrow, if
you wish it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kate bowed slowly in acquiescence.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have no need to ask you that what has occurred here should never be
mentioned.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You may trust me, madam.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I feel that I may. There&mdash;I am better&mdash;quite well, now! You may
leave me.&rdquo; Kate courtesied deeply, and moved towards the door. &ldquo;One word
before you go. Will you answer me one question? I&rsquo;ll ask but one; but your
answer must be full, or not at all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So it shall be, madam. What is it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I want to know the reason&mdash;on what grounds&mdash;you declined the
proposal of my son?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;For the same good reason, madam, that should have prevented his ever
making it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Disparity&mdash;inequality of station, you mean?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Something like it, madam. Our union would have been both a blunder and a
paradox. Each would have married beneath him!&rdquo; And once more courtesying,
and with an air of haughty dignity, Kate withdrew, and left her Ladyship
to her own thoughts.
</p>
<p>
Strange and conflicting were the same thoughts; at one moment stimulating
her to projects of passionate vengeance, at the next suggesting the
warmest measures of reconciliation and affection. These indeed
predominated, for in her heart pride seemed the emblem of all that was
great, noble, or exalted; and when she saw that sentiment, not fostered by
the accidents of fortune, not associated with birth, lineage, and high
station, but actually rising superior to the absence of all these, she
almost felt a species of worship for one so gloriously endowed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She might be a duchess!&rdquo; was the only speech she uttered, and the words
revealed a whole volume of her meditations. It was curious enough how
completely all recollection of her son was merged and lost in the greater
interest Kate&rsquo;s character supplied. But so is it frequently in life. The
traits which most resemble our own are those we alone attach importance
to, and what we fancy admiration of another is very often nothing more
than the gratified contemplation of ourselves.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXIII. MAURICE SCANLAN ADVISES WITH &ldquo;HIS COUNSEL&rdquo;
 </h2>
<p>
Jack Massingbred sat in expectation of Mr. Merl&rsquo;s arrival till nigh ten
o&rsquo;clock; and if not manifesting any great degree of impatience at the
delay, still showing unmistakable signs of uneasiness, as though the event
were not destitute of some cause for anxiety. At last a note arrived to
say that a sudden and imperative necessity to start at once for England
would prevent Mr. Merl from keeping his appointment. &ldquo;I shall be in town
by Tuesday,&rdquo; continued the writer, &ldquo;and if Captain Martin has any
communication to make to me respecting his affairs, let it be addressed to
Messrs. Twining and Scape&rsquo;s, solicitors, Furnival&rsquo;s Inn. I hope that with
regard to your own matter, you will make suitable provision for the
acceptance due on the ninth of next month. Any further renewal would prove
a great inconvenience to yours
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very sincerely and to command,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Herman Merl.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Negotiations have ended ere they were opened, and war is proclaimed at
once,&rdquo; said Massingbred, as he read over this brief epistle. &ldquo;You may come
forth, Master Scanlan,&rdquo; added he, opening the door of his bedroom, and
admitting that gentleman. &ldquo;Our Hebrew is an overmatch for us. He declines
to appear.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why so? How is that?&rdquo; asked Scanlan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There &lsquo;s his note,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;read and digest it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This smacks of suspicion,&rdquo; said Scanlan. &ldquo;He evidently suspects that we
have concerted some scheme to entangle him, and he is resolved not to be
caught.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Precisely; he &lsquo;ll do nothing without advice. Well, well, if he but knew
how unprepared we are, how utterly deficient not only in resources, but
actually in the commonest information of our subject, he might have
ventured here in all safety.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Has Captain Martin not put you in possession of the whole case, then?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, my good Scanlan, the Captain knows nothing, actually nothing, of his
difficulties. He has, it is true, a perfect conviction that he is out of
his depth; but whether he be in five fathom water or fifty, he doesn&rsquo;t
know; and, what &lsquo;s stranger, he does n&rsquo;t care!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;After all, if it be over his head, I suppose it&rsquo;s pretty much the same
thing,&rdquo; said Scanlan, with a bitter laugh.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I beg to offer my dissent to that doctrine,&rdquo; said Mas-singbred, gently.
&ldquo;Where the water is only just out of a man&rsquo;s depth, the shore is usually
not very distant. Now, if we were quite certain such were the case here,
we might hope to save him. If, on the contrary, he has gone down out of
all sight of land&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped, gazed steadily at Scanlan for a few
seconds, and then in a lower tone, not devoid of a touch of anxiety, said,
&ldquo;Eh, do you really know this to be so?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all I know, Mr. Massingbred,&rdquo; said he, as having turned the
key in the door, he took his seat at the table. &ldquo;And I &lsquo;ll tell you,
besides, how I came by the knowledge, and I &lsquo;ll leave it to your own
judgment to say what his chance is worth. When Merl was stopping at
Kilkieran, he left there a little pocket-book, with memorandums of all his
secret transactions. Mighty nice doings they were,&mdash;and profitable,
too,&mdash;as you &lsquo;ll perceive when you look over it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have it, then,&rdquo; cried Jack, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said he, producing the precious volume, and laying his hand
firmly on it. &ldquo;Here it is now. I got it under a pledge to hand it to
himself, which I need n&rsquo;t tell you I never had the slightest intention of
performing. It&rsquo;s not every day in the week one has the good luck to get a
peep into the enemy&rsquo;s brief, and this is exactly what you &lsquo;ll find here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Massingbred stretched out his hand to take the book, but Scanlan quietly
replaced it in his pocket, and, with a dry and very peculiar smile, said,&mdash;&ldquo;Have
a little patience, sir. We must go regularly to work here. You shall see
this book&mdash;you shall examine it&mdash;and even retain it&mdash;but it
must be on conditions.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, you may confide in me, Scanlan. Even if Mr.
Merl were my friend,&mdash;which I assure you he is not,&mdash;I could not
venture to betray <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not exactly what I &lsquo;m thinking of, Mr. Massingbred. I &lsquo;m certain
you &lsquo;d say nothing to Merl of what you saw here. My mind is easy enough
upon that score.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, in what direction do your suspicions point?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They &lsquo;re not suspicions, sir,&rdquo; was the dry response.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Fears,&mdash;hesitations,&mdash;whatever you like to call them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are we on honor here, Mr. Massingbred?&rdquo; said Scanlan, after a pause.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;For myself, I say decidedly so,&rdquo; was the firm reply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That will do, sir. I ask only one pledge, and I &lsquo;m sure you &lsquo;ll not
refuse it: if you should think, on reflection, that what I propose to you
this evening is neither practicable nor advisable,&mdash;that, in fact,
you could neither concur in it nor aid it,&mdash;that you&rsquo;ll never, so
long as you live, divulge it to any one,&mdash;man, woman, or child. Have
I that promise?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I may safely say that.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, but do you say it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do; here is my promise.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That will do. I don&rsquo;t ask a word more. Now, Mr. Massingbred,&rdquo; said he,
replacing the book on the table, &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll tell you in the fewest words I can
how the case stands,&mdash;and brevity is essential, for we have not an
hour to lose. Merl is gone to London about this business, and we &lsquo;ll have
to follow him. <i>He &lsquo;d</i> be very glad to be rid of the affair
to-morrow, and he &lsquo;ll not waste many days till he is so. Read that bit
there, sir,&rdquo; said he, pointing to a few closely written lines in the
note-book.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried Jack, &ldquo;this is downright impossible. This is a vile
falsehood, devised for some infernal scheme of roguery. Who &lsquo;d believe
such a trumpery piece of imposition? Ah, Scanlan, you are not the wily
fellow I took you for. This same precious note-book was dropped as a
decoy, as I once knew a certain noble lord to have left his betting-book
behind him. An artful device, that can only succeed once, however. And you
really believed all this?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I did, and I do believe it,&rdquo; said Scanlan, firmly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you really say so, we must put the matter to the test. Captain Martin
is here,&mdash;we &lsquo;ll send for him, and ask him the question; but I must
say I don&rsquo;t think your position will be a pleasant one after that reply is
given.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I must remind you of your promise already, it seems,&rdquo; said Scanlan. &ldquo;You
are pledged to say nothing of this, if you cannot persuade yourself to act
along with me in it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said Massingbred, slowly; &ldquo;but I never pledged myself to
credit an impossibility.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I ask nothing of the kind. I only claim that you should adhere to what
you have said already. If this statement be untrue, all my speculations
about it fall to the ground at once. I am the dupe of a stale trick, and
there&rsquo;s an end of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, so far all well, Master Scanlan; but <i>I</i> have no fancy to be
associated in the deception. Can&rsquo;t you see that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can, sir, and I do. But perhaps there may be a readier way of
satisfying your doubts than calling for the Captain&rsquo;s evidence. There is a
little page in this same volume devoted to one Mr. Massingbred. <i>You</i>
surely may have some knowledge about <i>his</i> affairs. Throw your eye
over that, sir, and say what you think of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Massingbred took the book in his hand and perused the place pointed out to
him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;By Jove! this <i>is</i> very strange,&rdquo; said he, after a pause. &ldquo;Here is
my betting-book on the St. Hubert all transcribed in full,&mdash;however
the Jew boy got hold of it; and here &lsquo;s mention of a blessed hundred-pound
note, which, in less than five years, has grown to upwards of a thousand!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And all true? All fact?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perfectly true,&mdash;most lamentable fact, Master Scanlan! How precise
the scoundrel is in recording this loan as &lsquo;after supper at Dubos&rsquo;!&rsquo; Ay,
and here again is my unlucky wager about Martingale for the &lsquo;Chester,&rsquo; and
the handicap with Armytage. Scanlan, I recant my rash impression. This is
a real work of its great author! <i>Aut Merl&mdash;aut Diabolus</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I could have sworn it,&rdquo; said Scanlan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure you could, man, and have done, ere this time o&rsquo; day, fifty
other things on fainter evidence. But let me tell you it requires strong
testimony to make one believe that there should live such a consummate
fool in the world as would sell his whole reversionary right to a splendid
state of some twelve thousand&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Fifteen at the lowest,&rdquo; broke in Scanlan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Worse again. Fifteen thousand a year for twenty-two thousand seven
hundred and sixty-four pounds sterling.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And he has done it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no; the thing is utterly incredible, man. Any one must see that if he
did want to make away with his inheritance, that he could have obtained
ten, twenty times that sum amongst the tribe of Merl.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No doubt, if he were free to negotiate the transaction. But you &lsquo;ll see,
on looking over these pages, in what a network of debt he was involved,&mdash;how,
as early as four years ago, at the Cape, he owed Merl large sums, lost at
play, and borrowed at heavy interest. So that, at length, this same
twenty-two thousand, assumed as paid for the reversion, was in reality but
the balance of an immense demand for money lost, bills renewed, sums lent,
debts discharged, and so on. But to avoid the legal difficulty of an
‘immoral obligation,&rsquo; the bale of the reversion is limited to this simple
payment of twenty-two thousand&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Seven hundred and sixty-four pounds, sir. Don&rsquo;t let us diminish the price
by a fraction,&rdquo; said Massingbred. &ldquo;Wonderful people ye are, to be sure;
and whether in your talent for savings, or dislike for sausages, alike
admirable and praiseworthy! What a strange circle do events observe, and
how irrevocable is the law of the material, the stern rule of the moral
world, decay, decomposition, and regeneration following on each other; and
as great men&rsquo;s ashes beget grubs, so do illustrious houses generate in
their rottenness the race of Herman Merls.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Scanlan tried to smile at the rhapsodical conceit, but for some private
reason of his own he did not relish nor enjoy it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So, then, according to the record,&rdquo; said Massingbred, holding up the
book, &ldquo;there is an end of the &lsquo;Martins of Cro&rsquo; Martin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, sir, in one word.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is too shocking&mdash;too horrible to believe,&rdquo; said Mas-singbred,
with more of sincerity than his manner usually displayed. &ldquo;Eh, Scanlan,&mdash;is
it not so?&rdquo; added he, as waiting in vain for some show of concurrence.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe, however,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the history of every great
family&rsquo;s downfall: small liabilities growing in secrecy to become heavy
charges, severe pressure exerted by those out of whose pockets came
eventually the loans to meet the difficulties,&mdash;shrewdness and
rapacity on one side, folly and wastefulness on the other.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay; but who ever heard of a whole estate disposed of for less than
two years of its rental?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly the case, sir,&rdquo; said he, in the same calm tone as before;
&ldquo;and what makes matters worse, we have little time to look out for
expedients. Magennis will put us on our title at the new trial next
assizes. Merl will take fright at the insecurity of his claim, and dispose
of it,&mdash;Heaven knows to whom,&mdash;perhaps to that very league now
formed to raise litigation against all the old tenures.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stop, stop, Scanlan! There is quite enough difficulty before us, without
conjuring up new complications,&rdquo; cried Massingbred. &ldquo;Have you anything to
suggest? What ought to be done here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Scanlan was silent, and leaning his head on his hand seemed lost in
thought.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, Scanlan, you &lsquo;ve thought over all this ere now. Tell me, man, what
do you advise?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Scanlan was silent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Out with it, Scanlan. I know, I feel that you have a resource in store
against all these perils! Out with it, man.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have I any need to remind you of your promise, Mr. Massingbred?&rdquo; asked
the other, stealthily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not the slightest, Scanlan. I never forget a pledge.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very well, sir; that&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; said Scanlan, speaking rapidly, and like
one anxious to overcome his confusion by an effort. &ldquo;We have just one
thing to do. We must buy out Merl. Of course as reasonably as we can, but
buy him out we must. What between his own short experiences of Ireland,
and the exposure that any litigation is sure to bring with it, he&rsquo;s not
likely to be hard to deal with, particularly when we are in possession, as
I suppose we may be, through <i>your</i> intimacy with the Captain, of all
the secret history of these transactions. I take it for granted that he
‘ll be as glad of a settlement that keeps all &lsquo;snug,&rsquo; as ourselves. Less
than the twenty-two thousand we can&rsquo;t expect he&rsquo;ll take.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And how are we to raise that sum without Mr. Martin&rsquo;s concurrence?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish that was the only difficulty,&rdquo; said Scanlan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just this: that in his present state no act of his would stand. Sure his
mind is gone. There isn&rsquo;t a servant about him could n&rsquo;t swear to his
fancies and imaginations. No, sir, the whole thing must be done amongst
ourselves. I have eight thousand some hundred pounds of my own available
at a moment; old Nelligan would readily&mdash;for an assignment of the
Brewery and the Market Square&mdash;advance us ten thousand more;&mdash;the
money, in short, could be had&mdash;more if we wanted it&mdash;the
question&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;As to the dealing with Merl?&rdquo; broke in Jack.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, sir, not that, though of course it is a most important
consideration.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, what then?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;As to the dealing with Maurice Scanlan, sir,&rdquo; said he, making a great
effort. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the whole question in one word.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that there can be any grave obstacle against that. You know
the property.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Every acre of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You know how you&rsquo;d like your advance to be secured to you&mdash;on what
part of the estate. The conditions, I am certain, might be fairly left in
your own hands; I feel assured you&rsquo;d not ask nor expect anything beyond
what was equitable and just.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Massingbred, we might talk this way a twelvemonth, and never be a bit
nearer our object than when we began,&rdquo; said Scanlan, resolutely. &ldquo;I want
two things, and I won&rsquo;t take less than the two together. One is to be
secured in the agency of the estate, under nobody&rsquo;s control whatever but
the Martins themselves. No Mister Repton to say &lsquo;Do this, sign that, seal
the other.&rsquo; I &lsquo;ll have nobody over me but him that owns the property.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, and the other condition?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The other&mdash;the other&mdash;&rdquo; said Scanlan, growing very red&mdash;&ldquo;the
other, I suppose, will be made the great difficulty&mdash;at least, on my
Lady&rsquo;s side. She &lsquo;ll be bristling up about her uncle the Marquis, and her
half-cousin the Duke, and she&rsquo;ll be throwing in my teeth who I am, and
what I was, and all the rest of it, forgetting all the while where they
‘ll be if they reject my terms, and how much the most noble Viceroy will
do for her when she has n&rsquo;t a roof over her head, and how many letters his
Grace will write when she has n&rsquo;t a place to address them to,&mdash;not to
say that the way they&rsquo;re treating the girl at this very moment shows how
much they think of her as one of themselves, living with old Catty Broon,
and cantering over the country without as much as a boy after her. Sure,
if they were n&rsquo;t Pride itself, it&rsquo;s glad they might be that a&mdash;a&mdash;a
respectable man, that is sure to be devoted to their own interests
forever, and one that knows the estate well, and, moreover than that, that
doesn&rsquo;t want to be going over to London,&mdash;no, nor even to Dublin,&mdash;that
doesn&rsquo;t care a brass farthing for the castle and the lodge in the park,&mdash;that,
in short, Mr. Massingbred, asks nothing for anybody, but is willing to
trust to his industry and what he knows of life&mdash;There it is now,&mdash;there&rsquo;s
my whole case,&rdquo; said he, stammering, and growing more and more
embarrassed. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a word to add to it, except this: that if they&rsquo;d
rather be ruined entirely, left without stick or stone, roof or rafter in
the world, than take my offer, they &lsquo;ve nothing to blame but themselves
and their own infernal pride!&rdquo; And with this peroration, to deliver which
cost him an effort like a small apoplexy, Maurice Scanlan sat down at the
table, and crossed his arms on his breast like one prepared to await his
verdict with a stout heart.
</p>
<p>
At last, and with the start of one who &ldquo;suddenly bethought him of a
precaution that ought not to be neglected,&rdquo; he said,&mdash;&ldquo;Of course,
this is so far all between ourselves, for if I was to go up straight to my
Lady, and say, &lsquo;I want to marry your niece,&rsquo; I think I know what the
answer would be.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Although Massingbred had followed this rambling and incoherent effort at
explanation with considerable attention, it was only by the very
concluding words that he was quite certain of having comprehended its
meaning. If we acknowledge that he felt almost astounded by the
pretension, it is but fair to add that nothing in his manner or air
betokened this feeling. Nay, he even by a slight gesture of the head
invited the other to continue; and when the very abrupt conclusion did
ensue, he sat patiently, as it were revolving the question in his own
mind.
</p>
<p>
Had Scanlan been waiting for the few words which from a jury-box determine
a man&rsquo;s fate forever, he could not have suffered more acute anxiety than
he felt while contemplating the other&rsquo;s calm and unmoved countenance. A
bold, open rejection of his plan, a defiant repudiation of his
presumption, would not probably have pained him more, if as much as the
impassive quietness of Jack&rsquo;s demeanor.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you think that this is a piece of impudence on my part, Mr.
Massingbred,&mdash;if it&rsquo;s your opinion that in aspiring to be connected
with the Martins I&rsquo;m forgetting my place and my station, just say so at
once. Tell it to me frankly, and I&rsquo;ll know how to bear it,&rdquo; said he, at
last, when all further endurance had become impossible.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing of the kind, my dear Scanlan,&rdquo; said Jack, smiling blandly.
&ldquo;Whatever snobbery once used to prevail on these subjects, we have come to
live in a more generous age. The man of character, the man who unites an
untarnished reputation to very considerable abilities, with talent to win
any station, and virtues to adorn it, such a man wants no blazonry to
illustrate his name, and it is mainly by such accessions that our English
aristocracy, refreshed and invigorated as it is, preserves its great
acknowledged superiority.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It would have required a more acute critic than Maurice Scanlan to have
detected the spirit in which this rhapsody was uttered. The apparent
earnestness of the manner did not exactly consort with a certain pomposity
of enunciation and an over-exactness in the tone of the declamation. On
the whole Maurice did not like it. It smacked to his ears very like what
he had often listened to in the Four Courts at the close of a &ldquo;junior&rsquo;s&rdquo;
 address; and there was a Nisi Prius jingle in it that sounded marvellously
unlike conviction.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If, then,&rdquo; resumed Massingbred, &ldquo;they who by the accidents of fortune, or
the meritorious services of their forefathers, represent rather in their
elevation the gratitude of their country than&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;m sorry to interrupt you, sir,&mdash;indeed, I&rsquo;m ashamed of myself for
doing it,&mdash;for your remarks are beautiful, downright eloquent; but
the truth is, this is a case touches me too closely to make me care for a
grand speech about it. I &lsquo;d rather have just a few words&mdash;to the
evidence, as one might say,&mdash;or a simple answer to a plain question,
Can this thing be done?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s where you beat us, Scanlan. There&rsquo;s where we cannot approach you.
You are practical. You reduce a matter at once to the simple dimension of
efficacy first, then possibility, and with these two conditions before you
you reject the fifty extraneous considerations, outlying contingencies,
that distract and embarrass such fellows as me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have no pretension to abilities like yours, Mr. Massingbred,&rdquo; said
Scanlan, with unassumed modesty.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Scanlan, yours are the true gifts, take my word for it!&mdash;the
recognized currency by which a man obtains what he seeks for; and there
never was an era in which such qualities bore a higher value. Our
statesmen, our diplomatists, our essay-writers,&mdash;nay, our very poets,
addressing themselves as they do to the correction of social wrongs and
class inequalities,&mdash;they are all &lsquo;practical&rsquo;! That is the type of
our time, and future historians will talk of this as the &lsquo;Age of Fact&rsquo;!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
If one were to judge from Maurice Scanlan&rsquo;s face during the delivery of
this peroration, it might be possibly inferred that he scarcely accepted
the speech as an illustration in point, since anything less practical he
had never listened to.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;When I think,&rdquo; resumed he, &ldquo;what a different effect I should have
produced in the &lsquo;House&rsquo; had I possessed this requisite! You, possibly, may
be under the impression that I achieved a great success?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I did hear as much,&rdquo; said Scanlan, half doggedly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps it was so. A first speech, you are aware, is always listened to
indulgently; not so a second, especially if a man rises soon after his
first effort. They begin to suspect they have got a talkative fellow,
eager and ready to speak on every question; they dread that, and even if
he be clever, they &lsquo;ll vote him a bore!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faith! I don&rsquo;t wonder at it!&rdquo; said Maurice, with a hearty sincerity in
the tone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yet, after all, Scanlan, let us be just! How in Heaven&rsquo;s name, are men to
become debaters, except by this same training? You require men not alone
to be strong upon the mass of questions that come up in debate, but you
expect them to be prompt with their explanations, always prepared with
their replies. Not ransacking history, or searching through &lsquo;Hansard,&rsquo; you
want a man who, at the spur of the moment, can rise to defend, to explain,
to simplify, or mayhap to assail, to denounce, to annihilate. Is n&rsquo;t that
true?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any such thing, sir!&rdquo; said Scanlan, with a sulky
determination that there was no misunderstanding.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t. Well, what <i>do</i> you ask for?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, sir, and in very few words, too, what I do <i>not</i> ask
for! I don&rsquo;t ask to be humbugged, listening to this, that, and the other,
that I have nothing to say to; to hear how you failed or why you
succeeded; what you did or what you could n&rsquo;t do. I put a plain case to
you, and I wanted as plain an answer. And as to your flattering me about
being practical, or whatever you call it, it&rsquo;s a clean waste of time,
neither less nor more!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The agency and the niece!&rdquo; said Massingbred, with a calm solemnity that
this speech had never disconcerted.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Them &lsquo;s the conditions!&rdquo; said Scanlan, reddening over face and forehead.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You &lsquo;re a plucky fellow, Scanlan, and by Jove I like you for it!&rdquo; said
Massingbred. And for once there was a hearty sincerity in the way he
spoke. &ldquo;If a man <i>is</i> to have a fall, let it be at least over a
‘rasper,&rsquo; not be thrown over a furrow in a ploughed field! You fly at high
game, but I&rsquo;m far from saying you&rsquo;ll not succeed.&rdquo; And with a jocular
laugh he turned away and left him.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXIV. A CONSULTATION
</h2>
<p>
Jack Massingbred was one of those who, in questions of difficulty, resort
to the pen in preference to personal interference. It was a fancy of his
that he wrote better than he talked. Very probably he thought so because
the contrary was the fact. On the present occasion another motive had also
its influence. It was Lady Dorothea that he addressed, and he had no
especial desire to commit himself to a direct interview.
</p>
<p>
His object was to convey Mr. Scanlan&rsquo;s propositions,&mdash;to place them
fully and intelligibly before her Ladyship without a syllable of comment
on his own part, or one word which could be construed into advocacy or
reprobation of them. In truth, had he been called upon for an opinion, it
would have sorely puzzled him what to say. To rescue a large estate from
ruin was, to be sure, a very considerable service, but to accept Maurice
Scanlan as a near member of one&rsquo;s family seemed a very heavy price even
for that. Still, if the young lady liked him, singular as the choice might
appear, other objections need not be insurmountable. The Martins were very
unlikely ever to make Ireland their residence again, they would see little
or nothing of this same Scanlan connection, &ldquo;and, after all,&rdquo; thought
Jack, &ldquo;if we can only keep the disagreeables of this life away from daily
intercourse, only knowing them through the post-office and at rare
intervals, the compact is not a bad one.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Massingbred would have liked much to consult Miss Henderson upon the
question itself, and also upon his manner of treating it; but to touch
upon the point of a marriage of inequality with her, would have been
dangerous ground. It was scarcely possible he could introduce the topic
without dropping a word, or letting fall a remark she could not seize hold
of. It was the theme, of all others, in which her sensitiveness was
extreme; nor could he exactly say whether she sneered at a <i>mésalliance,</i>
or at the insolent tone of society regarding it.
</p>
<p>
Again he bethought him of the ungraciousness of the task he had assumed,
if, as was most probable, Lady Dorothea should feel Mr. Scanlan&rsquo;s
pretensions an actual outrage. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll never forgive me for stating them,
that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but will she do so if I decline to declare
them, or worse still, leave them to the vulgar interpretation Scanlan
himself is sure to impart to them?&rdquo; While he thus hesitated and debated
with himself, now altering a phrase here, now changing a word there,
Captain Martin entered the room, and threw himself into a chair with a
more than ordinary amount of weariness and exhaustion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The governor&rsquo;s worse to-day, Massingbred,&rdquo; said he, with a sigh.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No serious change, I hope?&rdquo; said Jack.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suspect there is, though,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;They sent for me from
Lescour&rsquo;s last night, where I was winning smartly. Just like <i>my</i>
luck always, to be called away when I was &lsquo;in vein,&rsquo; and when I got here,
I found Schubart, and a French fellow whom I don&rsquo;t know, had just bled
him. It must have been touch and go, for when I saw him he was very ill&mdash;very
ill indeed&mdash;and they call him better.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was a distinct attack, then,&mdash;a seizure of some sort?&rdquo; asked
Massingbred.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I think they said so,&rdquo; said he, lighting his cigar.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But he has rallied, has n&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t fancy he has. He lifts his eyes at times, and seems to look
about for some one, and moves his lips a little, but you could scarcely
say that he was conscious, though my mother insists he is.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What does Schubart think?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who minds these fellows?&rdquo; said he, impatiently. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re only speculating
on what will be said of themselves, and so they go on: &lsquo;If this does not
occur, and the other does not happen, we shall see him better this
evening.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This is all very bad,&rdquo; said Massingbred, gloomily&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a deuced
deal worse than you know of, old fellow,&rdquo; said Martin, bitterly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps not worse than I suspect,&rdquo; said Massingbred.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Massingbred did not reply, but sat deep in thought for some time. &ldquo;Come,
Martin,&rdquo; said he, at last, &ldquo;let us be frank; in a few hours it may be,
perhaps, too late for frankness. Is this true?&rdquo; And he handed to him
Merl&rsquo;s pocket-book, open at a particular page.
</p>
<p>
Martin took it, and as his eyes traced the lines a sickly paleness covered
his features, and in a voice scarcely stronger than an infant&rsquo;s, he said,
&ldquo;It is so.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The whole reversionary right?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Every acre&mdash;every stick and stone of it&mdash;except,&rdquo; added he,
with a sickly attempt at a smile, &ldquo;a beggarly tract, near Kiltimmon, Mary
has a charge upon.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Read that, now,&rdquo; said Jack, handing him his recently written letter. &ldquo;I
was about to send it without showing it to you; but it is as well you saw
it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
While Martin was reading, Massingbred never took his eyes from him. He
watched with all his own practised keenness the varying emotions the
letter cost; but he saw that, as he finished, selfishness had triumphed,
and that the prospect of safety had blunted every sentiment as to the
price.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;what say you to that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I say it&rsquo;s a right good offer, and on no account to be refused. There is
some hitch or other&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say what, but it exists, I know&mdash;which
ties us up against selling. Old Repton and the governor, and I think my
mother, too, are in the secret; but I never was, so that Scanlan&rsquo;s
proposal is exactly what meets the difficulty.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But do you like his conditions?&rdquo; asked Jack.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I do. But what &lsquo;s that to the purpose? One must play the hand
that is dealt to them; there &lsquo;s no choice! I know that, as agent over the
property, he &lsquo;ll make a deuced good thing of it for himself. It will not
be five nor ten per cent will satisfy Master Maurice.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; but there is another condition, also,&rdquo; said Jack, quietly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;About Mary? Well, of course it&rsquo;s not the kind of thing one likes. The
fellow is the lowest of the low; but even that&rsquo;s better, in some respects,
than a species of half gentility, for he actually has n&rsquo;t one in the world
belonging to him. No one ever heard of his father or mother, and he&rsquo;s not
the fellow to go in search of them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I confess that <i>is</i> a consideration,&rdquo; said Massingbred, with a tone
that might mean equally raillery or the reverse, &ldquo;so that you see no great
objection on that score?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say I &lsquo;d choose the connection; but &lsquo;with a bad book it&rsquo;s at
least a hedge,&rsquo;&mdash;eh, Massy, is n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; said the other, dryly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It does n&rsquo;t strike me,&rdquo; said Martin, as he glanced his eye again over the
letter, &ldquo;that you have advocated Scanlan&rsquo;s plan. You have left it without,
apparently, one word of comment. Does that mean that you don&rsquo;t approve of
it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I never promised him I would advocate it,&rdquo; said Jack.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have no doubt, Massingbred, you think me a deuced selfish fellow for
treating the question in this fashion; but just reflect a little, and see
how innocently, as I may say, I was led into all these embarrassments. I
never suspected how deep I was getting. Merl used to laugh at me if I
asked him how we stood; he always induced me to regard our dealings as
trifles, to be arranged to-day, to-morrow, or ten years hence.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am not unversed in that sort of thing, unluckily,&rdquo; said Massingbred,
interrupting him. &ldquo;There is another consideration, however, in the present
case, to which I do not think you have given sufficient weight.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;As to Mary, my dear fellow, the matter is simple enough. Our consent is a
mere form. If she liked Scanlan, she &lsquo;d marry him against all the Martins
that ever were born; and if she did n&rsquo;t, she &lsquo;d not swerve an inch if the
whole family were to go to the stake for it. She &lsquo;s not one for half
measures, I promise you; and then, remember, that though she is one &lsquo;of
us,&rsquo; and well born, she has never mingled with the society of her equals;
she has always lived that kind of life you saw yourself,&mdash;taking a
cast with the hounds one day, nursing some old hag with the rheumatism the
next. I &lsquo;ve seen her hearing a class in the village school, and half an
hour after, breaking in a young horse to harness. And what between her
habits and her tastes, she is really not fit for what you and I would call
the world.&rdquo; As Massingbred made no reply, Martin ascribed his silence to a
part conviction, and went on: &ldquo;Mind, I &lsquo;m not going to say that she is not
a deuced deal too good for Maurice Scanlan, who is as vulgar a hound as
walks on two legs; but, as I said before, Massy, we haven&rsquo;t much choice.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will Lady Dorothea be likely to view the matter in this light?&rdquo; asked
Jack, calmly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is a mere matter of chance. She &lsquo;s equally likely to embrace the
proposal with ardor, or tell a footman to kick Scanlan out of the house
for his impertinence; and I own the latter is the more probable of the
two,&mdash;not, mark you, from any exaggerated regard for Mary, but out of
consideration to the insult offered to herself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will she not weigh well all the perils that menace the estate?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll take a short method with them,&mdash;she&rsquo;ll not believe them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Egad! I must say the whole negotiation is in a very promising state!&rdquo;
 exclaimed Jack, as he arose and walked the room. &ldquo;There is only one
amongst us has much head for a case of difficulty.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You mean Kate Henderson?&rdquo; broke in Martin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, we &lsquo;ve lost <i>her</i> just when we most needed her.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lost her! How&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, that she is gone&mdash;gone home. She started this morning before
daybreak. She had a tiff with my mother last night. I will say the girl
was shamefully treated,&mdash;shamefully! My Lady completely forgot
herself. She was in one of those blessed paroxysms in which, had she been
born a Pasha, heads would have been rolling about like shot in a dockyard,
and she consequently said all manner of atrocities; and instead of giving
her time to make the <i>amende</i>, Kate beat a retreat at once, and by
this time she is some twenty miles on her journey.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Massingbred walked to the window to hide the emotion these tidings
produced; for, with all his self-command, the suddenness of the
intelligence had unmanned him, and a cold and sickly feeling came over
him. There was far more of outraged and insulted pride than love in the
emotions which then moved him. The bitter thought of the moment was, how
indifferent she felt about <i>him</i>,&mdash;how little <i>he</i> weighed
in any resolve she determined to follow. She had gone without a word of
farewell,&mdash;perhaps without a thought of him. &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said he to
himself; &ldquo;there has been more than enough of humiliation to me in our
intercourse. It is time to end it! The whole was a dream, from which the
awaking was sure to be painful. Better meet it at once, and have done with
it.&rdquo; There was that much of passion in this resolve that proved how far
more it came from wounded pride than calm conviction; and so deeply was
his mind engrossed with this feeling, that Martin had twice spoken to him
ere he noticed his question.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean, then, to show that letter to my mother?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay; I have written it with that object Scanlan asked me to be his
interpreter, and I have kept my pledge.&mdash;And did she go alone,&mdash;unaccompanied?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I fancy so; but, in truth, I never asked. The doctors were here, and all
that fuss and confusion going on, so that I had really little head for
anything. After all, I suspect she&rsquo;s a girl might be able to take care of
herself,&mdash;should n&rsquo;t you say so?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Massingbred was silent for a while, and then said: &ldquo;You &lsquo;ll have to be on
the alert about this business of yours, Martin; and if I can be of service
to you, command me. I mean to start for London immediately.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;ll see my mother at once, then,&rdquo; said he, taking up Massingbred&rsquo;s
letter.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Shall I meet you in about an hour, in the Lichtenthal Avenue?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said he; and they parted.
</p>
<p>
We have no need, nor have we any right, to follow Massingbred as he
strolled out to walk alone in an alley of the wood. Irresolution is an
intense suffering to men of action; and such was the present condition of
his mind. Week after week, month after month, had he lingered on in
companionship with the Martins, till such had become the intimacy between
them that they scrupled not to discuss before him the most confidential
circumstances, and ask his counsel on the most private concerns. He
fancied that he was &ldquo;of them;&rdquo; he grew to think that he was, somehow, part
and parcel of the family, little suspecting the while that Kate Henderson
was the link that bound him to them, and that without her presence they
resolved themselves into three individuals for whom he felt wonderfully
little of interest or affection. &ldquo;She is gone, and what have I to stay
for?&rdquo; was the question he put to himself; and for answer he could only
repeat it.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXV. A COMPROMISE
</h2>
<p>
There are many who think that our law of primogeniture is a sad hardener
of the heart,&mdash;estranging the father from the son, widening petty
misunderstandings to the breadth of grievances, engendering suspicions
where there should be trustfulness, and opening two roads in life to those
who should rightfully have trod one path together. If one half of this be
the price we pay for our &ldquo;great houses,&rdquo; the bargain is a bad one! But
even taking a wide margin for exaggeration,&mdash;allowing much for the
prejudices of those who assail this institution,&mdash;there is that which
revolts against one&rsquo;s better nature, in the ever-present question of
money, between the father and his heir. The very fact that separate rights
suggest separate interests is a source of discord; while the inevitable
law of succession is a stern defiance to that sense of protection on one
side, and dependence on the other, that should mark their relations to
each other.
</p>
<p>
Captain Martin was not devoid of affection for his family. He had, it is
true, been very little at home, but he did not dislike it, beyond the
&ldquo;boredom&rdquo; of a rather monotonous kind of life. He was naturally of a
plastic temperament, however, and he lived amongst a set whose good
pleasure it is to criticise all who belong to them with the very frankest
of candor. One told how his governor, though rolling in wealth, kept him
on a most beggarly allowance, illustrating, with many an amusing story,
traits of avarice that set the table in a roar. Another exhibited his as
such a reckless spendthrift that the family estate would never cover the
debts. There was a species of rivalry on seeing who should lay most open
to public view details and incidents purely belonging to a family. It was
even a principle of this new school to discuss, and suffer others to
discuss before them, the class and condition of life of their parents in a
tone of mockery and derision, whenever the occasion might admit it; and
the son of the manufacturer or the trader listened to allusions to his
birth and parentage, and even jested upon them himself, in a spirit more
flattering to his philosophy than to his pride.
</p>
<p>
Martin had lived amidst all this for years. He had been often complimented
upon the &ldquo;jolly good thing he was to have one of these days;&rdquo; he had been
bantered out of many a wise and prudent economy, by being reminded of that
&ldquo;deuced fine property nobody could keep him out of.&rdquo; &ldquo;What can it signify
to <i>you</i> old fellow, a few hundreds more or less. You must have
fifteen thousand a year yet. The governor can&rsquo;t live forever, I take it.&rdquo;
 Others, too, as self-invited guests, speculated on all the pleasures of a
visit to Cro&rsquo; Martin; and if at first the young man heard such projects
with shame and repugnance, he learned at last to listen to them with
indifference, perhaps with something less!
</p>
<p>
Was it some self-accusing on this score that now overwhelmed him as he sat
alone in his room, trying to think, endeavoring to arouse himself to
action, but so overcome that he sat there only half conscious, and but
dimly discerning the course of events about him? At such moments external
objects mingle their influences with our thoughts, and the sound of
voices, the tread of footsteps, the mere shutting of a door, seem to blend
themselves with our reveries, and give somewhat of reality to our dreamy
fancies. A large clock upon the mantelpiece had thus fixed his attention,
and he watched the minute-hand as though its course was meting out the
last moments of existence. &ldquo;Ere it reach that hour,&rdquo; thought he, fixing
his gaze upon the dial, &ldquo;what a change may have come over all my
fortunes!&rdquo; Years&mdash;long years&mdash;seemed to pass over as he waited
thus; scenes of childhood, of infancy itself, mingled with the gay
dissipations of his after-life; school days and nights at mess, wild
orgies of the play-table and sad wakings on the morrow, all moved through
his distracted brain, till at length it was only by an effort that he
could shake off these flitting fancies and remember where he was.
</p>
<p>
He at once bethought him that there was much to be done. He had given
Massingbred&rsquo;s letter to his mother, entreating a prompt answer, but two
hours had now elapsed and she had not sent her reply. There was a struggle
between his better nature and his selfishness whether to seek her. The
thought of that sick-room, dark and silent, appalled him. &ldquo;Is it at such a
time I dare ask her to address her mind to this? and yet hours are now
stealing over which may decide my whole fate in life.&rdquo; While he thus
hesitated, Lady Dorothea entered the room. Nights of anxiety and watching,
the workings of a spirit that fought inch by inch with fortune, were
deeply marked upon her features. Weariness and fatigue had not brought
depression on her, but rather imparted a feverish lustre to her eyes, and
an expression of haughty energy to her face.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Am I to take this for true,&rdquo; said she, as, seating herself in front of
him, she held out Massingbred&rsquo;s letter,&mdash;&ldquo;I mean, of course, what
relates to yourself?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He nodded sorrowfully, but did not speak.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;All literally the fact?&rdquo; said she, speaking slowly, and dwelling on every
word. &ldquo;You have actually sold the reversion of the estate?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And am beggared!&rdquo; said he, sternly.
</p>
<p>
Lady Dorothea tried to speak. She coughed, cleared her throat, made
another effort, but without succeeding; and then, in a slightly broken
voice, said, &ldquo;Fetch me a glass of water. No, sit down; I don&rsquo;t want it.&rdquo;
 The blood again mounted to her pale cheeks, and she was herself again.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;These are hard terms of Scanlan&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said she, in a dry, stern tone. &ldquo;He
has waited, too, till we have little choice remaining. Your father is
worse.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Worse than when I saw him this morning?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Weaker, and less able to bear treatment. He is irritable, too, at that
girl&rsquo;s absence. He asks for her constantly, and confuses her in his mind
with Mary.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what does Schubart think?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what he <i>says</i>,&rdquo; replied she, with a marked emphasis
on the last word. &ldquo;He says the case is hopeless; he has seen such linger
for weeks, but even a day&mdash;a day&mdash;&rdquo; She tried to go on; but her
voice faltered, her lip trembled, and she was silent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I had begun to believe it so,&rdquo; muttered Martin, gloomily. &ldquo;He scarcely
recognized me yesterday.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He is perfectly collected and sensible now,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea, in her
former calm tone. &ldquo;He spoke of business matters clearly and well, and
wished to see Scanlan.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Which I trust you did not permit?&rdquo; asked Martin, hurriedly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I told him he should see him this evening, but there is no necessity for
it. Scanlan may have left this before evening.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You suspect that Scanlan would say something,&mdash;would mention to him
something of this affair?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Discretion is not the quality of the low-born and the vulgar,&rdquo; said she,
haughtily; &ldquo;self-importance alone would render him unsafe. Besides,&rdquo;&mdash;and
this she said rapidly,&mdash;&ldquo;there is nothing to detain the man here,
when he knows that we accept his conditions.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And are we to accept them?&rdquo; said Martin, anxiously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dare we refuse them? What is the alternative? I suppose what you have
done with your Jew friend has been executed legally&mdash;formally?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Trust <i>him</i> for that; he has left no flaw there!&rdquo; said Martin,
bitterly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was certain of it,&rdquo; said she, with a scarcely perceptible sneer.
&ldquo;Everything, therefore, has been effected according to law?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I believe so,&rdquo; replied he, doggedly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then really there is nothing left to us but Scanlan. He objects to
Repton; so do I. I always deemed him obtrusive and familiar. In the
management of an Irish estate such qualities may be reckoned essential. I
know what we should think of them in England, and I know where we should
place their possessor.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe the main question that presses now is, are we to have an estate
at all?&rdquo; said the Captain, bitterly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir, you have really brought it to that,&rdquo; rejoined she, with equal
asperity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you consent to his having the agency?&rdquo; asked Martin, with an immense
effort to suppress passion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you agree, also, to his proposal for Mary?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is matter of complete indifference to me who Miss Martin marries, if
she only continue to reside where she does at present. I &lsquo;m certain she &lsquo;d
not consult <i>me</i> on the subject; I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d never control <i>her</i>.
It is a <i>mésalliance</i>, to be sure; but it would be equally so, if
she, with her rustic habits and uneducated mind, were to marry what would
be called her equal. In the present case, she &lsquo;ll be a little better than
her station; in the other, she &lsquo;d be vastly beneath it!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor Molly!&rdquo; said he, half aloud; and, for the first time, there was a
touch of his father&rsquo;s tone and manner in the words.
</p>
<p>
Lady Dorothea looked at him, and with a slight shrug of the shoulders
seemed to sneer at his low-priced compassion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Scoff away!&rdquo; said he, sternly; &ldquo;but if I thought that any consent we gave
to this scheme could take the shape of a coercion, I &lsquo;d send the estate to
the&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have, sir; you have done all that already,&rdquo; broke in Lady Dorothea.
&ldquo;When the troubled breathing that we hear from yonder room ceases, there
is no longer a Martin of Cro&rsquo; Martin!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then what are we losing time for?&rdquo; cried he, eagerly. &ldquo;Are moments so
precious to be spent in attack and recrimination? There&rsquo;s Scanlan sitting
on a bench before the door. Call him up&mdash;tell him you accept his
terms&mdash;let him start for London, post haste. With every speed he can
master he &lsquo;ll not be a minute too soon. Shall I call him? Shall I beckon
to him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Send a servant for him,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea, calmly, while she folded up
the letter, and laid it on the table at her side.
</p>
<p>
Martin rang the bell and gave the order, and then, assuming an air of
composure he was very far from feeling, sat silently awaiting Scanlan&rsquo;s
entrance. That gentleman did not long detain them. He had been sitting,
watch in hand, for above an hour, looking occasionally up at the windows,
and wondering why he had not been summoned. It was, then, with an almost
abrupt haste that he at last presented himself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Read over that letter, sir,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea, &ldquo;and please to inform me
if it rightly conveys your propositions.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Scanlan perused Massingbred&rsquo;s letter carefully, and folding it up,
returned it. &ldquo;Yes, my Lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I think it embraces the chief
points. Of course there is nothing specified as to the mode of carrying
them out,&mdash;I mean, as to the security I should naturally look for. I
believe your Ladyship does not comprehend me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not in the least, sir.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, if I must speak plainer, I want to be sure that your concurrence is
no mere barren concession, my Lady; that, in admitting my pretensions,
your Ladyship favors them. This is, of course,&rdquo; said he, in a tone of
deference, &ldquo;if your Ladyship condescends to accept the terms at all; for,
as yet, you have not said so.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I had not been so minded, sir, this interview would not have taken
place.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, indeed, I thought as much myself,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and so I at once
entered upon what one might call the working details of the measure.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How long will it take you to reach London, sir?&rdquo; asked she, coldly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Four days, my Lady, travelling night and day.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How soon after your arrival there can you make such arrangements as will
put this affair out of all danger, using every endeavor in your power?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope I could answer for that within a week,&mdash;maybe, less.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to effect it in half that time, sir,&rdquo; said she, solemnly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t despair of that same, if I have only your Ladyship&rsquo;s
promise to all that is set down there. I &lsquo;ll neither eat nor sleep till
the matter is in good train.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I repeat, sir, that if this settlement be not accomplished in less than a
week from the present moment, it may prove utterly valueless.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can only say I&rsquo;ll do my best, my Lady. I&rsquo;d be on the road this minute,
if your Ladyship would dismiss me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very well, sir,&mdash;you are free. I pledge myself to the full
conditions of this letter. Captain Martin binds himself equally to observe
them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;d like it in writing under your Ladyship&rsquo;s hand,&rdquo; said Scanlan, in a
half whisper, as though afraid to speak such doubts aloud. &ldquo;It is not that
I have the least suspicion or misgiving in life about your Ladyship&rsquo;s
word,&mdash;I&rsquo;d take it for a million of money,&mdash;but when I come to
make my proposals in person to Miss Mary&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There, sir, that will do!&rdquo; said she, with a disdainful look, as if to
repress an explanation so disagreeable. &ldquo;You need not enter further upon
the question. If you address me by letter, I will reply to it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There it is, my Lady,&rdquo; said he, producing a sealed epistle, and placing
it on the table before her. &ldquo;I had it ready, just not to be losing time.
My London address is inside; and if you&rsquo;ll write to me by to-morrow&rsquo;s
post,&mdash;or the day after,&rdquo; added he, remarking a movement of
impatience in her face&mdash;&ldquo;You shall have your bond, sir,&mdash;you
shall have your bond,&rdquo; broke she in, haughtily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That ought to be enough, I think,&rdquo; said the Captain, with a degree of
irritation that bespoke a long internal conflict.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I want nothing beyond what I shall earn, Captain Martin,&rdquo; said Scanlan,
as a flash of angry meaning covered his features.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And we have agreed to the terms, Mr. Scanlan,&rdquo; said her Ladyship, with a
great effort to conciliate. &ldquo;It only remains for us to say, a good
journey, and every success attend you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, my Lady; I&rsquo;m your most obedient. Captain, I wish you good-bye,
and hope soon to send you happy tidings. I trust, if Mr. Martin asks after
me, that you &lsquo;ll give him my respectful duty; and if&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll forget nothing, sir,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea, rising; and Scanlan,
after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation as to whether he should venture to offer his
hand,&mdash;a measure for which, happily, he could not muster the courage,&mdash;bowed
himself out of the room, and closed the door.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not a very cordial leave-taking for one that&rsquo;s to be her nephew,&rdquo;
 muttered he, with a bitter laugh, as he descended the stairs. &ldquo;And,
indeed, my first cousin, the Captain, is n&rsquo;t the model of family
affection. Never mind, Maurice, your day is coming!&rdquo; And with this
assuring reflection he issued forth to give orders for his journey.
</p>
<p>
A weary sigh&mdash;the outpouring of an oppressed and jaded spirit&mdash;broke
from Lady Dorothea as the door closed after him. &ldquo;Insufferable creature!&rdquo;
 muttered she to herself? and then, turning to the Captain, said aloud, &ldquo;Is
that man capable of playing us false?&mdash;or, rather, has he the power
of doing so?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is just what I have been turning over in my own mind,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t quite trust him; and, in fact, I&rsquo;d follow him over to London, if I
were free at this moment.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps you ought to do so; it might be the wisest course,&rdquo; said she,
hesitatingly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you think I could leave this with safety?&rdquo; asked he. But she did not
seem to have heard the question. He repeated it, and she was still silent.
&ldquo;If the doctors could be relied on, they should be able to tell us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To tell us what?&rdquo; asked she, abruptly, almost sternly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I meant that they&rsquo;d know&mdash;that they&rsquo;d perhaps be in a position to
judge&mdash;that they at least could warn us&mdash;&rdquo; Here he stopped,
confused and embarrassed, and quite unable to continue. That sense of
embarrassment, however, came less of his own reflections than of the cold,
steady, and searching look which his mother never ceased to bend on him.
It was a gaze that seemed to imply, &ldquo;Say on, and let me hear how destitute
of all feeling you will avow yourself.&rdquo; It was, indeed, the meaning of her
stare, and so he felt it, as the color came and went in his cheek, and a
sense of faintish sickness crept over him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The post has arrived, my Lady, and I have left your Ladyship&rsquo;s letters on
the dressing-table,&rdquo; said a servant. And Lady Dorothea, who had been
impatiently awaiting the mall, hastened at once to her room.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXVI. A LETTER THAT NEVER REACHES ITS ADDRESS
</h2>
<p>
It was not without a very painful emotion that Lady Dorothea turned over a
mass of letters addressed to her husband. They came from various quarters,
written in all the moods of many minds. Some were the mere gossip of clubs
and dinnerparties,&mdash;some were kindly and affectionate inquiries,
gentle reproachings on his silence, and banterings about his pretended low
spirits. A somewhat favorite tone is that same raillery towards those
whose lot in life seems elevated above the casualties of fortune,
forgetting the while that the sunniest path has its shadows, and they whom
we deem exempt from the sore trials of the world have their share of its
sorrows. These read strangely now, as he to whom they were addressed lay
breathing the heavy and labored breath, and muttering the low broken
murmurs that prelude the one still deeper sleep!
</p>
<p>
With a tremulous hand, and a gesture of fretful impatience, she threw them
from her one after the other. The topics and the tone alike jarred upon
her nerves. They seemed so unfeeling, too, and so heartless at such a
moment. Oh, if we wanted to moralize over the uncertainty of life, what a
theme might we have in the simple fact that, quicker than the lines we are
writing fall from our pen, are oftentimes changing the whole fate and
fortune of him for whom we destine them! We are telling of hope where
despair has already entered,&mdash;we are speaking joy to a house of
mourning! But one letter alone remained unopened. It was in Repton&rsquo;s hand,
and she broke the seal, wondering how he, who of all men hated writing,
should have turned a correspondent.
</p>
<p>
The &ldquo;strictly confidential&rdquo; of the cover was repeated within; but the hour
had come when she could violate the caution, and she read on. The first
few lines were a half-jesting allusion to Martin&rsquo;s croakings about his
health; but even these had a forced, constrained air, and none of the
jocular ease of the old man&rsquo;s manner. &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;it is
exactly about your health I am most anxious. I want you to be strong and
stout, body and mind, ready for action, and resolute. I know the tone and
style that an absentee loves and even requires to be addressed in. He
wants to be told that, however he may be personally regretted, matters go
on wonderfully well in his absence, that rent is paid, farms improved,
good markets abound, and the county a pattern of quietness. I could tell
you all this, Martin, and not a syllable of it be true. The rents are not
paid, partly from a season of great pressure, but, more still, from an
expectancy on the side of the people that something&mdash;they know not
what&mdash;is coming. The Relief Bill only relieved those who wanted to
job in politics and make market of their opinions; the masses it has
scarcely touched. They are told they are emancipated, but I am at a loss
to know in what way they realize to their minds the new privilege. Their
leaders have seen this. Shrewd fellows as they are, they have guessed what
disappointment must inevitably ensue when the long-promised boon can show
nothing as its results but certain noisy mob-orators made Parliament men;
and so they have slyly hinted,&mdash;as yet it is only a hint,&mdash;&lsquo;this
is but the first step&mdash;an instalment they call it&mdash;of a large
debt, every fraction of which must yet be paid!&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now there is not in all Europe a more cunning or a deeper fellow than
Paddy. He has an Italian&rsquo;s subtlety and a Celt&rsquo;s suspicion; but enlist his
self-love, his vanity, and his acquisitiveness in any scheme, and all his
shrewdness deserts him. The old hackney coach-horses never followed the
hay on the end of the pole more hopefully than will he travel after some
promised future of &lsquo;fine times,&rsquo; with plenty to eat and drink, and nothing
to do for it! They have booked themselves now for this journey, and the
delusion must run its course. Meanwhile rents will not be paid, farms not
improved, bad prices and poverty will abound, and the usual crop of
discontent and its consequent crime. I &lsquo;m not going to inflict you with my
own opinions on this theme. You know well enough already that I never
regarded these &lsquo;Agrarian disturbances,&rsquo; as they are called, in the light
of passing infractions of the peace, but traced in them the continuous
working of a long preconcerted plan,&mdash;the scheme of very different
heads from those who worked it,&mdash;by which the law should ever be
assailed and the right of property everlastingly put in dispute. In plain
words, the system was a standing protest against the sway of the Saxons in
Ireland! &lsquo;The agitators&rsquo; understood thoroughly how to profit by this, and
they worked these alternate moods of outrage and peace pretty much as the
priests of old guided their auguries. They brought the game to that
perfection that a murder could shake a ministry, or a blank calendar
become the triumph of an Administration!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Such is, at the moment I am writing, the actual condition of Ireland!
Come home, then, at once,&mdash;but come alone. Come back resolved to see
and act for yourself. There is a lingering spark of the old feudalism yet
left in the people. Try and kindle it up once more into the old healthful
glow of love to the landlord. Some would say it is too late for all this;
but I will not think so. Magennis has given us an open defiance; we are to
be put on our title. Now, you are well aware there is a complication here,
and I shall want to consult you personally; besides, we must have a search
through those registries that are locked up in the strong-room. Mary tells
me you carried away the key of it. I tell you frankly, I wish we could hit
upon some means of stopping Magennis. The suit is a small war, that
demands grand preparation,&mdash;always a considerable evil! The fellow, I
am told, is also concocting another attack,&mdash;an action against your
niece and others for the forcible abduction of his wife. It would read
fabulously enough, such a charge, but as old Casey said, &lsquo;There never yet
was anything you could n&rsquo;t impute at law, if you only employed the word
&ldquo;conspiracy;&rdquo;&rsquo; and I believe it! The woman certainly has deserted him, and
her whereabouts cannot be ascertained. The scandal of such a cause would
of course be very great; but if you were here we might chance upon some
mode of averting it,&mdash;at all events, your niece shouldn&rsquo;t be deserted
at such a moment. What a noble girl it is, Martin, and how gloriously she
comprehends her station! Give me a dozen like her, and I &lsquo;ll bid defiance
to all the machinations of all the agitators; and they know it!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If your estate has resisted longer than those of your neighbors the
demoralizing influences that are now at work here, you owe it to Mary. If
crime has not left its track of blood along your avenue or on your
door-sill, it is she who has saved you. If the midnight hour has not been
scared by the flame of your burning house or haggard, thank <i>her</i> for
it,&mdash;ay, Martin, <i>her</i> courage, <i>her</i> devotion, <i>her</i>
watchful charity, <i>her</i> unceasing benevolence, the glorious guarantee
her daily life gives, that <i>she</i>, at least, is with the people in all
their sufferings and their trials! You or I had abandoned with impatience
the cause that she had succored against every disappointment. Her woman&rsquo;s
nature has endowed her with a higher and a nobler energy than ever a man
possessed. She <i>will not</i> be defeated.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Henderson may bewail, and Maurice Scanlan deride, the shortcomings of the
people. But through evil and good report she is there to hear from their
own lips, to see with her own eyes, the story of their sorrows. Is this
nothing? Is there no lesson in the fact that she, nurtured in every
luxury, braves the wildest day of winter in her mission of charity?&mdash;that
the most squalid misery, the most pestilent disease never deterred her? I
saw her a few days back coming home at daybreak; she had passed the night
in a hovel where neither you nor I would have taken shelter in a storm.
The hectic flush of fatigue and anxiety was on her cheek; her eyes, deep
sunk, showed weariness; and her very voice, as she spoke to me, was
tremulous and weak; and of what, think you, was her mind full? Of the
noble calm, the glorious, patient endurance of those she had just quitted.
‘What lessons might we not learn,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;beneath the wet thatch of
poverty! There are three struck down with fever in that cabin; she who
remains to nurse them is a little girl of scarcely thirteen. There is all
that can render sickness wretched around them. They are in pain and in
want; cold winds and rain sweep across their beds, if we could call them
such. If they cherish the love of life, it must be through some instinct
above all reason; and there they lie, uncomplaining. The little remnant of
their strength exhausts itself in a look of thankfulness,&mdash;a faint
effort to say their gratitude. Oh, if querulous hypochondriacism could but
see them, what teaching it might learn! Sufferings that call forth from us
not alone peevishness and impatience, but actually traits of rude and
ungenerous meaning, develop in them an almost refined courtesy, and a
trustfulness that supplies all that is most choice in words of gratitude.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And this is the girl whose life every day, every hour is imperilling,&mdash;who
encounters all the hazards of our treacherous climate, and all the more
fatal dangers of a season of pestilence, without friends, without a home!
Now, Martin, apart from all higher and better considerations on the
subject, this was not your compact,&mdash;such was not the text of your
bargain with poor Barry. The pledge you gave him at your last parting was
that she should be your daughter. That you made her feel all the affection
of one, none can tell more surely than myself. That your own heart
responds to her love I am as fully convinced of. But this is not enough,
my dear Martin. She has rights&mdash;actual rights&mdash;that no special
pleading on the score of intentions or good wishes can satisfy. I should
but unworthily discharge my office, as your oldest friend in the world, if
I did not place this before you broadly and plainly. The country is dull
and wearisome, devoid of society, and without resources, and you leave it;
but you leave behind you, to endure all its monotony, all its weariness,
one who possesses every charm and every attention that are valued in the
great world! There is fever and plague abroad, insurrection threatens, and
midnight disturbances are rife, and she who is to confront these perils is
a girl of twenty. The spirit of an invading party threatens to break down
all the prestige of old family name and property,&mdash;a cunningly
devised scheme menaces the existence of an influence that has endured for
centuries; and to oppose its working, or fall victim to its onslaught, you
leave a young lady, whose very impulses of generous meaning may be made
snares to entrap her. In a word, you neglect duty, desert danger, shun the
path of honorable exertion, and retreat before the menace of an encounter,
to place, where you should stand yourself, the frail figure and gentle
nature of one who was a child, as it were, but yesterday. Neither your
health nor your happiness can be purchased at such a price,&mdash;your
conscience is too sound for that,&mdash;nor can your ease! No, Martin,
your thoughts will stray over here, and linger amongst these lonely glens
that she is treading. Your fancy will follow her through the dark nights
of winter, as alone she goes forth on her mission of mercy. You will think
of her, stooping to teach the young&mdash;bending over the sick-bed of
age. And then, tracing her footsteps homeward, you will see her sit down
by a solitary hearth,&mdash;none of her own around her,&mdash;not one to
advise, to counsel, to encourage her! I will say no more on this theme;
your own true heart has already anticipated all that <i>I</i> could <i>speak</i>,&mdash;all
that <i>you</i> should <i>do</i>.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now for one more question, and I shall have finished the most painful
letter I ever wrote in my life. There are rumors&mdash;I cannot trace
them, nor fully understand them, but they imply that Captain Martin has
been raising very considerable sums by reversionary bonds and post-obits.
Without being able to give even a guess, as to the truth of this, I draw
your attention to the bare possibility, as of a case full of very serious
complications. Speak to your son at once on the subject, and learn the
truth,&mdash;the whole truth. My own fears upon the matter have been
considerably strengthened by hearing of a person who has been for several
weeks back making inquiries on the estate. He has resided usually at
Kilkieran, and spends his time traversing the property in all directions,
investigating questions of rent, wages, and tenure of land. They tell
marvellous stories of his charity and so forth,&mdash;blinds, doubtless,
to cover his own immediate objects. Mary, however, I ought to say, takes a
very different view of his character, and is so anxious to know him
personally that I promised her to visit him, and bring him to visit her at
the cottage. And, by the way, Martin, why should she be at the cottage,&mdash;why
not at Cro&rsquo; Martin? What miserable economy has dictated a change that must
reflect upon her influence, not to speak of what is justly due to her own
station? I could swear that you never gave a willing consent to this
arrangement. No, no, Martin, the plan was never yours.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;m not going to bore you with borough politics. To tell truth, I can&rsquo;t
comprehend them. They want to get rid of Massingbred, but they don&rsquo;t see
who is to succeed him. Young Nelligan ought to be the man, but he will
not. He despises his party,&mdash;or at least what would call itself his
party,&mdash;and is resolved never to concern himself with public affairs.
Meanwhile he is carrying all before him at the Bar, and is as sure of the
Bench as though he were on it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;When he heard of Magennis&rsquo;s intention of bringing this action against
Mary, he came up to town to ask me to engage him on our side, &lsquo;since,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;if they send me a brief I cannot refuse it, and if I accept it,
I promise you it shall be my last cause, for I have resolved to abandon
the Bar the day after.&rsquo; This, of course, was in strictest secrecy, and so
you must regard it. He is a cold, calm fellow, and yet on this occasion he
seemed full of impulsive action.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I had something to tell you about Henderson, but I actually forget what
it was. I can only remember it was disagreeable; and as this epistle has
its due share of bitters, my want of memory is perhaps a benefit; and so
to release you at once, I &lsquo;ll write myself, as I have never ceased to be
for forty years,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your attached friend,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Val. Repton.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe I was wrong about Henderson; at least the disagreeable went no
further than that he is supposed to be the channel through which Lady
Dorothea occasionally issues directions, not always in agreement with
Mary&rsquo;s notions. And as your niece never liked the man, the measures are
not more palatable when they come through his intervention.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lady Dorothea was still pondering over this letter, in which there were so
many things to consider, when a hurried message called her to the
sick-room. As she approached the room, she could hear Martin&rsquo;s voice
calling imperiously and angrily to the servants, and ordering them to
dress him. The difficulty of utterance seemed to increase his irritation,
and gave to his words a harsh, discordant tone, very unlike his natural
voice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So,&rdquo; cried he, as she entered, &ldquo;you have come at last. I am nigh
exhausted with telling them what I want. I must get up, Dora. They must
help me to dress.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
As he was thus speaking, the servants, at a gesture from her Ladyship,
quietly stole from the chamber, leaving her alone at his bedside.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are too weak for this exertion, Godfrey,&rdquo; said she, calmly. &ldquo;Any
effort like this is certain to injure you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; asked he, with the tone of deference that he generally
used towards her. &ldquo;Perhaps you are right, Dora; but how can it be helped?&mdash;there
is so much to do, such a long way to travel. What a strange confusion is
over me! Do you know, Dolly,&rdquo;&mdash;here his voice fell to a mere whisper,&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
scarcely credit it; but all the time I have been fancying myself at Cro&rsquo;
Martin, and here we are in&mdash;in&mdash;what do you call the place?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Baden.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;but the country?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Germany.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, to be sure, Germany; hundreds of miles away from home!&rdquo; Here he
raised himself on one arm, and cast a look of searching eagerness through
the room. &ldquo;Is he gone?&rdquo; whispered he, timidly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of whom are you speaking?&rdquo; said she.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hush, Dolly, hush!&rdquo; whispered he, still lower. &ldquo;I promised I &lsquo;d not tell
any one, even you, of his being here. But I must speak of it&mdash;I must&mdash;or
my brain will turn. He was here&mdash;he sat in that very chair&mdash;he
held my hand within both his own. Poor, poor fellow! how his eyes filled
when he saw me! He little knew how changed he himself was!&mdash;his hair
white as snow, and his eyes so dimmed!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This was a dream, Godfrey,&mdash;only a dream!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I thought you &lsquo;d say so,&mdash;I knew it,&rdquo; said he, sorrowfully; &ldquo;but <i>I</i>
know better. The dear old voice rang in my heart as I used to hear it when
a child, as he said, &lsquo;Do you remember me?&rsquo; To be sure I remembered him,
and told him to go and fetch Molly; and his brow darkened when I said
this, and he drew back his hand and said, &lsquo;You have deserted her,&mdash;she
is not here!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;All this is mere fancy, Godfrey; you have been dreaming of home.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; muttered he, gloomily, &ldquo;it was but too true; we did desert her, and
that was not our bargain, Dolly. It was all the poor fellow asked at our
hands,&mdash;his last, his only condition. What&rsquo;s that letter you have
there?&rdquo; cried he, impatiently, as Lady Dorothea, in the agitation of the
moment, continued to crumple Repton&rsquo;s letter between her fingers.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A letter I have been reading,&rdquo; said she, sternly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;From whom&mdash;from whom?&rdquo; asked he, still more eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A letter from Mr. Repton. You shall read it when you are better. You are
too weak for all this exertion, God-frey; you must submit&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Submit!&rdquo; broke he in; &ldquo;the very word he said. You submit yourself to
anything, if it only purchase your selfish ease. No, Dolly, no, I am
wrong. It was I that said so. I owned to him how unworthily I had acted.
Give me that letter, madam. Let me see it,&rdquo; said he, imperiously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;When you are more tranquil, Godfrey,&mdash;in a fitting state.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I tell you, madam,&rdquo; cried he, fiercely, &ldquo;this, is no time for trifling or
deception. Repton knows all our affairs. If he has written now, it is
because matters are imminent. My head is clear now. I can think&mdash;I
can speak. It is full time Harry should hear the truth. Let him come
here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Take a little rest, Godfrey, be it only half an hour, and you shall have
everything as you wish it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Half an hour! you speak of half an hour to one whose years are minutes
now!&rdquo; said he, in a broken voice. &ldquo;This poor brain, Dora, is already
wandering. The strange things I have seen so lately&mdash;that poor fellow
come back after so many years&mdash;so changed, so sadly changed&mdash;but
I knew him through all the mist and vapor of this feverish state; I saw
him clearly, my own dear Barry!&rdquo; The word, as it were the last barrier to
his emotion, brought forth a gush of tears; and burying his face within
the bedclothes, he sobbed himself to sleep. As he slept, however, he
continued to mutter about home and long passed years,&mdash;of boyish
sports with his brother; childish joys and sorrows were all mingled there,
with now and then some gloomier reveries of later days.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He has been wandering in his mind!&rdquo; whispered Lady Dorothea to her son,
as he joined her in the darkened room. &ldquo;He woke up, believing that he had
seen his brother, and the effect was very painful.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Has he asked for <i>me?</i>&rdquo; inquired the other.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; he rambled on about Mary, and having deserted her, and all that; and
just as ill-luck would have it, here is a letter from Repton, exactly
filled with the very same theme. He insists on seeing it; but of course he
will have forgotten it when he awakes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have written to Scanlan?&rdquo; asked he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; my letter has been sent off.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Minutes are precious now. If anything should occur here,&rdquo;&mdash;his eyes
turned towards the sick-bed as he spoke,&mdash;&ldquo;Merl will refuse to treat.
His people&mdash;I know they are his&mdash;are hovering about the hotel
all the morning. I heard the waiter whispering as I passed, and caught the
words, &lsquo;No better; worse, if anything.&rsquo; The tidings would be in London
before the post.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lady Dorothea made no reply, and all was now silent, save the unequal but
heavy breathings of the sick man, and the faint, low mutterings of his
dream. &ldquo;In the arras&mdash;between the window and the wall&mdash;there it
is, Barry,&rdquo; cried he, in a clear, distinct voice. &ldquo;Repton has a copy of
it, too, with Catty&rsquo;s signature,&mdash;old Catty Broon.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What is he dreaming of?&rdquo; asked the young man.
</p>
<p>
But, instead of replying to the question, Lady Dorothea bent down her head
to catch the now muttered words of the sleeper.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He says something of a key. What key does he mean?&rdquo; asked he.
</p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0012" id="linkimage-0012">
<!-- IMG --></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/297.jpg" width="100%" alt="297 " />
</div>
<p>
&ldquo;Fetch me that writing-desk,&rdquo; said Lady Dorothea, as she took several keys
from her pockets; and noiselessly unlocking the box, she began to search
amidst its contents. As she continued, her gestures grew more and more
hurried; she threw papers recklessly here and there, and at last emptied
the entire contents upon the table before her. &ldquo;See, search if there be a
key here,&rdquo; cried she, in a broken voice; &ldquo;I saw it here three days ago.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is none here,&rdquo; said he, wondering at her eagerness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Look carefully,&mdash;look well for it,&rdquo; said she, her voice trembling at
every word.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is it of such consequence&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is of such consequence,&rdquo; broke she in, &ldquo;that he into whose hands it
falls can leave you and me beggars on the world!&rdquo; An effort at awaking by
the sick man here made her hastily restore the papers to the desk, which
she locked, and replaced upon the table.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Was it the Henderson did this?&rdquo; said she aloud, as if asking the question
of herself. &ldquo;Could she have known this secret?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did what? What secret?&rdquo; asked he, anxiously.
</p>
<p>
A low, long sigh announced that the sick man was awaking; and in a faint
voice he said, &ldquo;I feel better, Dora. I have had a sleep, and been dreaming
of home and long ago. To-morrow, or next day, perhaps, I may be strong
enough to leave this. I want to be back there again. Nay, don&rsquo;t refuse
me,&rdquo; said he, timidly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;When you are equal to the journey&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have a still longer one before me, Dora, and even less preparation for
it. Harry, I have something to say to you, if I were strong enough to say
it,&mdash;this evening, perhaps.&rdquo; Wearied by the efforts he had made, he
lay back again with a heavy sigh, and was silent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is he worse&mdash;is he weaker?&rdquo; asked his son.
</p>
<p>
A mournful nod of the head was her reply.
</p>
<p>
Young Martin arose and stole noiselessly from the room, he scarcely knew
whither; he indeed cared not which way he turned. The future threw its
darkest shadows before him. He had little to hope for, as little to love.
His servant gave him a letter which Massingbred had left on his departure,
but he never opened it; and in a listless vacuity he wandered out into the
wood.
</p>
<p>
It was evening as he turned homeward. His first glance was towards the
windows of his father&rsquo;s room. They were wont to be closely shuttered and
fastened; now one of them lay partly open, and a slight breeze stirred the
curtain within. A faint, sickly fear of he knew not what crept over him.
He walked on quicker; but as he drew nigh the door, his servant met him.
&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; cried he, as though expecting a message.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir, it is all over; he went off about an hour since.&rdquo; The man added
something; but Martin heard no more, but hurried to his room, and locked
the door.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXVII. A VERY BRIEF INTERVIEW.
</h2>
<p>
When Jack Massingbred found himself once more &ldquo;in town,&rdquo; and saw that the
tide of the mighty world there rolled on the same full, boiling flood he
had remembered it of yore, he began to wonder where and how he had
latterly been spending his life. There were questions of politics&mdash;mighty
interests of which every one was talking&mdash;of which he knew nothing;
party changes and new social combinations had arisen of which he was
utterly ignorant. But what he still more acutely deplored was that he
himself had, so to say, dropped out of the memory of his friends, who
accosted him with that half-embarrassed air that says, &ldquo;Have you been ill?&mdash;or
in India?&mdash;or how is it that we have n&rsquo;t met you about?&rdquo; It was last
session he had made a flash speech,&mdash;an effort that his own party
extolled to the skies, and even the Opposition could only criticise the
hardihood and presumption of so very young a member of the House,&mdash;and
now already people had ceased to bear him in mind.
</p>
<p>
The least egotistical of men&mdash;and Massingbred did not enter into this
category&mdash;find it occasionally very hard to bear the cool &ldquo;go-by&rdquo; the
world gives them whenever a chance interval has withdrawn them from public
view. The stern truth of how little each atom of the social scheme affects
the working of the whole machinery is far from palatable in its personal
application. Massingbred was probably sensitive enough on this score, but
too consummate a tactician to let any one guess his feelings; and so he
lounged down to the &ldquo;House,&rdquo; and lolled at his Club, and took his airings
in the Park with all the seeming routine of one who had never abdicated
these enjoyments for a day.
</p>
<p>
He had promised, and really meant, to have looked after Martin&rsquo;s affairs
on his reaching London; but it was almost a week after his return that he
bethought him of his pledge, his attention being then called to the
subject by finding on his table the visiting-card of Mr. Maurice Scanlan.
Perhaps he was not sorry to have something to do; perhaps he had some
compunctions of conscience for his forgetfulness; at all events, he sent
his servant at once to Scanlan&rsquo;s hotel, with a request that he would call
upon him as early as might be. An answer was speedily returned that Mr.
Scanlan was about to start for Ireland that same afternoon, but would wait
upon him immediately. The message was scarcely delivered when Scanlan
himself appeared.
</p>
<p>
Dressed in deep mourning, but with an easy complacency of manner that
indicated very little of real grief, he threw himself into a chair,
saying, &ldquo;I pledge you my word of honor, it is only to yourself I &lsquo;d have
come this morning, Mr. Massingbred, for I &lsquo;m actually killed with
business. No man would believe the letters I&rsquo;ve had to read and answer,
the documents to examine, the deeds to compare, the papers to investigate&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is the business settled, then&mdash;or in train of settlement?&rdquo; broke in
Jack.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose it <i>is</i> settled,&rdquo; replied Scanlan, with a slight laugh.
&ldquo;Of course you know Mr. Martin is dead?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dead! Good heavens! When did this occur?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We got the news&mdash;that is, Merl did&mdash;the day before yesterday. A
friend of his who had remained at Baden to watch events started the moment
he breathed his last, and reached town thirty hours before the mail; not,
indeed, that the Captain has yet written a line on the subject to any
one.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what of the arrangement? Had you come to terms previously with Merl?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; he kept negotiating and fencing with us from day to day, now asking
for this, now insisting on that, till the evening of his friend&rsquo;s arrival,
when, by special appointment, I had called to confer with him. Then,
indeed, he showed no disposition for further delay, but frankly told me
the news, and said, &lsquo;The Conferences are over, Scanlan. I &lsquo;m the Lord of
Cro&rsquo; Martin.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And is this actually the case,&mdash;has he really established his claim
in such a manner as will stand the test of law and the courts?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He owns every acre of it; there&rsquo;s not a flaw in his title; he has managed
to make all Martin&rsquo;s debts assume the shape of advances in hard cash.
There is no trace of play transactions throughout the whole. I must be
off, Mr. Massing-bred; there &lsquo;s the chaise now at the door.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wait one moment, I entreat of you. Can nothing be done? Is it too late to
attempt any compromise?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure it is. He has sent off instructions already to serve the
notice for ejectment. I &lsquo;ve got orders myself to warn the tenants not to
pay the last half-year, except into court.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, are <i>you</i> in Mr. Merl&rsquo;s service, then?&rdquo; asked Jack, with one of
his quiet laughs.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am, and I am not,&rdquo; said Scanlan, reddening. &ldquo;You know the compact I
made with Lady Dorothea at Baden. Well, of course there is no longer any
question about that. Still, if Miss Mary agrees to accept me, I &lsquo;ll stand
by the old family! There &lsquo;s no end of trouble and annoyance we could n&rsquo;t
give Merl before he got possession. I know the estate well, and where the
worst fellows on it are to be found! It&rsquo;s one thing to have the parchments
of a property, and it is another to be able to go live on it, and draw the
rents. But I can&rsquo;t stay another minute. Good-bye, air. Any chance of
seeing you in the West soon?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;m not sure I &lsquo;ll not go over to-morrow,&rdquo; said Jack, musing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you are going to blarney the constituency?&rdquo; said Maurice,
laughing heartily at his coarse conceit. Then suddenly seeing that
Massingbred did not seem to relish the freedom, he hurriedly repeated his
leave-takings, and departed.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXVIII. THE DARK SIDE OF A CHARACTER.
</h2>
<p>
&ldquo;Ye might ken the style of these epistles by this time, Dinah,&rdquo; said Mr.
Henderson, as he walked leisurely up and down a long low-ceilinged room,
and addressed himself to a piece of very faded gentility, who sat at a
writing-table. &ldquo;She wants to hear naething but what she likes, and, as
near as may be, in her ain words too.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I always feel as if I was copying out the same letter every time I
write,&rdquo; whined out a weak, sickly voice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The safest thing ye could do,&rdquo; replied he, gravely. &ldquo;She never tires o&rsquo;
reading that everybody on the estate is a fule or a scoundrel, and ye
canna be far wrang when ye say the worst o&rsquo; them all. Hae ye told her
aboot the burnin&rsquo; at Kyle-a-Noe?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I have said that you have little doubt it was malicious.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And hae ye said that there&rsquo;s not a sixpence to be had out of the whole
townland of Kiltimmon?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have. I have told her that, except Miss Mary herself, nobody would
venture into the barony.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The greater fule yerself, then,&rdquo; said he, angrily. &ldquo;Couldna ye see that
she&rsquo;ll score this as a praise o&rsquo; the young leddy&rsquo;s courage? Ye maun just
strike it out, ma&rsquo;am, and say that the place is in open rebellion&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I thought you bade me say that Miss Mary had gone down there and spoken
to the people&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I bade ye say,&rdquo; broke he angrily in, &ldquo;that Miss Mary declared no rent
should be demanded o&rsquo; them in their present distress; that she threw the
warrants into the fire, and vowed that if we called a sale o&rsquo; their
chattels, she &lsquo;d do the same at the castle, and give the people the
proceeds.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You only said that she was in such a passion that she declared she &lsquo;d be
right in doing so.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hae nae time for hair-splitting, ma&rsquo;am. I suppose if she had a right
she &lsquo;d exercise it! Put down the words as I gie them to ye! Ye hae no
forgotten the conspeeracy?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I gave it exactly as you told me, and I copied out the two paragraphs in
the papers about it, beginning, &lsquo;Great scandal,&rsquo; and &lsquo;If our landed gentry
expect&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right; and ye hae added the private history of Joan? They &lsquo;ll make
a fine thing o&rsquo; that on the trial, showing the chosen associate o&rsquo; a young
leddy to hae been naething better than&mdash;Ech! what are ye blubberin&rsquo;
aboot,&mdash;is it yer feelin&rsquo;s agen? Ech! ma&rsquo;am, ye are too sentimental
for a plain man like me!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This rude speech was called up by a smothering effort to conceal emotion,
which would not be repressed, but burst forth in a violent fit of sobbing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know you didn&rsquo;t mean it. I know you were not thinking&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If ye canna keep your ain counsel, ye must just pay the cost o&rsquo; it,&rdquo; said
he, savagely. &ldquo;Finish the letter there, and let me send it to the post. I
wanted ye to say a&rsquo; about the Nelligans comin&rsquo; up to visit Miss Mary, and
she goin&rsquo; ower the grounds wi&rsquo; them, and sendin&rsquo; them pineapples and
grapes, and how that the doctor&rsquo;s girls are a&rsquo;ways wi&rsquo; her, and that she
takes old Catty out to drive along wi&rsquo; herself in the pony phaeton, which
is condescendin&rsquo; in a way her Leddyship will no approve o&rsquo;. There was mony
a thing beside I had in my head, but ye hae driven them a&rsquo; clean awa&rsquo; wi&rsquo;
your feelin&rsquo;s!&rdquo; And he gave the last word with an almost savage severity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bide a wee!&rdquo; cried he, as she was folding up the letter. &ldquo;Ye may add that
Mister Scanlan has taken to shootin&rsquo; over the preserves we were keepin&rsquo;
for the Captain, and if her Leddyship does not wish to banish the
woodcocks a&rsquo;the-gither, she &lsquo;d better gie an order to stop him. Young
Nelli-gan had a special permission from Miss Mary hersel&rsquo; and if it was na
that he canna hit a haystack at twenty yards, there &lsquo;d no be a cock
pheasant in the demesne! I think I &lsquo;m looking at her as she reads this,&rdquo;
 said he, with a malicious grin. &ldquo;Ech, sirs, won&rsquo;t her great black eyebrows
meet on her forehead, and her mouth be drawn in till never a bit of a red
lip be seen! Is na that a chaise I see comin&rsquo; up the road?&rdquo; cried he,
suddenly. &ldquo;Look yonder!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I thought I saw something pass,&rdquo; said she, trying to strain her eyes
through the tears that now rose to them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a post-chaise wi&rsquo; twa trunks on the top. I wonder who&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; in
it?&rdquo; said Henderson, as he opened the sash-door, and stood awaiting the
arrival. The chaise swept rapidly round the beech copse, and drew up
before the door; the postilion, dismounting, lowered the steps, and
assisted a lady to alight. She threw back her veil as she stood on the
ground, and Kate Henderson, somewhat jaded-looking and pale from her
journey, was before her father. A slight flush&mdash;very slight&mdash;rose
to his face as he beheld her, and without uttering a word he turned and
re-entered the house.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ye are aboot to see a visitor, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said he to his wife; and, taking
his hat, passed out of the room. Meanwhile Kate watched the postboy as he
untied the luggage and deposited it at her side.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did n&rsquo;t I rowl you along well, my Lady?&mdash;ten miles in little more
than an hour,&rdquo; said he, pointing to his smoking cattle.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;More speed than we needed,&rdquo; said she, with a melancholy smile, while she
placed some silver in his hand.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this here, my Lady? It&rsquo;s like one of the owld tenpenny bits,&rdquo; said
he, turning over and over a coin as he spoke.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s French money,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and unfortunately I have got none other
left me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sure they&rsquo;ll give you what you want inside,&rdquo; said he, pointing towards
the house.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no; take this. It is a crown piece, and they&rsquo;ll surely change it for
you in the town.&rdquo; And so saying, she turned towards the door. When she
made one step towards it, however, she stopped. A painful irresolution
seemed to possess her; but, recovering it, she turned the handle and
entered.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We did not know you were coming; at least, he never told me,&rdquo; said her
stepmother, in a weak, broken voice, as she arose from her seat.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There was no time to apprise you,&rdquo; said Kate, as she walked towards the
fire and leaned her arm on the chimney-piece.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You came away suddenly, then? Had anything unpleasant&mdash;was there any
reason&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I had been desirous of leaving for some time back. Lady Dorothea only
gave her consent on Tuesday last,&mdash;I think it was Tuesday; but my
head is not very clear, for I am somewhat tired.&rdquo; There was an
indescribable sadness in the way these simple words were uttered and in
the sigh which followed them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;m afraid he &lsquo;ll not be pleased at it!&rdquo; said the other, timidly.
</p>
<p>
Another sigh, but still weaker than the former, was Kate&rsquo;s only reply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And how did you leave Mr. Martin? They tell us here that his case is
hopeless,&rdquo; said Mrs. Henderson.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He is very ill, indeed; the doctors give no hope of saving him. Is Miss
Martin fully aware of his state?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who can tell? We scarcely ever see her. You know that she never was very
partial to your father, and latterly there has been a greater distance
than ever between them. They differ about everything; and with that
independent way he has&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A wide stare from Kate&rsquo;s full dark eyes, an expression of astonishment,
mingled with raillery, in her features, here arrested the speaker, who
blushed deeply in her embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Kate, gently. &ldquo;Pray continue, and let me hear what it is
that his independence accomplishes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; sighed the other. &ldquo;I see well you are not changed, Kate. You
have come back with your old haughty spirit, and sure you know well, dear,
that he &lsquo;ll not bear it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;ll not impose any burden on his forbearance. A few days&rsquo; shelter&mdash;a
week or two at furthest&mdash;will not be, perhaps, too much to ask.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So, then, you have a situation in view, Kate?&rdquo; asked she, more eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The world is a tolerably wide one, and I &lsquo;m sure there is room for me
somewhere, even without displacing another. But let us talk of anything
else. How are the Nelligans? and Joe, what is he doing?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The old people are just as you left them; but Mr. Joseph is a great man
now,&mdash;dines with the Lord-Lieutenant, and goes into all the grand
society of Dublin.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is he spoiled by his elevation?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your father thinks him haughtier than he used to be; but many say that he
is exactly what he always was. Mrs. Nelligan comes up frequently to the
cottage now, and dines with Miss Martin. I &lsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know how my
Lady would like to see her there.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She is not very likely,&rdquo; said Kate, dryly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I mean, that nothing is less probable than Lady Dorothea&rsquo;s return here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose not!&rdquo; half sighed Mrs. Henderson, for hers was one of those
sorrowful temperaments that extract only the bitter from the cup of life.
In reality, she had little reason to wish for Lady Dorothea&rsquo;s presence,
but still she could make a &ldquo;very good grievance&rdquo; out of her absence, and
find it a fitting theme for regret. &ldquo;What reason do you mean to give for
your coming home, Kate, if he should ask you?&rdquo; inquired she, after a
pause.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That I felt dissatisfied with my place,&rdquo; replied Kate, coldly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And we were always saying what a piece of good luck it was for you to be
there! Miss Mary told Mrs. Nelligan&mdash;it was only the other day&mdash;that
her uncle could n&rsquo;t live without you,&mdash;that you nursed him, and read
to him, and what not; and as to her Ladyship, that she never took a drive
in the carriage, or answered a note, without asking your advice first.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What a profound impression Miss Martin must have received of my talents
for intrigue!&rdquo; said Kate, sneeringly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe not. I think she said something very kind and good-natured,
just as if it was only people who had really very great gifts that could
condescend to make themselves subservient without humiliation. I know she
said &lsquo;without humiliation,&rsquo; because your father laughed when he heard of
it, and remarked, &lsquo;If it&rsquo;s Kate&rsquo;s humility they like, they are assuredly
thankful for small mercies!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should like to go over and see Miss Martin. What distance is it from
this to the cottage?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s full three miles; but it&rsquo;s all through the demesne.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a good walker, and I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said she, rising. &ldquo;But first, might I
ask for a little refreshment,&mdash;a cup of tea? Oh, I forgot,&rdquo; added
she, smiling, &ldquo;tea is one of the forbidden luxuries here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; but your father doesn&rsquo;t like to see it in the daytime. If you&rsquo;d take
it in your own room&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course, and be most thankful. Am I to have the little room with the
green paper, where I used to be, long ago?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, indeed, I can scarcely tell. The bed was taken down last autumn;
and as we never thought of your coming home&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Home!&rdquo; sighed Kate, involuntarily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But come into my room, and I &lsquo;ll fetch you a cup of tea directly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no; it is better not to risk offending him,&rdquo; said Kate, calmly. &ldquo;I
remember, now, that this was one of his antipathies. Give me anything
else, for I have not eaten to-day.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
While her stepmother went in search of something to offer her, Kate sat
down beside the fire, deep in thought. She had removed her bonnet, and her
long silky hair fell in rich masses over her neck and shoulders, giving a
more fixed expression to her features, which were of deathlike paleness.
And so she sat, gazing intently on the fire, as though she were reading
her very destiny in the red embers before her. Her preoccupation of mind
was such that she never noticed the opening of the door, nor remarked that
her father had entered. The noise of a chair being moved suddenly startled
her. She looked up, and there he stood, his hat on his head and his arms
closely folded on his breast, at the opposite side of the fire.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, lassie,&rdquo; said he, after a long and steady stare at her, &ldquo;ye hae
left your place, or been turned oot o&rsquo; it,&mdash;whilk is the case?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I came away of my own accord,&rdquo; said she, calmly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And against my Leddy&rsquo;s wish?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, with her full consent.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And how did ye do it? for in her last letter to my sel&rsquo;, she says, &lsquo;I
desire ye, therefore, to bear in mind that any step she takes on this
head&rsquo;&mdash;meaning about going away&mdash;&lsquo;shall have been adopted in
direct opposition to my wishes.&rsquo; What has ye done since that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have succeeded in convincing her Ladyship that I was right in leaving
her!&rdquo; said Kate.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Was it the force of your poleetical convictions that impelled ye to this
course?&rdquo; said he, with a bitter grin, &ldquo;for they tell me ye are a rare
champion o&rsquo; the rights o&rsquo; the people, and scruple not to denounce the
upper classes, while ye eat their bread.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I denounce no one; nor, so far as I know myself, is ingratitude amongst
my faults.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe, if one were to tak&rsquo; your ain narrative for it, ye hae nae faults
worse than mere failings! But this is na telling me why ye left my Leddy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kate made no answer, but sat steadily watching the fire.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ye wad rayther, mayhap, that I asked hersel&rsquo; aboot it! Well, be it so.
And noo comes anither point. Do ye think that if your conduct has in any
way given displeasure to your mistress, or offended those in whose service
ye were,&mdash;do ye think, I say, that ye hae the right to involve <i>me</i>
in your shame and disgrace?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; said she, calmly, &ldquo;that I had no right to come here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It &lsquo;s just exactly what I mean; that if ye canna mak&rsquo; friends for
yoursel&rsquo;, ye ought not to turn away those whilk befriend your family.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But what was I to have done, then?&rdquo; said she, gently. &ldquo;There were
circumstances that required&mdash;imperatively required me&mdash;to leave
Lady Dorothea&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let me hear them,&rdquo; said he, breaking in, &ldquo;It would lead me to speak of
others than myself,&mdash;of events which are purely family matters,&mdash;were
I to enter upon this theme. Besides,&rdquo; said she, rising, &ldquo;I am not, so far
as I know, on my trial. There is not anything laid to my charge. I have no
apologies to render.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
At this moment her stepmother appeared with a tray at the door, and seeing
Henderson, endeavored to retire unobserved, but his quick eye had already
detected her, and he cried out, &ldquo;Come here,&mdash;ye canna do too much
honor to a young leddy who has such a vara profound esteem for hersel&rsquo;!
Cake and wine! my faith! No but ye &lsquo;ll deem it vara vulgar fare, after the
dainties ye hae been used to! And yet, lassie, these are nae the habits
here!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She has eaten nothing to-day!&rdquo; meekly observed her stepmother.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My fayther wad hae askit her hoo much has she earned the day?&rdquo; said
Henderson, severely.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are quite right, sir,&rdquo; broke in Kate,&mdash;&ldquo;I have earned nothing.
Not just yet,&rdquo; added she, as her stepmother pressed a glass of wine on her
acceptance; &ldquo;a little later, perhaps. I have no appetite now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are ye sae stupid, ma&rsquo;am, that ye canna see ye are dealin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; a fine
leddy, wha is no obleeged to hae the same mind twa minutes thegither? Ye
‘ll hae to train wee Janet to be a&rsquo; ready for whate&rsquo;er caprice is
uppermost. But mine me, lassie,&rdquo;&mdash;here he turned a look of stern
meaning towards her,&mdash;&ldquo;ye hae tried for mony a lang day to subdue <i>me</i>
to your whims and fancies, as they tell me ye hae done wi&rsquo; sae mony
others, and ye are just as far fra it noo as the first time ye tried it.
Ye canna cheat nor cajole <i>me! I</i> know ye!&rdquo; And with these words,
uttered in a tone of intense passion, he slowly walked out of the room.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Had he been angry with you?&mdash;had anything occurred before I came
in?&rdquo; asked her stepmother.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very little,&rdquo; sighed Kate, wearily. &ldquo;He was asking me why I came here, I
believe. I could scarcely tell him; perhaps I don&rsquo;t very well know,
myself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t get it out of his head,&rdquo; said the other, in a low, stealthy
whisper, &ldquo;that, if you should leave Lady Dorothea, he will be turned away
out of the stewardship. He is always saying it,&mdash;he repeats it even
in his dreams. But for that, he &lsquo;d not have met you so&mdash;so&mdash;unkindly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kate pressed her hand affectionately, and smiled a thankful acknowledgment
of this speech. &ldquo;And the cottage,&rdquo; said she, rallying suddenly, &ldquo;is about
three miles off?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not more. But you could scarcely walk there and back again. Besides, it
is already growing late, and you have no chance of seeing Miss Mary if you
‘re not there by breakfast-time, since, when she comes home of an evening,
she admits no one. She reads or studies, I believe, all the evening.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;d see me,&rdquo; said Kate; &ldquo;I should have so much to tell her
about her friends. I &lsquo;m sure she &lsquo;d see <i>me</i>,&mdash;at least, I&rsquo;ll
try.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll eat something,&mdash;you &lsquo;ll at least drink a glass of wine
before you set out?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do not like to refuse you,&rdquo; said Kate, smiling good-naturedly, &ldquo;but I
could n&rsquo;t swallow now. I have a choking feeling here in my throat, like a
heavy cold, that seems as though it would suffocate me. Good-bye, for a
while. I shall be quite well, once I &lsquo;m in the open air. Good-bye!&rdquo; And,
so saying, she wrapped her shawl around her, and motioning a farewell with
her hand, set out on her errand.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXIX. THE COTTAGE.
</h2>
<p>
It was one of those fresh and breezy days where brilliant flashes of
sunlight alternate with deep shadow, making of every landscape a
succession of pictures, that Kate Henderson set out on her way to the
cottage. Her path led through the demesne, but it was as wild as any
forest scene in Germany, now wending through dark woods, now issuing forth
over swelling lawns, from which the view extended many a mile away,&mdash;at
one moment displaying the great rugged mountains of Connemara, and at
another, the broad blue sea, heaving heavily, and thundering in sullen
roar against the rocks.
</p>
<p>
The fast-flitting clouds, the breezy grass, the wind-shaken foliage, and
the white-crested waves, all were emblems of life; there was motion and
sound and conflict! and yet to her heart, as she walked along, these
influences imparted no sense of pleasure or relief. For a few seconds,
perhaps, would she suddenly awake to the consciousness of the fair scene
before her, and murmur to herself, perchance, the lines of some favorite
poet; but in another moment her gloomy thoughtfulness was back again, and
with bent-down head was she again moving onward. At times she walked
rapidly forward, and then, relaxing her pace, she would stroll listlessly
along, as though no object engaged her. And so was it in reality,&mdash;her
main desire being to be free, in the open air; to be from beneath that
roof whose shadow seemed to darken her very heart! Could that haughty
spirit have humbled itself in sorrow, she might have found relief; but her
proud nature had no such resource, and in her full heart injury and wrong
had alone their place.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; burst she forth at length,&mdash;&ldquo;and this is Home! this the
dreamland of those far away over the seas,&mdash;the cherished spot of all
affections,&mdash;the quiet nook wherein we breathe an atmosphere of love,
blending our lives with all dearest to us. Is it, then, that all is
hollow, false, and untrue; or is it that I alone have no part in the
happiness that is diffused around me? I know not which would be the
sadder!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Thus, reasoning sadly, she went along, when suddenly, on the slope of a
gentle hill in front of her, gracefully encircled with a young wood of
larch and copper-beech, she caught sight of the cottage. It was a tasteful
imitation of those seen in the Oberland, and with its wild background of
lofty mountain, an appropriate ornament to the landscape.
</p>
<p>
A small stream running over a rocky, broken bed formed the boundary of the
little grounds, and over this a bridge of a single plank conducted the way
to the cottage. The whole was simple and unpretending; there was none of
that smart trimness which gives to such scenes the air of an imitation.
The lawn, it is true, was neatly shaven, and the flower-plots, which broke
its uniformity, clean from weeds; but the flowers were of the simplest
kind,&mdash;the crocus and the daffodil had to stand no dangerous rivalry,
and the hyacinth had nothing to vie with.
</p>
<p>
Kate loitered for some time here, now gazing at the wild, stern landscape,
now listening to the brawling rivulet, whose sounds were the only ones in
the stillness. As she drew nigh the cottage, she found the windows of a
little drawing-room open. She looked in: all was comfortable and
neat-looking, but of the strictest simplicity. She next turned to the
little porch, and pulled the bell; in a few seconds the sounds of feet
were heard approaching, and a very old woman, whose appearance and dress
were the perfection of neatness, appeared.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me, Mrs. Broon?&rdquo; said Kate, gently.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do not, then, my Lady,&rdquo; said she, respectfully, &ldquo;for my eyes is gettin&rsquo;
dimmer every day.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;m Kate Henderson, Mrs. Broon. Do you forget me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed I do not,&rdquo; said Catty, gravely. &ldquo;You were here with the master and
my Lady?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. I went away with them to Germany; but I have come home for a while,
and wish to pay my respects to Miss Mary.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t at home to-day,&rdquo; was the dry response.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But she will return soon, I conclude. She&rsquo;ll be back some time in the
evening, won&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If she plazes it, she will. There&rsquo;s nobody to control or make her do but
what she likes herself,&rdquo; said Catty.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I ask,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;because I&rsquo;m a little tired. I&rsquo;ve come off a long
journey, and if you&rsquo;d allow me to rest myself, and wait awhile in the hope
of seeing Miss Martin, I&rsquo;d be very thankful.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come in, then,&rdquo; said Catty; but the faint sigh with which the words were
uttered, gave but a scant significance of welcome.
</p>
<p>
Kate followed her into the little drawing-room, and at a sign from the old
woman, took a seat.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Miss Mary is quite well, I&rsquo;m glad to hear,&rdquo; said Kate, endeavoring to
introduce some conversation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will they ever come back?&rdquo; asked the old woman, in a stern, harsh voice,
while she paid no attention whatever to Kate&rsquo;s remark.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is very unlikely,&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;Your poor master had not long to live
when I came away. He was sinking rapidly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So I heard,&rdquo; muttered the other, dryly; &ldquo;the last letter from Mr. Repton
said &lsquo;he was n&rsquo;t expected.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I fear it will be a great shock to Miss Mary,&rdquo; said Kate.
</p>
<p>
The old woman nodded her head slowly several times without speaking.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And, perhaps, cause great changes here?&rdquo; continued Kate.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s changes enough, and too many already,&rdquo; muttered Catty. &ldquo;I
remember the place upwards of eighty years. I was born in the little house
to the right of the road as you come up from Kelly&rsquo;s mills. There was no
mill there then, nor a school-house, no, nor a dispensary either! Musha,
but the people was better off, and happier, when they had none of them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kate smiled at the energy with which these words were uttered, surmising,
rightfully, that Catty&rsquo;s condemnation of progress had a direct application
to herself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s all readin&rsquo; and writin&rsquo;, teachin&rsquo; honest people to be rogues,
and givin&rsquo; them new contrivances to cheat their masters. When I knew Cro&rsquo;
Martin first,&rdquo; added she, almost fiercely, &ldquo;there was n&rsquo;t a Scotch steward
on the estate; but there was nobody turned out of his houldin&rsquo;, and there
was n&rsquo;t a cabin unroofed to make the people seek shelter under a ditch.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The world would then seem growing worse every day,&rdquo; remarked Kate,
quietly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure it is. Why would n&rsquo;t it? Money is in every one&rsquo;s heart. Nobody
cares for his own flesh and blood. &lsquo;T is all money! What will I get if I
take that farm over another man&rsquo;s head, or marry that girl that likes
somebody better than me? &lsquo;Tis to be rich they&rsquo;re all strivin&rsquo;, and the
devil never made people his own children so completely as by teachin&rsquo; them
to love goold!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your young mistress has but little of this spirit in her heart?&rdquo; said
Kate.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Signs on it! look at the life she leads: up before daybreak, and away
many times before I &lsquo;m awake. She makes a cup of coffee herself, and
saddles the pony, too, if Patsey is n&rsquo;t there to do it; and she &lsquo;s off to
Glentocher, or Knock-mullen, twelve, fourteen miles down the coast, with
barley for one, and a bottle of wine for the other. Sometimes she has a
basket with her, just a load to carry, with tay and shugar; ay, and&mdash;for
she forgets nothing&mdash;toys for the children, too, and clothes, and
even books. And then to see herself, she &lsquo;s not as well dressed as her own
maid used to be. There &lsquo;s not a night she does n&rsquo;t sit up patchin&rsquo; and
piecin&rsquo; her clothes. &lsquo;T is Billy at the cross-roads made her shoes last
time for her, just because he was starvin&rsquo; with nothing&rsquo; to do. She
ordered them, and she wears them, too; it makes him so proud, she says, to
see them. And this is the niece of the Martins of Cro&rsquo; Martin! without one
of her kith or kin to welcome her home at nightfall,&mdash;without father
or mother, brother or sister,&mdash;without a kind voice to say &lsquo;God bless
her,&rsquo; as she falls off to sleep many a time in that big chair there; and I
take off her shoes without her knowin&rsquo; it, she does be so weary and tired;
and in her dhrames it &lsquo;s always talking to the people, givin&rsquo; them
courage, and cheerin&rsquo; them up, tellin&rsquo; them there &lsquo;s good times for every
one; and once, the other evenin&rsquo;, she sang a bit of a song, thinkin&rsquo; she
was in Mat Leahy&rsquo;s cabin amusin&rsquo; the children, and she woke up laughin&rsquo;,
and said, &lsquo;Catty, I &lsquo;ve had such a pleasant dhrame. I thought I had little
Nora, my godchild, on my knee, and was teachin&rsquo; her &ldquo;Why are the daisies
in the grass?&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t tell you how happy I felt!&rsquo; There it was: the only
thing like company to her poor heart was a dhrame!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do not wonder that you love her, Catty,&rdquo; said Kate; and the words fell
tremulously from her lips.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Love her! what&rsquo;s the use of such as me lovin&rsquo; her?&rdquo; cried the old woman,
querulously. &ldquo;Sure, it&rsquo;s not one of my kind knows how good she is! If you
only seen her comin&rsquo; in here, after dark, maybe, wet and weary and
footsore, half famished with cold and hunger,&mdash;out the whole livelong
day, over the mountains, where there was fever and shakin&rsquo; ague, and
starvin&rsquo; people, ravin&rsquo; mad between disease and destitution; and the first
word out of her mouth will be, &lsquo;Oh, Catty, how grateful you and I ought to
be with our warm roof over us, and our snug fire to sit at,&rsquo; never
thinkin&rsquo; of who she is and what she has the right to, but just makin&rsquo;
herself the same as <i>me</i>. And then she &lsquo;d tell me where she was, and
what she seen, and how well the people was bearin&rsquo; up under their trials,&mdash;all
the things they said to her, for they &lsquo;d tell her things they would n&rsquo;t
tell the priest. &lsquo;Catty,&rsquo; said she, t&rsquo; other night, &lsquo;it looks like
heartlessness in me to be in such high spirits in the midst of all this
misery here; but I feel as if my courage was a well that others were
drinking out of; and when I go into a cabin, the sick man, as he turns his
head round, looks happier, and I feel as if it was my spirit that was
warmin&rsquo; and cheerin&rsquo; him; and when a poor sick sufferin&rsquo; child looks up at
me and smiles, I &lsquo;m ready to drop on my knees and thank God in
gratitude.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kate covered her face with her hands, and never spoke; and now the old
woman, warming with the theme she loved best, went on to tell various
incidents and events of Mary&rsquo;s life,&mdash;the perilous accidents which
befell her, the dangers she braved, the fatigues she encountered. Even
recounted by <i>her</i>, there was a strange adventurous character that
ran through these recitals, showing that Mary Martin, in all she thought
and said and acted, was buoyed and sustained by a sort of native chivalry
that made her actually court the incidents where she incurred the greatest
hazard. It was plain to see what charm such traits possessed for her who
recorded them, and how in her old Celtic blood ran the strong current of
delight in all that pertained to the adventurous and the wild.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis her own father&rsquo;s nature is strong in her,&rdquo; said Catty, with
enthusiasm. &ldquo;Show him the horse that nobody could back, tell him of a
storm where no fisherman would launch his boat, point out a cliff that no
man could climb, and let me see who &lsquo;d hould him! She &lsquo;s so like him, that
when there &lsquo;s anything daring to be done you would n&rsquo;t know her voice from
his own. There, now, I hear her without,&rdquo; cried the old woman, as, rising
suddenly, she approached the window. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear something?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing but the wind through the trees,&rdquo; said Kate.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, but <i>I</i> did, and my ears are older than yours. She&rsquo;s riding
through the river now; I hear the water splashin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kate tried to catch the sounds, but could not; she walked out upon the
lawn to listen, but except the brawling of the stream among the rocks,
there was nothing to be heard.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo; ye see her comin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Catty, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No. Your ears must have deceived you. There is no one coming.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I heard her voice, as I hear yours now. I heard her spake to the mare, as
she always does when she &lsquo;s plungin&rsquo; into the river. There, now, don&rsquo;t you
hear that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hear nothing, I assure you, my dear Mrs. Broon. It is your own anxiety
that is misleading you; but if you like, I &lsquo;ll go down towards the river
and see.&rdquo; And without waiting for a reply Kate hastened down the slope. As
she went, she could not help reflecting over the superstition which
attaches so much importance to these delusions, giving them the character
of actual warnings. It was doubtless from the mind dwelling so forcibly on
Miss Martin&rsquo;s perilous life that the old woman&rsquo;s apprehensions had assumed
this palpable form, and thus invented the very images which should react
upon her with terror.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just as I thought,&rdquo; cried Kate, as she stood on the bank of the stream;
&ldquo;all silent and deserted, no one within sight.&rdquo; And slowly she retraced
her steps towards the cottage. The old woman stood at the door, pale and
trembling; an attempt to smile was on her features, but her heart denied
the courage of the effort.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where is she now?&rdquo; cried Catty, wildly. &ldquo;She rang the bell this minute,
and I heerd the mare trottin&rsquo; round to the stable by herself, as she
always does. But where &lsquo;s Miss Mary?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Broon,&rdquo; said Kate, in her kindest accents, &ldquo;it is just as I
told you. Your mind is anxious and uneasy about Miss Martin; you are
unhappy at her absence, and you think at every stir you hear her coming;
but I have been to the river-side, and there is no one there. I &lsquo;ll go
round to the stables, if you wish it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There &lsquo;s no tracks of a hoof on the gravel,&rdquo; muttered the old woman, in a
broken voice; &ldquo;there was nobody here!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So I said,&rdquo; replied Kate. &ldquo;It was a mere delusion,&mdash;a fancy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A delusion,&mdash;a fancy!&rdquo; cried Catty, scornfully; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the way they
always spake of whatever they don&rsquo;t understand. It&rsquo;s easier to say that
than confess you don&rsquo;t see how to explain a thing; but I heerd the same
sounds before you came to-day; ay, and I went down to see why she was n&rsquo;t
comin&rsquo;, and at the pool there was bubbles and froth on the water, just as
if a baste had passed through, but no livin&rsquo; thing to be seen. Was n&rsquo;t
that a delusion, too?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;An accident, perchance. Only think, what lives of misery we should lead
were we ever tracing our own fears, and connecting them with all the
changes that go on around us!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s two days she&rsquo;s away, now,&rdquo; muttered the old woman, who only heeded
her own thoughts; &ldquo;she was to be back last night, or early this mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where had she gone to?&rdquo; asked Kate, who now saw that the other had lapsed
into confidence.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone to the islands!&mdash;to Innishmore, and maybe, on to
Brannock!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a long way out to sea,&rdquo; said Kate, thoughtfully; &ldquo;but still, the
weather is fine, and the day favorable. Had she any other object than
pleasure in this excursion?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pleasure is it?&rdquo; croaked Catty. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis much pleasure she does be given
herself! Her pleasure is to be where there &lsquo;s fever and want,&mdash;in the
lonely cabin, where the sick is lyin&rsquo;! It &lsquo;s to find a poor crayture that
run away from home she &lsquo;s gone now,&mdash;one Joan Landy. She&rsquo;s missin&rsquo;
this two months, and nobody knows where she &lsquo;s gone to! and Miss Mary got
so uneasy at last that she could n&rsquo;t sleep by night nor rest by day,&mdash;always
talkin&rsquo; about her, and say in&rsquo; as much as it was all her fault; as if <i>she</i>
could know why she went, or where?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did she go alone on this errand, then?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure she did. Who could she have with her? She towld Loony she &lsquo;d
want the boat with four men in it, and maybe to stay out three days, for
she &lsquo;d go to all the islands before she came back.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Loony &lsquo;s the best sailor on the coast, I &lsquo;ve heard; and with such weather
as this there is no cause for alarm.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Catty did not seem to heed the remark; she felt that within her against
which the words of consolation availed but little, and she sat brooding
sorrowfully and in silence.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The night will soon be fallin&rsquo; now,&rdquo; said she, at last. &ldquo;I hope she&rsquo;s not
at sea!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In spite of herself, Kate Henderson caught the contagion of the old
woman&rsquo;s terrors, and felt a dreamy, undefined dread of coming evil. As she
looked out, however, at the calm and fair landscape, which, as day
declined, grew each moment more still, she rallied from the gloomy
thoughts, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;I wish I knew how to be of any service to you,
Mrs. Broon. If you could think of anything I could do&mdash;anywhere I
could go&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped suddenly at a gesture from the old woman,
who, lifting her hand to impress silence, stood a perfect picture of eager
anxiety to hear. Bending down her head, old Catty stood for several
seconds motionless.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ye hear it now?&rdquo; broke she in. &ldquo;Listen! I thought I heerd something
like a wailin&rsquo; sound far off, but it is the wind. See how the tree-tops
are bendin&rsquo;!&mdash;That&rsquo;s three times I heerd it now,&rdquo; said Catty. &ldquo;If ye
live to be as old as me, you &lsquo;ll not think light of a warnin&rsquo;. You think
your hearin&rsquo; better because you&rsquo;re younger; but I tell you that there &lsquo;s
sounds that only reach ears that are goin&rsquo; to where the voices came from.
When eyes grow dim to sights of this world, they are strainin&rsquo; to catch a
glimpse of them that&rsquo;s beyond it.&rdquo; Although no tears rose to her eyes, the
withered face trembled in her agony, and her clasped hands shook in the
suffering of her sorrow.
</p>
<p>
Against impressions of this sort, Kate knew well enough how little
reasoning availed, and she forbore to press arguments which she was aware
would be unsuccessful. She tried, however, to turn the current of the old
woman&rsquo;s thoughts, by leading her to speak of the condition of the country
and the state of the people. Catty gave short, abrupt, and unwilling
answers to all she asked, and Kate at length arose to take her leave.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; away, are ye?&rdquo; said Catty, half angrily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have only just remembered that I have a long way to walk, and it is
already growing late.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, and ye &lsquo;re impatient to be back again, at home, beside your own fire,
with your own people. But <i>she</i> has no home, and her own has deserted
her!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mine has not many charms for me!&rdquo; muttered Kate to herself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s happy for you that has father and mother,&rdquo; went on the old woman.
&ldquo;Them &lsquo;s the only ones, after all!&mdash;the only ones that never loves
the less, the less we desarve it! I don&rsquo;t wonder ye came back again!&rdquo; And
in a sort of envious bitterness Catty wished her a good-night.
</p>
<p>
If the distance she had to walk was not shortened by the tenor of her
thoughts, as little did she feel impatient to press onward. Dreary and sad
enough were her reveries. Of the wild visionary ambitions which once had
stirred her heart, there remained nothing but disappointments. She had but
passed the threshold of life to find all dreary and desolate; but perhaps
the most painful feeling of the moment was the fact that now pressed
conviction on her, and told that in the humble career of such a one as
Mary Martin there lay a nobler heroism and a higher devotion than in the
most soaring path of political ambition, and that all the theorizing as to
popular rights made but a sorry figure beside the actual benefits
conferred by one true-hearted lover of her kind. &ldquo;She is right, and I am
wrong!&rdquo; muttered she to herself. &ldquo;In declining to entertain questions of
statecraft she showed herself above, and not beneath, the proud position
she had taken. The very lowliness of this task is its glory. Oh, if I
could but win her confidence and be associated in such a labor! and yet my
very birth denies me the prestige that hers confers.&rdquo; And then she thought
of home, and all the coldness of that cheerless greeting smote upon her
heart.
</p>
<p>
The moon was up ere Kate arrived at her father&rsquo;s door. She tapped at it
gently, almost timidly. Her stepmother, as if expecting her, came quickly,
and in a low, cautious whisper told her that she would find her supper
ready in her bedroom.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To-morrow, perhaps, he may be in better humor or better spirits.
Good-night.&rdquo; And so Kate silently stole along to her room, her proud heart
swelling painfully, and her tearless eye burning with all the heat of a
burning brain.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXX. &ldquo;A TEA-PARTY&rdquo; AT MRS. CRONAN&rsquo;S
</h2>
<p>
Once more, but for the last time, we are at Kilkieran. To a dreary day of
incessant rain succeeded an evening still drearier. Wild gusts swept along
the little shore, and shook the frail windows and ill-fitting doors of the
cottages, while foam and sea-drift were wafted over the roofs, settling
like snow-flakes on the tall cliffs above them. And yet it was midsummer!
By the almanac the time was vouched to be the opening of the season; a
fact amply corroborated by the fashionable assemblage then enjoying the
hospitalities of Mrs. Cronan&rsquo;s tea-table. There they were, with a single
exception, the same goodly company already presented to the reader in an
early chapter of our story. We have already mentioned the great changes
which time had worked in the appearance of the little watering-place. The
fostering care of proprietorship withdrawn, the ornamental villa of the
Martins converted into a miserable village inn, the works of the pier and
harbor suspended, and presenting in their unfinished aspect the dreary
semblance of ruin and decay,&mdash;all conspired with the falling fortunes
of the people to make the scene a sad one. Little evidence of this
decline, however, could be traced in the aspect of that pleasant
gathering, animated with all its ancient taste for whist, scandal, and
shrimps; their appetite for such luxuries seeming rather to have increased
than diminished by years. Not that we presume to say they could claim any
immunity against the irrevocable decrees of age. Unhappily, the confession
may be deemed not exactly in accordance with gallantry; but it is strictly
true, time had no more forgotten the living than the inanimate accessories
of the picture. Miss Busk, of the Emporium, had grown more sour and more
stately. The vinegar of her temperament was verging upon verjuice, and the
ill opinion of mankind experience enforced had written itself very legibly
on her features. The world had not improved upon her by acquaintance. Not
so Captain Bodkin; fatter and more wheezy than ever, he seemed to relish
life rather more than when younger. He had given up, too, that long
struggle with himself about bathing, and making up his mind to suffer no
&ldquo;sea-change;&rdquo; he was, therefore, more cheerful than before.
</p>
<p>
As for Mrs. Cronan, &ldquo;the little comforts she was used to&rdquo; had sorely
diminished by the pressure of the times, and, in consequence, she drew
unlimited drafts upon the past to fill up the deficiencies of the present.
Strange enough is it, that the faults and follies of society are just as
adhesive ingredients as its higher qualities! These people had grown so
used to each other in all their eccentric ways and oddities, that they had
become fond of them; like a pilot long accustomed to rocks and sandbanks,
they could only steer their course where there was something to avoid!
</p>
<p>
The remainder of the goodly company had grown stouter or thinner, jollier
or more peevish, as temperament inclined; for it is with human nature as
with wine: if the liquor does not get racier with years, it degenerates
sadly.
</p>
<p>
The first act of the whist and backgammon playing was over, and the party
now sat, stood, crouched, lounged, or lay, as chance and the state of the
furniture permitted, at supper. At the grand table, of course, were the
higher dignitaries, such as Father Maher, the Captain, Miss Busk, and Mrs.
Clinch; but cockles were eaten, and punch discussed in various very odd
quarters; bursts of joyous laughter, too, came from dark pantries, and
sounds of merriment mingled with the jangling crash of kitchen utensils.
Reputations were roasted and pancakes fried, characters and chickens alike
mangled, and all the hubbub of a festival prevailed in a scene where the
efforts of the fair hostess were directed to produce an air of unblemished
elegance and gentility.
</p>
<p>
Poor Clinch, the revenue officer, who invariably eat what he called &ldquo;his
bit&rdquo; in some obscure quarter, alone and companionless, was twice &ldquo;had up&rdquo;
 before the authorities for the row and uproar that prevailed, and
underwent a severe cross-examination, &ldquo;as to where he was when Miss
Cullenane was making the salad,&rdquo; and, indeed, cut a very sorry figure at
the conclusion of the inquiry. All the gayeties and gravities of the
scene, however, gradually toned down as the serious debate of the evening
came on; which was no other than the lamentable condition of the prospects
of Kilkieran, and the unanimous opinion of the ruinous consequences that
must ensue from the absence of the proprietor.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We &lsquo;ve little chance of getting up the news-room now,&rdquo; said the Captain.
&ldquo;The Martins won&rsquo;t give a sixpence for anything.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is something to give trade an impulse we want, sir,&rdquo; broke in Miss
Busk,&mdash;&ldquo;balls and assemblies; evening reunions of the <i>élite</i> of
society, where the elegance of the toilet should rival the <i>distingué</i>
air of the company.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s word for word out of the &lsquo;Intelligence,&rsquo;&rdquo; cried the Captain. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
unparliamentary to quote the newspapers.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I detest the newspapers,&rdquo; broke in Miss Busk, angrily; &ldquo;after advertising
the Emporium for two seasons in the &lsquo;Galway Celt,&rsquo; they gave me a leading
article beginning, &lsquo;As the hot weather is now commencing, and the season
for fashion approaches, we cannot better serve the interests of our
readers than by directing attention to the elegant &ldquo;Symposium!&rdquo;&rsquo;
‘Symposium!&rsquo;&mdash;I give you my word of honor that&rsquo;s what they put it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;On my conscience! it might have been worse,&rdquo; chuckled out the Captain.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was young Nelligan explained to me what it was,&rdquo; resumed Miss Busk;
&ldquo;and Scanlan said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d have an action against them for damages.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Keep out of law, my dear!&mdash;keep out of law!&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Cronan.
&ldquo;See to what it has reduced me! I, that used to go out in my own coach,
with two men in green and gold; that had my house in town, and my house in
the country; that had gems and ornaments such as a queen might wear! And
there&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s left me now!&rdquo; And she pointed to a brooch about the
size of a cheese-plate, where a melancholy gentleman in uniform was
represented, with a border of mock pearls around him. &ldquo;The last pledge of
affection!&rdquo; sobbed she.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course you wouldn&rsquo;t pledge it, my dear,&rdquo; muttered the deaf old Mrs.
Few; &ldquo;and they&rsquo;d give you next to nothing on it, besides.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>

</div>
<p>
&ldquo;We &lsquo;ll have law enough here soon, it seems,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cronan, angrily;
for the laugh this blunder excited was by no means flattering and
pleasant. &ldquo;There &lsquo;s Magennis&rsquo;s action first for trial at the Assizes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That will be worth hearing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clinch. &ldquo;They &lsquo;ll have the first
lawyers from Dublin on each side.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did you hear the trick they played off on Joe Nelligan about it?&rdquo; asked
the Captain. &ldquo;It was cleverly done. Magennis found out, some way or other,
that Joe wanted to be engaged against him; and so what does he do but gets
a servant dressed up in the Martin livery, and sends him to Joe&rsquo;s house on
the box of a coach, inside of which was a gentleman that begged a word
with the Counsellor. &lsquo;You &lsquo;re not engaged, I hope, Counsellor Nelligan,&rsquo;
says he, &lsquo;in Magennis against Martin?&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; says Joe, for he caught a
glimpse of the livery. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re quite free?&rsquo; says the other. &lsquo;Quite free,&rsquo;
says he. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all I want, then,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;here&rsquo;s your brief, and
here&rsquo;s your retainer;&rsquo; and he put both down on the table, and when Joe
looked down he saw he was booked for Magennis. You may imagine how he
felt; but he never uttered a word, for there was no help for it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And do you mean to tell me,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Clinch, &ldquo;that the lawyers can&rsquo;t
help themselves, but must just talk and rant and swear for any one that
asks them first?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s exactly what I mean, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; responded the Captain. &ldquo;They &lsquo;ve no
more choice in the matter than the hangman has as to who be &lsquo;ll hang.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d as soon be a gauger!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady, with a contemptuous
glance at poor Clinch, who winced under the observation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see what they wanted young Nelligan for,&rdquo; said Miss Busk;
&ldquo;what experience or knowledge has <i>he?</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just the first man of the day,&rdquo; said Bodkin. &ldquo;They tell me that
whether it be to crook out a flaw in the enemy&rsquo;s case, to pick a hole in a
statement, to crush a witness, or cajole the jury, old Repton himself is
n&rsquo;t his equal.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose, from the airs he gives himself, he must be something
wonderful,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cronan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, now, I differ from you there, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Bodkin. &ldquo;I think Joe
is just what he always was. He was cold, silent, and distant as a boy, and
he &lsquo;s the same as a man. Look at him when he comes down here at the
Assizes, down to the town where his father is selling glue and hides and
tenpenny-nails, and he &lsquo;s just as easy and unconstrained as if the old man
was Lord of Cro&rsquo; Martin Castle.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the height of impertinence,&rdquo; broke in Miss Busk; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only real
blood has any right to rise above the depreciating accidents of condition.
I know it by myself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I wonder what he &lsquo;ll make of this case, anyhow,&rdquo; said feodkin, to
escape a controversy he had no fancy for. &ldquo;They tell me that no action can
lie on it. It&rsquo;s not abduction&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;For shame, Captain; you forget there are ladies here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clinch.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; sighed he, with a half-comic melancholy in his look.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you how they do it, sir,&rdquo; chimed in Father Maher. &ldquo;Whenever
there &lsquo;s anything in law that never was foreseen or provided for, against
which there is neither act nor statute, they &lsquo;ve one grand and unfailing
resource,&mdash;they charge it as a conspiracy. I &lsquo;ve a brother an
attorney, and he tells me that there is n&rsquo;t a man, woman, or child in the
kingdom but could be indicted for doing something by a conspiracy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great comfort to know that,&rdquo; said Bodkin, gravely.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what can they do to her if she&rsquo;s found guilty?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Cronan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Make her smart for the damages, ma&rsquo;am; leave her something less to expend
on perversion and interference with the people,&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;The
parish isn&rsquo;t the same since she began visiting this one and reading to
that. Instead of respect and confidence in their spiritual guides, the
people are running after a young girl with a head full of wild schemes and
contrivances. We all know by this time how these things end, and the best
receipt to make a Protestant begins, &lsquo;First starve your Papist.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I rise to order,&rdquo; called out Bodkin. &ldquo;We agreed we&rsquo;d have no polemics nor
party discussions.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why am I appealed to, then, for explanations that involve them?&rdquo; cried
the priest, angrily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m supported, too, in my observations by a witness
none will dispute,&mdash;that Scotchman, Henderson&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;By the way, isn&rsquo;t his daughter come home to him?&rdquo; asked Bodkin, eager for
a diversion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed she is, sir; and a pretty story there is about it, too. Miss Busk
knows it all,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cronan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have it in confidence, ma&rsquo;am, from Jemima Davis,&mdash;Lady Dorothea&rsquo;s
second maid; but I don&rsquo;t think it a fit subject for public conversation.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And ain&rsquo;t we in committee here?&rdquo; chimed in Bodkin; &ldquo;have we any secrets
from each other?&rdquo; The racy laugh of the old fellow, as he threw a knowing
glance around the table, rather disconcerted the company. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear
about Henderson&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The story is soon told, sir. Lady Dorothea detected her endeavoring to
draw young Martin into a private marriage. The artful creature, by some
means or other, had obtained such an insight into the young man&rsquo;s
difficulties that she actually terrorized over his weak mind. She
discovered, too, it is suspected, something rather more than indiscretions
on his part.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A long low whistle from the priest seemed to impart a kind of gratified
surprise at this announcement.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He had got into a habit of signing his name, they say; and whether he
signed it to something he had no right to, or signed another name by
mistake&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, for shame,&rdquo; broke in Bodkin; &ldquo;that wouldn&rsquo;t be one bit like a
Martin.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps you are acquainted with all the circumstances better than myself,
sir?&rdquo; said Miss Busk, bristling up with anger. &ldquo;Maybe you &lsquo;ve heard how
the Henderson girl was turned away out of the French duke&rsquo;s family,&mdash;how
she was found in correspondence with the leaders of the mob in Paris?
Maybe, sir, you are aware that she has some mysterious hold over her
father, and he dares not gainsay one word she says?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know one word of it; and if it wasn&rsquo;t thought rude, I&rsquo;d say I
don&rsquo;t believe it, either,&rdquo; said Bodkin, stoutly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe the worst that could be said of her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clinch.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, make her as bad as you like; but how does that prove anything
against young Martin? and if you can find nothing heavier to say of him
than that he wanted to marry a very handsome girl&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A low creature!&rdquo; broke in Miss Busk.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The lowest of the low!&rdquo; chimed in Mrs. Cronan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;An impudent, upsetting minx!&rdquo; added Mrs. Clinch. &ldquo;Nothing would serve her
but a post-chaise the morning she arrived by the mail for Dublin; and,
signs on it, when she got home she had n&rsquo;t money to pay for it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was n&rsquo;t that she left her place empty-handed, then,&rdquo; said Miss Busk.
&ldquo;Jemima tells me that she managed the whole house,&mdash;paid for
everything; and we all know what comes of that.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Miss Busk, in delivering this sentiment, was seated with her back to the
door, towards which suddenly every eye was now turned in mingled
astonishment and confusion; she moved round to see the cause, and there
beheld the very object of her commentary standing close behind her chair.
Closely wrapped in a large cloak, the hood of which she wore over her
head, her tall figure looked taller and more imposing in its motionless
attitude.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have to ask pardon for this intrusion, ladies,&rdquo; said she, calmly; &ldquo;but
you will forgive me when I tell the reason of it. I have just received
very sad tidings, which ought to be conveyed to Miss Martin; she is at the
islands, and I have no means of following her, unless Mr. Clinch will
kindly lend me the revenue boat&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And accompany you, I hope,&rdquo; broke in Mrs. Clinch, with a sneer.
</p>
<p>
Kate did not notice the taunting remark, but went on, &ldquo;You will be grieved
to hear that Mr. Martin is no more.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Martin dead!&rdquo; muttered the Captain.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dead! When did he die?&rdquo; &ldquo;Where did it happen?&rdquo; &ldquo;How?&rdquo; &ldquo;Of what malady?&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Are his remains coming home?&rdquo; were asked in quick succession by several
voices.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;This letter will tell you all that I know myself,&rdquo; said she, laying it on
the table. &ldquo;May I venture to hope Mr. Clinch will so far oblige me? The
fishermen say the sea is too rough for their craft.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not exactly on the King&rsquo;s service, I opine, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; broke in Mrs.
Clinch; &ldquo;but of course he is too gallant to oppose your wishes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faith! if you wanted any one with you, and would accept of myself,&rdquo; broke
in Bodkin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready this minute; not that exactly salt water is my
element.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The young lady is accustomed to travel alone, or she is much belied,&rdquo;
 said Miss Busk, with a sneer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;d better let her have the boat, Clinch,&rdquo; said his wife, in
a whisper. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no knowing what might come of it if you refused.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;ll go down and muster the crew for you, Miss Henderson,&rdquo; said Clinch,
not sorry to escape, although the exchange was from a warm cabin to the
beating rain without.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor Martin!&rdquo; sighed Bodkin; &ldquo;he was the first of the family for many a
long year that did n&rsquo;t breathe his last under his own roof. I &lsquo;m sure it
weighed heavily on him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I trust his son will follow his example, nevertheless,&rdquo; said the priest.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see one of the name amongst us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You might have worse, Father Maher,&rdquo; said Bodkin, angrily.
</p>
<p>
And now a lively discussion ensued as to the merits of him they had lost,
for the most part with more of charity than many of their dissertations;
from this they branched off into speculations about the future. Would the
&ldquo;present man&rdquo; reside at home? would her Ladyship come back? what would be
Mary&rsquo;s position? how would Scanlan fare? what of Henderson, too? In fact,
casualties of every kind were debated, and difficulties started, that they
might be as readily reconciled. Meanwhile Kate was hastening down to the
shore, followed, rather than escorted, by little Clinch, who even in the
darkness felt that the conjugal eye was upon him.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXXI. THE BRANNOCK ISLANDS
</h2>
<p>
A little to the northwest of the island of Innishmore are scattered a
number of small islets, some scarcely more than barren rocks, called the
Brannocks. One of these alone was inhabited, and that by a single family.
No isolation could be more complete than that of these poor people, who
thus dwelt amid the wide waste of waters, never seeing the face of a
stranger, and only at long intervals visiting the mainland. Indeed the
only intercourse they could be said to maintain with their fellow-men was
when by chance they fell in with some homeward-bound ship at sea, and sold
the little produce of their nets; for they lived by fishing, and had no
other subsistence.
</p>
<p>
The largest of these islands was called &ldquo;Brannock-buoy,&rdquo; or the Yellow
Brannock, from the flower of a kind of crocus which grew profusely over
it. It was a wild, desolate spot, scarcely rising above the waves around
it, save in one quarter, where a massive column of rock rose to the height
of several hundred feet, and formed the only shelter against the swooping
wind, which came without break or hindrance from the far-away shores of
Labrador. At the foot of this strong barrier&mdash;so small and
insignificant as to escape notice from the sea&mdash;stood the little
cabin of Owen Joyce. Built in a circular form, the chimney in the middle,
the rude structure resembled some wigwam of the prairies rather than the
home of civilized beings.
</p>
<p>
Certain low partitions within subdivided the space into different
chambers, making the centre the common apartment of the family, where they
cooked and ate and chatted; for, with all their poverty and privation,
theirs was a life not devoid of its own happiness, nor did they believe
that their lot was one to repine at.
</p>
<p>
Seasons of unprofitable labor, years of more or less pressure, they had
indeed experienced, but actual want had never visited them; sickness, too,
was almost as rare. Owen Joyce was, at the time we speak of, upwards of
eighty; and although his hair was white as snow, his cheek was ruddy, his
white teeth were perfect, and his eye&mdash;like that of Moses&mdash;&ldquo;was
not dim.&rdquo; Surrounded by his children and grandchildren, the old man lived
happy and contented, his daily teaching being to impress upon them the
blessings they derived from a life so sheltered from all the accidents of
fortune; to have, as he called the island, &ldquo;the little craft all their
own.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The traits of race and family, the limited range of their intercourse with
the world, served to make them all wonderfully alike, not only in feature
but expression; so that even the youngest child had something of the calm,
steadfast look which characterized the old man. The jet-black hair and
eyes and the swarthy skin seemed to indicate a Spanish origin, and gave
them a type perfectly distinctive and peculiar.
</p>
<p>
In the midst of them moved one who, though dressed in the light-blue
woollen kirtle, the favorite costume of the islands, bore in her fresh
bright features the traces of a different blood; her deep blue eye, soft
and almost sleepy, her full, well-curved lips, were strong contrasts to
the traits around her. The most passing glance would have detected that
she was not &ldquo;one of them,&rdquo; nor had she been long an inmate of this
dwelling.
</p>
<p>
It chanced that some short time before, one of Joyce&rsquo;s sons, in boarding
an outward-bound American ship, had heard of a young countrywoman who,
having taken her passage for New York, no sooner found herself at sea&mdash;parted,
as she deemed it, forever from home and country&mdash;than she gave way to
the most violent grief; so poignant, indeed, was her sorrow that the
captain compassionately offered to relinquish her passage-money if Joyce
would take charge of her, and re-land her on the shores of Ireland. The
offer was accepted, and the same evening saw her safely deposited on the
rocky island of Brannock. Partly in gratitude to her deliverer, partly in
the indulgence of a secret wish, she asked leave to remain with them and
be their servant; the compact was agreed to, and thus was she there.
</p>
<p>
Theirs was not a life to engender the suspicions and distrusts which are
current in the busier walks of men. None asked her a reason for her
self-banishment, none inquired whether the cause of her exile was crime or
misfortune. They had grown to feel attachment to her for the qualities of
her gentle, quiet nature, a mild submissive temper, and a disposition to
oblige, that forgot nothing save herself. Her habits had taught her
resources and ways which their isolated existence had denied them, and she
made herself useful by various arts, which, simple as they were, seemed
marvellous to the apprehension of her hosts; and thus, day by day, gaining
on their love and esteem, they came at length to regard her with an
affection mingled with a sort of homage.
</p>
<p>
Poor Joan Landy&mdash;for we have not to explain that it was she&mdash;was
happy,&mdash;happier than ever she had been before. The one great sorrow
of her life was, it is true, treasured in her heart; her lost home, her
blighted hope, her severed affection&mdash;for she actually loved Magennis&mdash;were
griefs over which she wept many an hour in secret; but there was a sense
of duty, a conscious feeling of rectitude, that supported her in her
sacrifice, and as she thought of her old grandfather&rsquo;s death-bed, she
could say to her heart, &ldquo;I have been true to my word with him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The unbroken quiet, the unchanging character of the life she led,&mdash;its
very duties following a routine that nothing ever disturbed,&mdash;gave
her ample time for thought; and thought, though tinged with melancholy,
has its own store of consolation; and if poor Joan sorrowed, she sorrowed
like one who rather deplored the past than desired to re-live it! As time
wore on, a dreamy indistinctness seemed to spread itself over the memory
of her former life: it appeared little other than a mind-drawn picture.
Nothing actual or tangible remained to convince her of its reality. It was
only at rare intervals, and in the very clearest weather, the outline of
the mountains of the mainland could be seen; and when she did behold them,
they brought only some vague recollection to her; and so, too, the
memories of her once home came through the haze of distance, dim and
indistinct.
</p>
<p>
It was at the close of a day in June that the Joyces sat in front of the
little cabin, repairing their nets, and getting their tackle in readiness
for the sea. For some time previous the weather had been broken and
unfavorable. Strong west winds and heavy seas&mdash;far from infrequent in
these regions, even in midsummer&mdash;had rendered fishing impracticable;
but now the aspect of a new moon, rising full an hour before sunset, gave
promise of better, and old Joyce had got the launch drawn up on shore to
refit, and sails were spread out upon the rocks to dry, and coils of rope,
and anchors, and loose spars littered the little space before the door.
The scene was a busy and not an unpicturesque one. There was every age,
from the oldest to very infancy, all active, all employed. Some were
calking the seams of the boat, others overhauled sails and cordage; some
were preparing the nets, attaching cork floats or sinkers; and two chubby
urchins, mere infants, laughing, fed the fire that blazed beneath a large
pitch-pot, the light blue smoke rising calmly into the air, and telling
those far away that the lone rock was not without inhabitants. To all
seeming, these signs of life and habitation bad attracted notice; for a
small boat which had quitted Innishmore for the mainland some time before,
now altered her course, and was seen slowly bearing up towards the
Brannocks. Though the sea was calm and waveless, the wind was only
sufficient to waft her along at the slowest rate; a twinkling flash of the
sea at intervals showed, however, that her crew were rowing, and at length
the measured beat of the oars could be distinctly heard.
</p>
<p>
Many were the speculations of those who watched her course. They knew she
was not a fishing-craft; her light spars and white sails were sufficient
to refute that opinion. Neither was she one of the revenue-boats. What
could she be, then, since no large ship was in sight to which she could
have belonged? It is only to those who have at some one period or other of
life sojourned in some lone spot of earth, away from human intercourse,
that the anxiety of these poor people could be intelligible. If, good
reader,&mdash;for to you we now appeal,&mdash;it has not been your lot to
have once on a time lived remote from the world and its ways, you cannot
imagine how intensely interesting can become the commonest of those
incidents which mark ordinary existence. They assume, indeed, very
different proportions from the real, and come charged with innumerable
imaginings about that wondrous life, far, far away, where there are
thoughts and passions and deeds and events which never enter into the
dreamland of exile! It was a little after sunset that the boat glided into
the small creek which formed the only harbor of the island; and the moment
after, a young girl sprang on the shore, and hastened towards them.
</p>
<p>

</div>
<p>
Before the Joyces had recovered from their first surprise, they saw Joan
burst from the spot, and, rushing down the slope, throw herself at the
stranger&rsquo;s feet.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And have I found you at last, dear Joan?&rdquo; cried a soft, low voice, while
the speaker raised her tenderly from the ground, and took her hand kindly
within both her own.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Miss Mary, to think you &lsquo;d come after me this far! over the say!&rdquo;
 burst out Joan, sobbing through her joy; for joy it was that now lit up
her features, and made her eyes sparkle even through the fresh tears that
filled them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They told me you had sailed from Galway,&rdquo; resumed Mary, &ldquo;and I wrote to
the ship-agent and found it was correct: your name was in the list of
passengers, and the date of the day you sailed; but, I know not how it
was, Joan, I still clung to the notion that you had contrived this plan to
escape being discovered, and that you were concealed somewhere along the
coast or in the islands. I believe I used to dream of this at first, but
at last I thought of it all day long.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thought of <i>me</i> all day long?&rdquo; broke in Joan, sobbing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And why not, poor child? Was I not the cause of your leaving your home?
Was it not my persuasion that induced you to leave the roof that sheltered
you? I have often wondered whether I had right and reason on my side. I
know at the time I believed I had such. At all events, but for me you had
never quitted that home; but see, Joan, how what we are led to do with an
honest purpose, if it fail to effect what we had in view, often leads to
better and happier ends than we ever dreamed of. I only thought of
conveying to you the last message of your poor grandfather. I little
imagined how so simple an act could influence all your future fortune in
life; and such it has done. Mr. Magennis, suspecting or discovering what
share I had in your flight, has begun a law proceeding against me, and to
give him a rightful claim for redress, has declared you to be&mdash;all
that you wish, dear Joan&mdash;his lawful, wedded wife.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was some time before the poor girl could stifle the sobbing which burst
from her very heart. She kissed Mary&rsquo;s hands over and over with rapture,
and cried out at length, in broken, faltering accents, &ldquo;Did n&rsquo;t they say
well that called you a saint from heaven? Didn&rsquo;t they tell truth that
said, God gave you as a blessing to us?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My poor Joan, you are grateful to me for what I have no share in. I am
nothing but the bearer of good tidings. But tell me, how have you fared
since we parted? Let me hear all that has happened to you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Joan told her simple story in a few words, never deviating from the
narrative, save to speak her heartfelt gratitude to the poor people who
had sheltered and befriended her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There they are!&rdquo; cried she, pointing to the group, who, with a delicacy
of sentiment that might have graced the most refined class, sat apart,
never venturing by a look to obtrude upon the confidence of the others,&mdash;&ldquo;there
they are; and if the world was like them, life would n&rsquo;t have many
crosses!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mary rose, and drew nigh the old man, who stood up respectfully to receive
her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He does n&rsquo;t know much English, Miss Mary,&rdquo; whispered Joan in her ear.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nor am I well skilled in Irish,&rdquo; said Mary, smiling; &ldquo;but I &lsquo;ll do my
best to thank him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
However imperfectly she spoke the native tongue, the words seemed to act
like a charm on those who heard them; and as, young and old, they gathered
around her, their eager looks and delighted faces beamed with a triumphant
joy. They had learned from the boatmen that it was the young princess&mdash;as
in the language of the people she was called&mdash;was before them, and
their pride and happiness knew no bounds.
</p>
<p>
Oh, if courtiers could feel one tithe of the personal devotion to the
sovereign that did these poor peasants to her they regarded as their
chief, what an atmosphere of chivalry would breathe within the palace of
royalty! There was nothing they would not have done or dared at her
bidding; and as she crossed their threshold, and sat down beside their
hearth, the tears of joy that rose to every eye showed that this was an
event to be treasured till memory could retain no more!
</p>
<p>
If Mary did not speak the native dialect fluently, there was a grace and a
charm about the turn of the expressions she used that never failed to
delight those who heard her. That imaginative thread that runs through the
woof of Irish nature in every rank and condition of life&mdash;more
conspicuous, probably, in the very humblest&mdash;imparted an intense
pleasure to hearing and listening to her; and she, on her side, roused and
stimulated by the adventurous character of the incident, the strange wild
spot, the simple people, their isolation and their innocence, spoke with a
warmth and an enthusiasm that were perfectly captivating.
</p>
<p>
She had seen much of the peasantry,&mdash;known them in the most
unfrequented tracts, remote from all their fellow-men,&mdash;in far-away
glens, by dreary mountains, where no footpaths led; but anything so purely
simple and unsophisticated as these poor people she had never met with.
The sons had been&mdash;and that rarely, too&mdash;on the mainland, but
the children and their mothers had never left the Brannocks; they had
never beheld a tree, nor even a flower, save the wild crocus on their
native rock. With what eager delight, then, did they hear Mary describe
the gardens of the castle,&mdash;pictures that glowed with all the
gorgeous colors of a fairy tale. &ldquo;You shall all come and see me, some of
these days. I&rsquo;ll send you a messenger, to say the time,&rdquo; said Mary; &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll promise that what you &lsquo;ll witness will be far above my description of
it!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was a sad moment when Mary arose to say good-bye. Joan, too, was to
accompany her, and the grief at parting with her was extreme. Again and
again the children clung round her, entreating her not to leave them; and
she herself half faltered in her resolution. That lonely rock, that rude
cabin, had been her refuge in the darkest hour of her life, and she felt
the superstitious terror of her class at now deserting them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, come, dear Joan, remember that you have a home now that you can
rightfully return to,&rdquo; whispered Mary. &ldquo;It is not in shame, but in honor,
that you go back to it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was already dark ere they left the Brannocks: a long, heavy swell, too,
the signs of a storm, coming from the westward, made the boatmen eager to
hasten their departure. As yet, however, the air was calm and still, but
it was with that oppressive stillness that forebodes change. They hoisted
their sail, but soon saw that they must, for a while at least, trust to
their oars. The unbroken stillness, save by the measured stroke of the
rowers, the dense dark atmosphere, and the reaction, after a day of toil
and an event of a most moving kind, so overcame Mary that, leaning on
Joan&rsquo;s shoulder, she fell off fast asleep. For a while Joan, proud of the
burden she supported, devoted all her care to watch and protect her from
the night air; but at last weariness stole over herself, and she dropped
off to slumber.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the sea was rising; heavy waves struck the boat, and washed over
her in sheets of spray, although no wind was stirring.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We &lsquo;ll have rain, or a gale of wind before long,&rdquo; said one of the men.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There &lsquo;s some heavy drops falling now,&rdquo; muttered another.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Throw that sail over Miss Mary, for it will soon come down heavily.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A loud clap of thunder burst forth, and as suddenly, like a torrent, the
rain poured down, hissing over the dark sea, and filling the air with a
dull, discordant noise. Still they slept on, nor heard nor felt aught of
that gathering storm.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There now, sure enough, it &lsquo;s coming,&rdquo; cried a boatman, as the sail shook
tremulously; and two great waves, in quick succession, broke over the bow.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to run for Innishmore,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;and lucky if we get
there before it comes on worse.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You ought to wake her up, Loony, and ask her what we are to do.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;ll make straight for the harbor of Kilkieran,&rdquo; replied the helmsman.
&ldquo;The wind is with us, and she&rsquo;s a good sea-boat. Take in the jib, Maurice,
and we&rsquo;ll shorten all sail on her, and&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The rest of his speech was drowned in the uproar of a tremendous sea,
which struck the boat on her quarter and nearly overset her. Not another
word was now uttered, as, with the instinct of their calling, they set
about to prepare for the coming conflict. The mainsail was quickly lowered
and reefed, the oars and loose spars secured, and then, seating themselves
in the bottom of the boat, they waited in silence. By this time the rain
had passed over, and a strong wind swept over the sea.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going fast through the water, anyway!&rdquo; said one of the men. But
though the speech was meant to cheer, none felt or acknowledged the
encouragement.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;d rather than own Cro&rsquo; Martin Castle Miss Mary was safe at home!&rdquo; said
Loony, as he drew the rough sleeve of his coat across his eyes, &ldquo;for it&rsquo;s
thicker it&rsquo;s getting over yonder!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It would be a black day that anything happened her!&rdquo; muttered another.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Musha! we&rsquo;ve wives and childer,&rdquo; said a third, &ldquo;but she&rsquo;s worth a
thousand of us!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And thus, in broken whispers, they spoke; not a thought save of her, not a
care save for her safety. They prayed, too, fervently, and her name was in
all their supplications.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s singing to herself in her sleep,&rdquo; whispered Loony. And the rough
sailors hushed to hear her.
</p>
<p>
Louder and louder, however, grew the storm, sheets of spray and drift
falling over the boat in showers, and all her timbers quivering as she
labored in the stormy sea. A sailor whispered something in Loony&rsquo;s ear,
and he grumbled out in reply,&mdash;&ldquo;Why would I wake her up?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I <i>am</i> awake, Loony,&rdquo; said Mary, in a low, calm voice, &ldquo;and I
see all our danger; but I see, too, that you are meeting it like brave
men, and, better still, like good ones.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The men was thinking we ought to bear up for Innish-more, Miss Mary,&rdquo;
 said Loony, as though ashamed of offering on his own part such counsel.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do what you think best and safest for us all, Loony.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But you were always the captain, miss, when you were aboord!&rdquo; replied he,
with an effort to smile.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And so I should be now, Loony, but that my heart is too full to be as
calm and resolute as I ought to be. This poor thing had not been here now,
but for <i>me</i>.&rdquo; And she wrapped her shawl around Joan as she spoke.
&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s anxiety, perhaps fatigue, but I have not my old courage
to-night!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faix! it will never be fear that will distress you!&rdquo; said he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you mean for myself and my own safety, Loony, you are right. It is not
for me to repine at the hour that calls me away, but I cannot bear to
think how you and others, with so many dear to you, should be perilled
just to serve <i>me!</i> And poor Joan, too, at the moment when life was
about to brighten for her!&rdquo; She held down her head for a minute or two,
and then suddenly, as it were, rallying, she cried out, &ldquo;The boat is
laboring too much for&rsquo;ard, Loony; set the jib on her!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure, if you ordher it, Miss Mary; but she has more sail now than
she can carry.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Set the jib, Loony. I know the craft well; she &lsquo;ll ride the waves all the
lighter for it. If it were but daylight, I almost think I &lsquo;d enjoy this.
We &lsquo;ve been out in as bad before.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Loony shook his head as he went forward to bend the additional sail.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You see she won&rsquo;t bear it, miss,&rdquo; cried he, as the boat plunged fearfully
into the trough of the sea.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let us try,&rdquo; said she, calmly. &ldquo;Stand by, ready to slack off, if I give
the word.&rdquo; And so saying, she took the tiller from the sailor, and seated
herself on the weather-gunwale. &ldquo;There, see how she does it now! Ah,
Loony, confess, I am the true pilot. I knew my nerve would come back when
I took my old post here. I was always a coward in a carriage, if I was n&rsquo;t
on the box and the reins in my hands; and the same at sea. Sit up to
windward, men, and don&rsquo;t move; never mind baling, only keep quiet.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Miss Mary was right,&rdquo; muttered one of the men; &ldquo;the head-sail is drawing
her high out of the water!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is that dark mass before us cloud, or the land?&rdquo; cried she.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the mountains, miss. There to the left, where you see the dip in the
ridge, that&rsquo;s Kilkieran. I think I see the lights on shore now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I see them now myself,&rdquo; cried Mary. &ldquo;Oh, how the sight of land gives love
of life! They called earth truly who named her mother!&rdquo; said she to
herself. &ldquo;What was that which swept past us, Loony?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A boat, miss; and they&rsquo;re hailing us now,&rdquo; cried he, peeping over the
gunwale. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve put her about, and are following our course. They came
out after us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was gallantly done, on such a night as this! I was just thinking to
myself that poor old Mat Landy would have been out, were he living. You
must take the tiller now, Loony, for I don&rsquo;t understand the lights on
shore.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Because they&rsquo;re shifting every minute, miss. It&rsquo;s torches they have, and
they &lsquo;re moving from place to place; but we &lsquo;ll soon be safe now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let us not forget this night, men,&rdquo; said Mary, in a fervent voice. And
then, burying her face within her hands, she spoke no more.
</p>
<p>
It was already daybreak when they gained the little harbor, well-nigh
exhausted, and worn out with fatigue and anxiety. As for Mary, wet through
and cold, she could not rise from her seat without assistance, and almost
fainted as she put her foot on shore. She turned one glance seaward to
where the other boat was seen following them, and then, holding Joan&rsquo;s
hand, she slowly toiled up the rocky ascent to the village. To the crowd
of every age that surrounded her she could only give a faint, sickly smile
of recognition, and they, in deep reverence, stood without speaking,
gazing on her wan features and the dripping garments which clung to her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, not to the inn, Loony,&rdquo; said she, to a question from him. &ldquo;The first
cabin we meet will shelter us, and then&mdash;home!&rdquo; There was something
of intense sorrow in the thought that passed then through her mind, for
her eyes suddenly filled up, and heavy tears rolled along her cheeks.
&ldquo;Have they got in yet?&rdquo; said she, looking towards the sea.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, miss; they&rsquo;re close alongside now. It&rsquo;s the revenue boat that went
after us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wirra, wirra! but that&rsquo;s bad news for her now,&rdquo; muttered a boatman, in
conversation with an old woman at his side.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the bad news, Patsey?&rdquo; said Mary, overhearing him.
</p>
<p>
But the man did not dare to answer; and though he looked around on every
side, none would speak for him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You used to be more frank with me,&rdquo; said Mary, calmly. &ldquo;Tell me what has
happened.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Still not a word was uttered, a mournful silence brooded over the crowd,
and each seemed to shun the task of breaking it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You will make me fear worse than the reality, perhaps,&rdquo; said she,
tremulously. &ldquo;Is the calamity near home? No. Is it then my uncle?&rdquo; A low
faint cry burst from her, and she dropped down on her knees; but scarcely
had she joined her hands to pray, than she fell back, fainting, to the
ground.
</p>
<p>
They carried her, still insensible as she was, into a fisherman&rsquo;s cabin,
till they went in search of a conveyance to take her to the cottage.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXXII. LETTER FROM MASSINGBRED.
</h2>
<h3>
&ldquo;Martin Arms, Oughterard.
</h3>
<p>
&ldquo;In spite of all your reasonings, all your cautions, and all your
warnings, here I am once more, Harry, denizen of the little dreary parlor
whence I first looked out at Dan Nelligan&rsquo;s shop something more than a
year since. What changes of fortune has that brief space accomplished I
what changes has it effected even in my own nature! I feel this in nothing
more than in my altered relations with others. If the first evidence of
amendment in a man be shame and sorrow for the past, I may probably be on
the right road now, since I heartily grieve over the worthless,
purposeless life I have led hitherto.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am well aware that you would not accept the reason I gave you for
coming here. You said that, as to taking leave of my constituents, a
letter was the ordinary and the sufficient course. You also hinted that
our intercourse had not been of that close and friendly nature which
requires a personal farewell, and then you suggested that other and less
defensible motives had probably their share in this step. Well, you are
right, perfectly right; I wanted to see the spot which has so far exerted
an immense influence over me; I wanted&mdash;if you will have the
confession&mdash;to see <i>her</i> too,&mdash;to see her in the humble
station she belongs to, in the lowly garb of the steward&rsquo;s daughter. I was
curious to ascertain what change her bearing would undergo in the change
of position; would she conform to the lowlier condition at once and
without struggle, or would her haughty nature chafe and fret against the
obstacles of a small and mean existence? If you were right in guessing
this, you are equally wrong in the motive you ascribe to me. Not, indeed,
that you palpably express, but only hint at it; still I cannot endure even
the shadow of such a surmise without a flat and full denial. Perhaps,
after all, I have mistaken your meaning,&mdash;would it were so! I do
indeed wish that you should not ascribe to me motives so unworthy and so
mean. A revenge for her refusal of me! a reprisal for the proud rejection
of my hand and fortune! No, my dear Harry, I feel, as I write the words,
that they never were yours. You say, however, that I am curious to know if
I should think her as lovable and attractive in the humble dress and
humble station that pertain to her, as when I saw her moving more than
equal amongst the proudest and haughtiest of Europe. To have any doubt on
this score would be to distrust her sincerity of character. She must be
what I have ever seen her, or she is an actress. Difference of condition,
different associates, different duties will exact different discipline,
but she herself must be the same, or she is a falsehood,&mdash;a
deception.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And then you add, it is perhaps as well that I should &lsquo;submit to the rude
test of a disenchantment.&rsquo; Well, I accept the challenge, and I am here.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;These thoughts of self would obtrude in the very beginning of a letter I
had destined for other objects. You ask me for a narrative of my journey
and its accidents, and you shall have it. On my way over here in the
packet, I made acquaintance with an elderly man, who seemed thoroughly
acquainted with all the circumstances of the Martins and their
misfortunes. From him I ascertained that all Scanlan had told me was
perfectly correct. The reversion of the estate has been sold for a sum
incredibly small in proportion to its value, and in great part the
proceeds of gambling transactions. Martin is, therefore, utterly,
irretrievably ruined. Merl has taken every step with all the security of
the best advice, and in a few months, weeks perhaps, will be declared
owner of Cro&rsquo; Martin. Even in the &lsquo;fast times&rsquo; we live in, such rapid ruin
as this stands alone! You tell me that of your own college and mess
associates not more than one in five or six have survived the wreck of
fortune the first few years of extravagance accomplish, and that Manheim,
Brussels, and Munich can show the white-seamed, mock-smartened-up
gentilities which once were the glories of Bond Street and the Park; but
for poor Martin, I suspect, even these last sanctuaries do not remain,&mdash;as
I hear it, he is totally gone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;From the very inn where I am staying Merls agents are issuing notices of
all kinds to the tenants and &lsquo;others&rsquo; to desist and refrain from cutting
timber, quarrying marbles, and what not, on certain unspeakable
localities, with threats in case of non-compliance. Great placards cover
the walls of the town, headed &lsquo;Caution to all Tenants on the Estate of
Cro&rsquo; Martin.&rsquo; The excitement in the neighborhood is intense, overwhelming.
Whatever differences of political opinion existed between the Martins and
the people of the borough, whatever jealousies grew out of disparity of
station, seemed suddenly merged in sympathy for this great misfortune.
They are, of course, ignorant of the cause of this sudden calamity, and
ask each other how, when, and where such a fortune because engulfed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But to proceed regularly. On my reaching Dublin, after a hurried visit to
my father, I drove off to Mr. Repton&rsquo;s house. You may remember his name as
that of the old lawyer, some of whose bar stories amused you so highly. I
found him in a spacious mansion of an old neglected street,&mdash;Henrietta
Street,&mdash;once the great aristocratic quarter of Ancient Dublin, and
even to this day showing traces of real splendor. The old man received me
in a room of immense proportions, furnished as it was when Flood was the
proprietor. He was at luncheon when I entered; and for company had the
very same stranger with whom I made acquaintance in the packet.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Repton started as we recognized each other, but at a sign or a word, I&rsquo;m
not certain which, from the other, merely said, &lsquo;My friend was just
speaking of his having met you, Mr. Massingbred.&rsquo; This somewhat informal
presentation over, I joined them, and we fell a chatting over the story of
Cro&rsquo; Martin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They were both eager to hear something about Merl, his character,
pursuits, and position; and you would have been amazed to see how
surprised they were at my account of a man whose type we are all so
familiar with.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You would scarcely credit the unfeigned astonishment manifested by these
two shrewd and crafty men at the sketch I gave them of our Hebrew friend.
One thing is quite clear,&mdash;it was not the habit, some forty or fifty
years ago, to admit the Merls of the world to terms of intimacy, far less
of friendship.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;As I said, Repton,&rsquo; broke in the stranger, sternly, &lsquo;it all comes of
that degenerate tone which has crept in of late, making society like a
tavern, where he who can pay his bill cannot be denied entrance. Such
fellows as this Merl had no footing in our day. The man who associated
with such would have forfeited his own place in the world.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Very true,&rsquo; said Repton, &lsquo;though we borrowed their money we never bowed
to them.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;And we did wisely, sir,&rsquo; retorted the other. &lsquo;The corruption of their
manners was fifty times worse than all their usury! The gallant Hussar
Captain, as we see here, never scrupled about admitting to his closest
intimacy a fellow not fit company for his valet. Can&rsquo;t you perceive that
when a man will descend to such baseness to obtain money, there is no
measuring the depth he will go to when pressed to pay it?&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I am intimate with Martin,&rsquo; said I, interrupting, &lsquo;and I can honestly
assure you that it was rather to an easy, careless, uncalculating
disposition he owes his misfortunes, than to anything like a spendthrift
habit.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Mere hair-splitting this, sir,&rsquo; replied he, almost rudely. &lsquo;He who
spends what is not his own, I have but one name for. It matters little in
my estimation whether he extorts the supply by a bill or a bullet.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I own to you, Harry, I burned to retort to a speech the tone and manner
of which were both more offensive than the words; but the stranger&rsquo;s age,
his venerable appearance, and something like deep and recent sorrow about
him, restrained me, and I caught, by a look from Repton, that he was
grateful for my forbearance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Come, sir,&rsquo; said he, addressing me, &lsquo;you say you know Captain Martin;
now let me ask you one question: Is there any one trait or feature of his
character to which, if his present misfortunes were to pass away, you
could attach a hope of amendment? Has not this life of bill-renewing,
these eternal straits for cash&mdash;with all the humiliations that
accompany them,&mdash;made him a mere creature of schemes and plots,&mdash;a
usurer in spirit, though a pauper in fact?&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;When I say, sir, that you are addressing this demand to one whom Captain
Martin deems his friend, you will see the impropriety you have fallen
into.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;My young friend is right,&rsquo; broke in Repton. &lsquo;The Court rules against the
question; nor would it be evidence even if answered.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was angry at this interference of Repton&rsquo;s. I wanted to reply to this
man myself; but still, as I looked at his sorrow-struck features, and saw
what I fancied the marks of a proud suffering spirit, I was well satisfied
at not having given way to temper; still more so did I feel as he turned
towards me, and, with a manner of ineffable gentleness, said, &lsquo;I entreat
you to pardon me, sir, for an outburst of which I am already ashamed. A
rude life and some bitter experiences have made me hard of heart and
coarse in speech; still, it is only in moments of forgetfulness that I
cease to remember what indulgence he owes to others who has such need of
forgiveness himself.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I grasped his hand at once, and felt that his pressed mine like a
friend&rsquo;s.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;You spoke of going down to the West,&rsquo; said he, after a brief pause. &lsquo;I
start for that country to-night; you would do me a great favor should you
accompany me.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I acceded at once, and he went on. &lsquo;Repton was to have been of the party,
but business delays him a few days in town.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I &lsquo;ll join you before the end of the week,&rsquo; said Repton; &lsquo;by that time
Mr. Massingbred will have expended all his borough blandishments and be
free to give us his society.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Though the old lawyer now tried, and tried cleverly, to lead us away to
lighter, pleasanter themes, the attempt was a failure; each felt, I
suspect, some oppressive weight on his spirits that indisposed him to less
serious talk; and again we came back to the Martins, the stranger
evidently seeking to learn all he could of the disposition and temper of
the young man.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;It is as I thought,&rsquo; said he, at last. &lsquo;It is the weak, sickly tone of
the day has brought all this corruption upon us! Once upon a time the
vices and follies of young men took their rise in their several natures,&mdash;this
one gambled, the other drank, and so on,&mdash;the mass, however, was
wonderfully sound and healthy; the present school, however, is to ape a
uniformity, so that each may show himself in the livery of his fellows,
thus imbibing wickedness he has no taste for, and none be less depraved
and heartless than those around him. Let the women but follow the fashion,
and there &lsquo;s an end of us, as the great people we boasted to be!&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I give you, so well as I can trust my memory, his words, Harry, but I
cannot give you a certain sardonic bitterness,&mdash;a tone of mingled
scorn and sorrow, such as I never before witnessed. He gave me the
impression of being one who, originally frank, generous, and trustful,
had, by intercourse with the world and commerce with mankind, grown to
suspect every one and disbelieve in honesty, and yet could not bring his
heart to acknowledge what his head had determined. In this wise, at least,
I read his character from the opportunities I had of conversing with him
on our journey. It was easy to see that he was a gentleman,&mdash;taking
the word in the widest of its acceptations,&mdash;but from things that
dropped from him, I could gather that his life had been that of an
adventurer. He had been in the sea and land services of many of those new
states of Southern America, had even risen to political importance in some
of them; had possessed mines and vast tracts of territory one day, and the
next saw himself &lsquo;without a piastre.&rsquo; He had conducted operations against
the Indians, and made treaties with them, and latterly had lived as the
elected chief of a tribe in the west of the Rocky Mountains. But he knew
civilized as well as savage life, had visited Spain in the rank of an
envoy, and was familiar with all the great society of Rome, and the
intrigues of its prince-bishops. The only theme, however, on which he
really warmed was sport. The prairies brought out all his enthusiasm, and
then he spoke like one carried away by glorious recollections of a time
when, as he said himself, &lsquo;heart and hand and eye never failed him.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;When he spoke of family ties or home affections, it was in a spirit of
almost mockery, which puzzled me. His reasoning was that the attachments
we form are only emanations of our own selfishness. We love, simply to be
loved again. Whereas, were we single-hearted, we should be satisfied to
know that those dear to us were well and happy, and only seek to serve
them without demonstration or display.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Am I wearying you, Harry, by dwelling on the traits of a man who, for the
brief space I have known him, has made the most profound impression upon
me? Even where I dissent&mdash;as is often the case&mdash;from his views,
I have to own to myself that were I <i>he</i>, I should think and reason
precisely as he does. I fancied at first that, like many men who had
quitted civilized life for the rude ways of the &lsquo;bush,&rsquo; he would have
contrasted the man of refinement unfavorably with the savage, but he was
too keen and acute for such a sweeping fallacy; he saw the good and evil
in both, and sensibly remarked how independent of all education were the
really strong characteristics of human nature. &lsquo;There is not a great
quality of our first men,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that I have not found to exist among
the wild tribes of the Far West, nor is there an excellence of savage
nature I have not witnessed amidst the polished and the pampered.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;From what I can collect, he is only here passingly; some family matter
has brought him over to this country; but he is already impatient to be
back to his old haunts and associates, and his home beside the Orinoco. He
has even asked me to come and visit him there; and from all I can see I
should be as likely to attain distinction among the Chaymas as in the
House of Commons, and should find the soft turf of the Savannahs as
pleasant as the Opposition benches. In fact, Harry, I have half promised
to accept his invitation; and if he renew it with anything like
earnestness, I am resolved to go.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am just setting out for the Hendersons&rsquo;, and while the horses are being
harnessed I have re-read your letter. Of course I have &lsquo;counted the cost,&rsquo;&mdash;I
have weighed the question to a pennyweight! I could already write down the
list of those who will not know me at all, those who will know me a
little, and the still fewer who will know my wife! Can you not see, my
dear friend, that where one drags the anchor so easily, the mooring-ground
was never good? The society to which you belong by such slender
attachments gives no wound by separation from it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My anxiety now is on a very different score: it is that she will still
refuse me. The hope I cling to is that she will see in my persistence a
proof of sincerity. I would not, if I could, bring any family influence to
my aid, and yet, short of this, there is nothing I would not do to insure
success.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish I had never re-opened your letter; that vein of sarcastic coolness
which runs through it will never turn me from my purpose. You seem to
forget, besides, that you are talking to a man of the world, just as
hackneyed, just as &lsquo;used up&rsquo; as yourself. I should like to see you assume
this indolent dalliance before La Henderson! Take my word for it, Harry,
you &lsquo;d be safer with the impertinence amongst some of your duchesses in
Pall Mall. You say that great beauty in a woman, like genius in a man, is
a kind of brevet nobility, and yet you add that the envy of the world will
never weary of putting the possessor &lsquo;on his title.&rsquo; How gladly would I
accept this challenge! Ay, Harry, I tell you, in all defiance, that your
proudest could not vie with her!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I wanted a proof of the vassalage of the social state we live in, I
have it before me in the fact that a man like yourself, wellborn, young,
rich, and high-hearted, should place the judgments and prejudices of half
a dozen old tabbies of either sex above all the promptings of a noble
ambition&mdash;all the sentiments of a generous devotion. Your starling
cry of &lsquo;the Steward&rsquo;s daughter,&rsquo; then, does not deter, it only determines
the purpose
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of yours faithfully,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Jack Massingbred.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You &lsquo;ll see by the papers that I have accepted the Chiltern Hundreds.
This is the first step.&mdash;now for the second!&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER XXXIII. A DINNER AT &ldquo;THE LODGE&rdquo;
 </h2>
<p>
While the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; of a certain day, some twenty years ago, was
chronicling the illustrious guests who partook of his Majesty&rsquo;s
hospitalities at Windsor, the &ldquo;Dublin Evening Mail,&rdquo; under the less
pretentious heading of &ldquo;Viceregal Court,&rdquo; gave a list of those who had
dined with his Excellency at the Lodge.
</p>
<p>
There was not anything very striking or very new in the announcement. Our
<i>dramatis personæ,</i> in this wise, are limited; and after the
accustomed names of the Lord Chancellor and Mrs. Dobbs, the Master of the
Rolls and Mrs. Wiggins, Colonel Somebody of the 105th, Sir Felix and Miss
Slasher, you invariably find the catalogue close with an un-der-secretary,
a king-at-arms, and the inevitable Captain Lawrence Belcour, the
aide-de-camp in waiting!&mdash;these latter recorded somewhat in the same
spirit that the manager of a provincial theatre swells the roll of his
company, by the names of the machinist, the scene-painter, and the leader
of the band! We have no peculiar concern, however, with this fact, save
that on the day in question our old friend Joseph Nelligan figured as a
vice-regal guest. It was the first time he had been so honored, and,
although not of a stamp to attach any great prize to the distinction, he
was well aware that the recognition was intended as an honor; the more,
when an aide-de-camp signified to him that his place at table was on one
side of his Excellency.
</p>
<p>
When this veracious history first displayed young Nelligan at a
dinner-party, his manner was shy and constrained; his secluded,
student-like habits had given him none of that hardihood so essential in
society. If he knew little of passing topics, he knew less of the tone men
used in discussing them; and now, although more conversant with the world
and its ways, daily brought into contact with the business of life, his
social manner remained pretty nearly the same cold, awkward, and diffident
thing it had been at first. Enlist him in a great subject, or call upon
him on a great occasion, and he could rise above it; place him in a
position to escape notice, and you never heard more of him.
</p>
<p>
The dinner company on this day contained nothing very formidable, either
on the score of station or ability,&mdash;a few bar celebrities with their
wives, an eccentric dean with a daughter, a garrison colonel or two, three
country squires, and a doctor from Merrion Square. It was that interregnal
period between the time when the castle parties included the first gentry
of the land, and that later era when the priest and the agitator became
the favored guests of vice-royalty. It is scarce necessary to say it was,
as regards agreeability, inferior to either. There was not the courtly
urbanity and polished pleasantry of a very accomplished class; nor was
there the shrewd and coarse but racy intelligence of Mr. O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s
followers.
</p>
<p>
The Marquis of Reckington had come over to Ireland to &ldquo;inaugurate,&rdquo; as the
newspapers called it, a new policy; that is, he was to give to the working
of the relief bill an extension and a significance which few either of its
supporters or opposers in Parliament ever contemplated. The inequality of
the Romanist before the law he might have borne; social depreciation was a
heavier evil, and one quite intolerable. Now, as the change to the new
system required considerable tact and address, they intrusted the task to
a most accomplished and well-bred gentleman; and were Ireland only to be
won by dinner-parties, Lord Reckington must have been its victor.
</p>
<p>
To very high rank and great personal advantages he united a manner of the
most perfect kind. Dignified enough always to mark his station and his own
consciousness of it, it was cordial without effort, frank and easy without
display. If he could speak with all the weight of authority, he knew how
to listen with actual deference; and there was that amount of change and
&ldquo;play&rdquo; in his demeanor that made his companion, whoever for the moment he
might be, believe that his views and arguments had made a deep impression
on the Viceroy. To those unacquainted with such men, and the school to
which they belong, there might have appeared something unreal, almost
dramatic, in the elegant gracefulness of his bow, the gentle affability of
his smile, the undeviating courtesy which he bestowed on all around him;
but they were all of the man himself,&mdash;his very instincts,&mdash;his
nature.
</p>
<p>
It had apparently been amongst his Excellency&rsquo;s instructions from his
government to seek out such rising men of the Roman Catholic party as
might be elevated and promoted on the just claims of their individual
merits,&mdash;men, in fact, whose conduct and bearing would be certain to
justify their selection for high office. It could not be supposed that a
party long proscribed, long estranged from all participation in power,
could be rich in such qualifications. At the bar, the ablest men usually
threw themselves into the career of politics, and of course by strong
partisanship more or less prejudiced their claims to office. It was rare
indeed to find one who, with the highest order of abilities, was satisfied
to follow a profession whose best rewards were denied him. Such was Joseph
Nelligan when he was first &ldquo;called,&rdquo; and such he continued to the very
hour we now see him. Great as had been his college successes, his triumphs
at the bar overtopped them all. They who remembered his shy and reserved
manner wondered whence he came by his dignity; they who knew his youth
could not imagine how he came by his &ldquo;law.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mr. M&rsquo;Casky, the castle law-adviser, an old recruiting-serjeant of
capacities, who had &ldquo;tipped the shilling&rdquo; to men of every party, had
whispered his name to the Under-Secretary, who had again repeated it to
the Viceroy. He was, as M&rsquo;Casky said, &ldquo;the man they wanted, with talent
enough to confront the best of the opposite party, and wealthy enough to
want nothing that can figure in a budget.&rdquo; Hence was he, then, there a
favored guest, and seated on his Excellency&rsquo;s left hand.
</p>
<p>
For the magic influence of that manner which we have mentioned as
pertaining to the Viceroy, we ask for no better evidence than the sense of
perfect ease which Joe Nelligan now enjoyed. The <i>suave</i> dignity of
the Marquis was blended with a something like personal regard, a
mysterious intimation that seemed to say, &ldquo;This is the sort of man I have
long been looking for; how gratifying that I should have found him at
last!&rdquo; They concurred in so many points, too, not merely in opinions, but
actually in the very expressions by which they characterized them; and
when at last his Excellency, having occasion to quote something he had
said, called him &ldquo;Nelligan,&rdquo; the spell was complete.
</p>
<p>
Oh dear! when we torture our brains to legislate for apothecaries,
endeavoring in some way or other to restrict the sale of those subtle
ingredients on every grain or drop of which a human life may hang, why do
we never think of those far more subtle elements of which great people are
the dispensers,&mdash;flatteries more soothing than chloroform, smiles
more lulling than poppy-juice! Imagine poor Nelligan under a course of
this treatment, dear reader; fancy the delicious poison as it insinuates
itself through his veins, and if you have ever been so drugged yourself,
picture to your mind all the enjoyment he experienced.
</p>
<p>
By one of those adroit turns your social magician is master of, the
Viceroy had drawn the conversation towards Nelligan&rsquo;s county and his
native town.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was to have paid a visit to poor Martin there,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I
certainly should have looked in upon <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Nelligan&rsquo;s cheek was in a flame; pride and shame were both there, warring
for the mastery.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; said his Excellency, who saw the necessity of a diversion,
&ldquo;I fear that he has left that immense estate greatly embarrassed. Some one
mentioned to me, the other day, that the heir will not succeed to even a
fourth of the old property.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have heard even worse, my Lord,&rdquo; said Nelligan. &ldquo;There is a rumor that
he is left without a shilling.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How very shocking! They are connections of my own!&rdquo; said the Viceroy; as
though what he said made the misery attain its climax.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am aware, my Lord, that Lady Dorothea is related to your Excellency,
and I am surprised you have not heard the stories I allude to.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But perhaps I am incorrect,&rdquo; said the Marquis. &ldquo;It may be that I <i>have</i>
heard them; so many things pass through one&rsquo;s ears every day. But here is
Colonel Mas-singbred; he &lsquo;s sure to know it. Massingbred, we want some
news of the Martins&mdash;the Martins of&mdash;what is it called?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Cro&rsquo; Martin, my Lord,&rdquo; said Nelligan, reddening.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hold the very latest news of that county in my hand, my Lord,&rdquo; replied
the Secretary. &ldquo;It is an express from my son, who writes from Oughterard.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Nelligan stood, scarcely breathing, with impatience to hear the tidings.
</p>
<p>
Colonel Massingbred ran his eyes over the first page of the letter,
murmuring to himself the words; then turning over, he said: &ldquo;Yes, here it
is,&mdash;&lsquo;While I write this, the whole town is in a state of intense
excitement; the magistrates have sent in for an increased force of police,
and even soldiery, to repress some very serious disturbances on the Martin
property. It would appear that Merl&mdash;the man who assumes to claim the
property, as having purchased the reversion from young Martin&mdash;was
set upon by a large mob, and pursued, himself and his friends, for several
miles across the country. They escaped with their lives, but have arrived
here in a lamentable plight. There is really no understanding these
people. It was but the other day, and there was no surer road to their
favor than to abuse and vilify these same Martins, and now they are quite
ready to murder any one who aspires to take their place. If one was to
credit the stories afloat, they have already wreaked a fatal vengeance on
some fellows employed by Merl to serve notices on the tenantry; but I
believe that the outrages have really gone no further than such
maltreatment as Irishmen like to give, and are accustomed to take.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Here his Excellency laughed heartily, and Joe Nelligan looked grave.
</p>
<p>
Massingbred read on: &ldquo;&lsquo;Without being myself a witness to it, I never could
have credited the almost feudal attachment of these people to an &ldquo;Old
House.&rdquo; The Radical party in the borough are, for the moment, proscribed,
and dare not show themselves in the streets; and even Magennis, who so
lately figured as an enemy to the Martins, passed through the town this
morning with his wife, with a great banner flying over his jaunting-car,
inscribed &ldquo;The Martins for Ever!&rdquo; This burst of sentiment on his part, I
ought to mention, was owing to a most devoted piece of heroism performed
by Miss Martin, who sought out the lost one and brought her safely back,
through a night of such storm and hurricane as few ever remember. Such an
act, amidst such a people, is sure of its reward. The peasantry would, to
a man, lay down their lives for her; and coming critically, as the
incident did, just when a new proprietor was about to enforce his claim,
you can fancy the added bitterness it imparted to their spirit of
resistance. I sincerely trust that the magistrates will not accede to the
demand for an increased force. A terrible collision is sure to be the
result, and I know enough of these people to be aware of what can be done
by a little diplomacy, particularly when the right negotiator is employed.
I mean, therefore, to go over and speak to Mr. Nelligan, who is the only
man of brains amongst the magistrates here.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A relative, I presume,&rdquo; said his Excellency.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My father, my Lord,&rdquo; replied Joe, blushing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! here is the result of his interview,&rdquo; said Massing-bred, turning to
the foot of the page. &ldquo;&lsquo;Nelligan quite agreed in the view I had taken, and
said the people would assuredly disarm and perhaps destroy any force we
could send against them. He is greatly puzzled what course to adopt; and
when I suggested the propriety of invoking Miss Martin&rsquo;s aid, told me that
this is out of the question, since she is on a sick-bed. While we were
speaking, a Dublin physician passed through on his way to visit her. This
really does add to the complication, for she is, perhaps, the only one who
could exert a great influence over the excited populace. In any other
country it might read strangely, that it was to a young lady men should
have recourse in a moment of such peril; but this is like no other
country, the people like no other people, the young lady herself, perhaps,
like no other young lady!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
By a scarcely perceptible movement of his head, and a very slight change
of voice, Colonel Massingbred intimated to the Viceroy that there was
something for his private ear, and Lord Reckington stepped back to hear
it. Nelligan, too deeply occupied in his own thoughts to remark the
circumstance, stood in the same place, silent and motionless.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is to this passage,&rdquo; whispered the Secretary, &ldquo;I want to direct your
Excellency&rsquo;s attention: &lsquo;All that I see here,&rsquo; my son writes,&mdash;&lsquo;all
that I see here is a type of what is going on, at large, over the island.
Old families uprooted, old ties severed; the people, with no other
instinct than lawlessness, hesitating which side to take. Their old
leaders, only bent upon the political, have forgotten the social struggle,
and thus the masses are left without guidance or direction. It is my firm
conviction that the Church of Rome will seize the happy moment to usurp an
authority thus unclaimed, and the priest step in between the landlord and
the demagogue; and it is equally my belief that you can only retard, not
prevent, this consummation. If you should be of <i>my</i> opinion, and be
able to induce his Excellency to think with us, act promptly and
decisively. Enlist the Roman Catholic laity in your cause before you be
driven to the harder compact of having to deal with the clergy. And first
of all, make&mdash;for fortunately you have the vacancy,&mdash;make young
Nelligan your solicitor-general.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The Viceroy gave a slight start, and smiled. He had not, as yet,
accustomed his mind to such bold exercise of his patronage. He lived,
however, to get over this sensation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; resumed Massingbred, &ldquo;argues this at some length. If you permit,
I &lsquo;ll leave the letter in your Excellency&rsquo;s hands. In fact, I read it very
hurriedly, and came over here the moment I glanced my eyes over this
passage.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
His Excellency took the letter, and turned to address a word to Joe
Nelligan, but he had left the spot.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Belcour,&rdquo; said the Viceroy, &ldquo;tell Mr. Nelligan I wish to speak to him. I
shall be in the small drawing-room. I &lsquo;ll talk with him alone.
Massingbred, be ready to come when I shall send for you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The Viceroy sat alone by the fire, pondering over all he had heard. There
was, indeed, that to ponder over, even in the brief, vague description of
the writer. &ldquo;The difficulties of Ireland,&rdquo; as it was the fashion of the
day to call them, were not such as government commissions discover, or
blue books describe; they lay deeper than the legislative lead-line ever
reaches,&mdash;many a fathom down below statutes and Acts of Parliament.
They were in the instincts, the natures, the blood of a people who had
never acknowledged themselves a conquered nation. Perhaps his Excellency
lost himself in speculations, mazy and confused enough to addle deeper
heads. Perhaps he was puzzled to think how he could bring the Cabinet to
see these things, or the importance that pertained to them; who knows? At
all events, time glided on, and still he was alone. At length the
aide-de-camp appeared, and with an air of some confusion, said,&mdash;&ldquo;It
would appear, my Lord, that Mr. Nelligan has gone away.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, he never said good-night; he did n&rsquo;t take leave of me!&rdquo; said the
Viceroy, smiling.
</p>
<p>
The aide-de-camp slightly elevated his brows, as though to imply his sense
of what it might not have become him to characterize in words.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very strange, indeed!&rdquo; repeated his Excellency; &ldquo;is n&rsquo;t it, Belcour?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very strange, indeed, your Excellency,&rdquo; said the other, bowing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There could have been no disrespect in it,&rdquo; said his Lordship,
good-humoredly; &ldquo;of <i>that</i> I&rsquo;m quite certain. Send Colonel
Massingbred here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone off, Massingbred,&rdquo; said the Viceroy, as the other appeared.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So I have just learned, my Lord. I conclude he was not aware&mdash;that
he was unacquainted with&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, of course, Massingbred,&rdquo; broke in the Viceroy, laughing, &ldquo;the fault
is all with my predecessors in office; they never invited these men as
they ought to have done. Have you sounded M&rsquo;Casky as to the appointment?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lord; he thinks &lsquo;we might do worse.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A qualified approval, certainly. Perhaps he meant we might select
himself!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I rather opine, my Lord, that he regards Nelligan&rsquo;s promotion as likely
to give offence to Mr. O&rsquo;Connell, unless that he be himself consulted upon
it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then comes the question, Who is it governs this country, Colonel
Massingbred?&rdquo; said the Marquis; and for the first time a flash of angry
meaning darkened his cheeks. &ldquo;If I be here,&rdquo;&mdash;he stopped and
hesitated,&mdash;&ldquo;if you and I be here only to ratify appointments made by
irresponsible individuals,&mdash;if we hold the reins of power only to be
told where we &lsquo;re to drive to,&mdash;I must own the office is not very
dignified, nor am I patient enough to think it endurable.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;M&rsquo;Casky only suggested that it might be advisable to see O&rsquo;Connell on the
subject, not, as it were, to pass him over in conferring the appointment.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I cannot at all concur in this view, Massingbred,&rdquo; said the Marquis,
proudly; &ldquo;there could be no such humiliation in the world as a patronage
administered in this wise. Write to Nelligan; write to him to-night. Say
that his abrupt departure alone prevented my making to him personally the
offer of the solicitorship; add that you have my directions to place the
office in his hands, and express a strong wish, on your own part, that he
may not decline it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Massingbred bowed in acquiescence, and after a pause his Excellency went
on:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There would be no objection to your adding something to the effect that
my selection of him was prompted by motives in which party has no share;
that his acknowledged eminence at the bar,&mdash;a character to which even
political opponents bear honorable testimony,&mdash;in fact, Massingbred,&rdquo;
 added he, impatiently, &ldquo;if the appointment should come to be questioned in
the House, let us have it on record that we made it solely on motives
directed to the public service. You understand me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I think so, my Lord,&rdquo; said Massingbred, and withdrew.
</p>
<p>
If it were not that other cares and other interests call us away, we would
gladly linger a little longer to speculate on the Viceroy&rsquo;s thoughts as he
reseated himself by the fire. His brow was overcast and his features
clouded. Was it that he felt he had entered the lists, and thrown down the
glove to a strong and resolute opponent? Had he before him a vista of the
terrible conflict between expediency and honor that was soon to be his
fate? Had he his doubts as to the support his own Cabinet would afford
him? Was his pride the ruling sentiment of the moment, or did there enter
into his calculations the subtle hope of all the eager expectancy this
appointment would create, all the disposable venality it would lay at his
discretion? Who can answer these questions? who solve these doubts? Is it
not very possible that his mind wandered amidst them all? Is it not more
than likely that they passed in review before him? for when he rejoined
his company his manner was more absent, his courtesy less easy than usual.
</p>
<p>
At length Mr. M&rsquo;Casky came forward to say goodnight.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Colonel Massingbred has told you of those disturbances in the West, has
he not?&rdquo; asked the Viceroy.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lord,&rdquo; replied the other.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what opinion&mdash;what advice did you give?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To let matters alone, my Lord; to be always a little behind time,
particularly in sending a force. &lsquo;Never despatch the police to quell a
riot,&rsquo; said John Toler, &lsquo;unless one of the factions be completely beaten,
otherwise you &lsquo;ll have them both on your back;&rsquo; and I assure your
Excellency, Ireland has been very successfully governed under that maxim
for years past.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, M&rsquo;Casky; thank you for the advice,&rdquo; said his Excellency,
laughing, and wished him good-night.

CHAPTER XXXIV. AN HONORED GUEST
</h2>
<p>
It was a time of unusual stir and bustle at the Martin Arms; the house was
crammed with company. Messengers&mdash;some mounted, others on foot&mdash;came
and went at every moment; horses stood ready saddled and harnessed in the
stables, in waiting for any emergency; in fact, there was a degree of
movement and animation only second to that of a contested election. In the
midst of this confusion a chaise with four smoking posters drew up at the
door, and a sharp, clear voice called out,&mdash;&ldquo;Morrissy, are my rooms
ready?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, indeed, Mr. Repton,&rdquo; stammered out the abashed landlord; &ldquo;the house
is full; there&rsquo;s not a spot in it to put a child in.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You got my letter, I suppose?&rdquo; said Repton, angrily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I did, sir, but it was too late; the whole house was engaged by Mr.
Scanlan, and the same evening the company arrived in two
coaches-and-four.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And who is the precious company you speak of?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Merl, sir,&rdquo; said the other, dropping his voice to a whisper, &ldquo;the new
owner of Cro&rsquo; Martin; he&rsquo;s here, with two or three great lawyers and one
or two of his friends. They came down to serve the notices and give
warning&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, what is to be done? where can I be accommodated?&rdquo; broke in Repton,
hastily. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Mr. Massing-bred in the house?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, sir, he had to move out, too; but, sure enough, he left a bit of a
note for you in the bar.&rdquo; And he hastened off at once to fetch it.
</p>
<p>
Repton broke open the seal impatiently, and read:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear Mr. Repton,&mdash;I regret that you &lsquo;ll find the inn full on your
arrival; they turned me out yesterday to make room for Mr. Merl and his
followers. Happily, Mr. Nelligan heard of my destitution, and offered me a
quarter at his house. He also desires me to say that he will deem it a
very great favor if you will accept the shelter of his roof, and in
hopeful anticipation of your consenting, he will wait dinner for your
arrival. From my own knowledge, I can safely assure you that the offer is
made in a spirit of true hospitality, and I sincerely wish that you may
accept it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yours very faithfully,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;J. Massingbred.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where does Mr. Nelligan live?&rdquo; asked Repton, as he refolded the letter.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just across the street, sir. There it is.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Set me down there, then,&rdquo; said Repton. And the next moment he was at
Nelligan&rsquo;s door.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;This is a very great honor, sir,&rdquo; said old Dan, as he appeared in a suit
of decorous black. &ldquo;It is, indeed, a proud day that gives me the pleasure
of seeing you here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear sir, if you had no other distinction than being the father of
Joseph Nelligan, the honor and the pride lie all in the opposite scale. I
am sincerely glad to be your guest, and to know you where every true
Irishman is seen to the greatest advantage,&mdash;at the head of his own
board.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
While Nelligan conducted his guest to his room, he mentioned that
Massingbred had ridden over to Cro&rsquo; Martin early in the morning, but would
be certainly back for dinner.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what &lsquo;s the news of Miss Martin? Is she better?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They say not, sir. The last accounts are far from favorable.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sir Henry Laurie saw her, did n&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir; he passed all Sunday here, and only returned to town yesterday.
He spoke doubtfully,&mdash;I might even say, gloomily. He said, however,
that we cannot know anything for certain before Friday or, perhaps,
Saturday.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is fever, then?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he told my wife, the worst character of typhus.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Brought on, as I&rsquo;ve been told, by exposure to wet and cold on that night
at sea. Is n&rsquo;t that the case?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe so. Mrs. Nelligan went over the next morning to the cottage.
She had heard of poor Mr. Martin&rsquo;s death, and thought she might be of some
use to Miss Mary; but when she arrived, it was to find her in fever,
talking wildly, and insisting that she must be up and away to Kyle-a-Noe
to look after a poor sick family there.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Has Mrs. Nelligan seen her since that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She never left her,&mdash;never quitted her. She relieves Henderson&rsquo;s
daughter in watching beside her bed; for the old housekeeper is quite too
infirm to bear the fatigue.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What a sad change has come over this little spot, and in so brief a space
too! It seems just like yesterday that I was a guest at Cro&rsquo; Martin,&mdash;poor
Martin himself so happy and light-hearted; his dear girl, as he called
her, full of life and spirits. Your son was there the night I speak of. I
remember it well, for the madcap girls would make a fool of me, and
insisted on my singing them a song; and I shall not readily forget the
shame my compliance inflicted on my learned brother&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Joe told me of it afterwards.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, he told you, did he? He doubtless remarked with asperity on the
little sense of my own dignity I possessed?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;On the contrary, sir, he said, &lsquo;Great as are Mr. Rep-ton&rsquo;s gifts, and
brilliant as are his acquirements, I envy him more the happy buoyancy of
his nature than all his other qualities.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fine fellow, and it was a generous speech; not but I will be vain
enough to say he was right,&mdash;ay, sir, perfectly right. Of all the
blessings that pertain to temperament, there is not one to compare with
the spirit that renews in an old man the racy enjoyment of youth, keeps
his heart fresh and his mind hopeful. With these, age brings no terrors. I
shall be seventy-five, sir, if I live to the second of next month, and I
have not lived long enough to dull the enjoyment life affords me, nor
diminish the pleasure my heart derives upon hearing of a noble action or a
generous sentiment.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Nelligan gazed at the speaker in mingled astonishment and admiration.
Somehow, it was not altogether the man he had expected; but he was far
from being disappointed at the difference. The Valentine Repton of his
imagination was a crafty pleader, a subtle cross-examiner, an ingenious
flatterer of juries; but he was not a man whose nature was assailable by
anything &ldquo;not found in the books.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Now, though Nelligan was himself essentially a worldly man, he was touched
by these traits of one whom he had regarded as a hardened old lawyer,
distrustful and suspicious.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, sir,&rdquo; said Repton, as, leaning on the other&rsquo;s arm, he entered the
drawing-room, &ldquo;a wiser man than either of us has left it on record, that
after a long life and much experience of the world, he met far more of
good and noble qualities in mankind than of their opposite. Take my word
for it, whenever we are inclined to the contrary opinion, the fault lies
with ourselves.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
While they sat awaiting Massingbred&rsquo;s return, a servant entered with a
note, which Nelligan, having read, handed over to Repton. It was very
brief, and ran thus:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear Mr. Nelligan,&mdash;Forgive my not appearing at dinner, and make
my excuses to Mr. Repton, if he be with you, for I have just fallen in
with Magennis, who insists on carrying me off to Barnagheela. You can
understand, I &lsquo;m sure, that there are reasons why I could not well decline
this invitation. Meanwhile, till to-morrow, at breakfast,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am yours,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Jack Massingbred.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
If there was a little constraint on Nelligan&rsquo;s part at finding himself
alone to do the honors to his distinguished guest, the feeling soon wore
away, and a frank, hearty confidence was soon established between these
two men, who up to the present moment had been following very different
roads in life. Apart from a lurking soreness, the remnants of long-past
bitterness, Nelligan&rsquo;s political opinions were fair and moderate, and
agreed with Repton&rsquo;s now to a great extent. His views as to the people,
their habits and their natures, were also strikingly just and true. He was
not over-hopeful, nor was he despondent; too acute an observer to refer
their faults to any single source, he regarded their complex, intricate
characters as the consequence of many causes, the issue of many struggles.
There was about all he said the calm judgment of a man desirous of truth;
and yet, when he came to speak of the higher classes, the great country
gentry, he displayed prejudices and mistakes quite incredible in one of
his discernment. The old grudge of social disqualification had eaten deep
into his heart, and, as Repton saw, it would take at least two generations
of men, well-to-do and successful, to eradicate the sentiment.
</p>
<p>
Nelligan was quick enough to see that these opinions of his were not
shared by his guest, and said, &ldquo;I cannot expect, Mr. Repton, that you will
join me in these views; you have seen these people always as an equal, if
not their superior; they met <i>you</i> with their best faces and sweetest
flatteries. Not so with us. They draw a line, as though to say, go on:
make your fortunes; purchase estates; educate your children; send them to
the universities with our own; teach them our ways, our instincts, our
manners, and yet, at the end of all, you shall remain exactly where you
began. You shall never be &lsquo;of us.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am happy to say that I disagree with you,&rdquo; said Repton; &ldquo;I am a much
older man than you, and I can draw, therefore, on a longer experience. Now
the change that I myself have seen come over the tone and temper of the
world since I was a boy is far more marvellous to me than all the
new-fangled discoveries around us in steam and electricity. Why, sir, the
man who now addresses you, born of an ancient stock, as good blood as any
untitled gentleman of the land, was treated once as Jack Cade might be in
a London drawing-room. The repute of liberal notions or politics at that
day stamped you as a democrat and atheist If you sided with a popular
measure, you were deemed capable of all the crimes of a &lsquo;Danton.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do I not remember it!&mdash;Ay, as a student, young, ardent, and
high-hearted, when I was summoned before the visitors of the university,
and sternly asked by the dark-browed Lord Chancellor if I belonged to a
society called the &lsquo;Friends of Ireland,&rsquo; and on my acknowledging the fact,
without inquiry, without examination, deprived of my scholarship, and sent
back to my chambers, admonished to be more cautious, and menaced with
expulsion. I had very little to live on in those days; my family had
suffered great losses in fortune, and I disliked to be a burden to them. I
took pupils, therefore, to assist me in my support. The Vice-Provost
stepped in, however, and interdicted this. &lsquo;Young men,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;ran a
greater chance of coming out of my hands followers of Paine than disciples
of Newton.&rsquo; I starved on till I was called to the bar. There fresh insults
and mortifications met me. My name on a brief seemed a signal for a
field-day against Jacobinism and infidelity. The very bench forgot its
dignity in its zeal. I remember well one day, when, stung and maddened by
these outrages, I so far forgot myself as to reply, and the Court of
King&rsquo;s Bench was closed against me for twelve long years,&mdash;ay, till I
came back to it as the first man in my profession. It was a trumpery
cause,&mdash;I forget what; a suit about some petty bill of exchange. I
disputed the evidence, and sought to show its invalidity. The Chief
Justice stopped me, and said, &lsquo;The Court is aware of the point on which
you rely; we have known evidence of this nature admitted in cases of trial
for treason,&mdash;cases with which Mr. Repton, we know, is very familiar.
I stopped; my blood boiled with indignation, my temples throbbed to
bursting, to be thus singled out amongst my brethren&mdash;before the
public&mdash;as a mark of scorn and reprobation. &lsquo;It is true, my Lord,&rsquo;
said I, with a slow, measured utterance, &lsquo;I am familiar with such cases.
Who is there in this unhappy land that is not? I am aware, too, that if I
stood in that dock arraigned on such a charge, your Lordship would rule
that this evidence was admissible; you would charge against me, sentence,
and hang me; but the present is an action for eleven pounds ten, and,
therefore, I trust to your Lordship&rsquo;s lenity and mercy to reject it.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That reply, sir, cost me twelve years of exile from the court wherein I
uttered it. Those were times when the brow-beating judge could crush the
bar; nor were the jury always safe in the sanctuary of the jury-box. Now,
such abuses are no longer in existence; and if we have made no other
stride in progress, even that is considerable.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;In all that regards the law and its administration, I am sure you are
correct, sir,&rdquo; said Nelligan, submissively.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;At the period I speak of,&rdquo; resumed Repton, who now was only following out
his own thoughts and reminiscences, &ldquo;the judges were little else than
prefects, administering the country through the channel of the penal code,
and the jury a set of vulgar partisans, who wielded the power of a verdict
with all the caprice of a faction; and as to their ignorance, why, sir,
Crookshank, who afterwards sat on the bench, used to tell of a trial for
murder at Kells, where the &lsquo;murdered man&rsquo; was two hours under
cross-examination on the table! Yes, but that is not all; the jury retired
to deliberate, and came out at length with a verdict of &lsquo;manslaughter,&rsquo; as
the prisoner was &lsquo;a bad fellow, and had once stolen a saddle from the
foreman.&rsquo; You talk of law and civilization; why, I tell you, sir, that the
barbaric code of the red man is a higher agent of enlightenment than the
boasted institutions of England, when thus perverted and degraded. No, no,
Mr. Nelligan, it may be a fine theme for declamation, there may be grand
descriptive capabilities about the Ireland of sixty or seventy years ago,
but be assured, it was a social chaos of the worst kind; and as a maxim,
sir, remember, that the inhabitants of a country are never so much to be
pitied as when the aspect of their social condition is picturesque!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Repton fell into a musing fit when he had finished these observations, and
Nelligan felt too much deference for his guest to disturb him, and they
sat thus silent for some time, when the old lawyer suddenly arousing
himself, said,&mdash;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this I hear about disturbances, and
attacks on the police, down here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing political in it,&rdquo; rejoined Nelligan. &ldquo;It was resistance
offered by the people to the service of certain notices on the part of
this London Jew&mdash;Merl, I think they call him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the name,&rdquo; quickly responded Repton. &ldquo;You are aware of the
circumstances under which he claims the estate?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I had it from Brierley, who was told by Scanlan, that he purchased, or
rather won at play, the entire and sole reversion.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Repton nodded.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And such is a legal compact, I presume?&rdquo; said Nelligan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If the immoral obligation be well concealed in the negotiation, I don&rsquo;t
see how it is to be broken. The law, sir,&rdquo; added he, solemnly, &ldquo;never
undertakes the charge of fools till a commission be taken out in their
behalf! This young fellow&rsquo;s pleasure it was to squander his succession to
a princely estate, and he chanced to meet with one who could appreciate
his intentions.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Massingbred told me, however, that some arrangement, some compromise was
in contemplation; that Merl, knowing that to enforce his claim would
subject him to a trial and all its disclosures, had shown a disposition to
treat; in fact, Massingbred has already had an interview with him, and but
for Scanlan, who desires to push matters to extremity, the affair might
possibly be accommodated.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Jew possibly sees, too, that an Irish succession is not a bloodless
triumph. He has been frightened, I have no doubt.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe so; they say he took to his bed the day he got back here, and
has never quitted it since. The people hunted them for four miles across
the country, and as Merl couldn&rsquo;t leap his horse over the walls, they were
several times nearly caught by the delay in making gaps for him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have given fifty pounds to be in at it,&rdquo; broke out Repton. Then
suddenly remembering that the aspiration did not sound as very dignified,
he hemmed and corrected himself, saying, &ldquo;It must, indeed, have been a
strange spectacle!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They started at Kyle&rsquo;s Wood, and ran them over the low grounds beside
Kelly&rsquo;s Mills, and then doubling, brought them along the foot of
Barnagheela Mountain, where, it seems, Magennis joined the chase; he was
fast closing with them when his gun burst, and rather damaged his hand.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He fired, then?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0015" id="linkimage-0015">
<!-- IMG --></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/368.jpg" width="100%" alt="368 " />
</div>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he put a heavy charge of slugs into Merl&rsquo;s horse as he was getting
through the mill-race, and the beast flung up and threw his rider into the
stream. Scanlan dismounted and gathered him up, discharging his pistol at
some country fellow who was rushing forward; they say the man has lost an
eye. They got off, however, and, gaining the shelter of the Cro&rsquo; Martin
wood, they managed to escape at last, and reached this about six o&rsquo;clock,
their clothes in tatters, their horses lamed, and themselves lamentable
objects of fatigue and exhaustion. Since that, no one but the doctor has
seen Merl, and Scanlan only goes out with an escort of police.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;All this sounds very like &lsquo;sixty years ago,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Repton, laughing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it does, and I half dread what the English newspapers may say
under the heading of &lsquo;Galway Barbarities.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;By Jove! I must say I like it; that is,&rdquo; said Repton, hesitating and
confused, &ldquo;I can see some palliation for the people in such an outburst of
generous but misdirected feeling. The old name has still its spell for
their hearts; and even superstitions, sir, are better than incredulity!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But of what avail is all this? The law must and will be vindicated. It
may cost some lives, on the road, but Mr. Merl must reach his journey&rsquo;s
end, at last.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He may deem the sport, as I have known some men do tiger-hunting, not
worth the danger,&rdquo; said Repton. &ldquo;You and I, Mr. Nelligan, acclimated, as I
may say, to such incidents, would probably not decline the title to an
estate, whose first step in possession should be enforced by the
blunderbuss; but make the scene Africa, and say what extent of territory
would you accept of, on the compact of enforcing your claim against the
natives? Now, for all the purposes of argument, to this cockney&rsquo;s
appreciation, these countrymen of ours are Africans.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can well understand his terror,&rdquo; said Nelligan, thoughtfully. &ldquo;I &lsquo;m
sure the yell that followed him through the gap of Kyle-a-Noe will ring in
his heart for many a day. It was there the pursuit was hottest. As they
came out, a stranger, who had been here during the winter,&mdash;a Mr.
Barry&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What of <i>him?</i> What did <i>he</i> do?&rdquo; broke in Repton, with great
eagerness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He stood upon an old wall, and hurrahed the people on, calling out, &lsquo;Five
gold guineas to the man who will hurl that fellow into the lake.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He said that?&rdquo; cried Repton.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and waved his hat in encouragement to the mob! This was deposed in
evidence before the bench; and Scanlan&rsquo;s affidavit went on to say, that
when the temper of the people seemed to relent, and the ardor of their
pursuit to relax, this man&rsquo;s presence invariably rallied all the energies
of mischief, and excited the wildest passions of the populace.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who or what is he supposed to be?&rdquo; asked the lawyer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Some say, a returned convict,&mdash;a banker that was transported thirty
years ago for forgery; others, that he is Con O&rsquo;Hara, that killed Major
Stackpoole in the famous duel at Bunratty Castle. Magennis swears that he
remembers the face well; at all events, there is a mystery about him, and
when he came into the shop below stairs&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, then, you have seen him yourself?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; he came in on Monday last, and asked for some glazed gunpowder, and
if we had bullets of a large mould to fit his pistols. They were
curiosities in their way; they were made in America, and had a bore large
as your thumb.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You had some conversation with him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A few words about the country and the crops. He said he thought we had
good prospects for the wheat, and, if we should have a fine harvest, a
good winter was like to follow. Meaning that, with enough to eat, we
should have fewer outrages in the dark nights, and by that I knew he was
one acquainted with the country. I said as much, and then he turned
fiercely on me, and remarked, &lsquo;I never questioned you, sir, about your
hides and tallow and ten-penny nails, for they were <i>your</i> affairs;
please, then, to pay the same deference to <i>me</i> and <i>mine</i>.&rsquo; And
before I could reply he was gone.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was a rude speech,&rdquo; said Repton, thoughtfully; &ldquo;but many men are
morose from circumstances whose natures are full of kindliness and
gentleness.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was precisely the impression this stranger made upon me. There was
that in his manner which implied a hard lot in life,&mdash;no small share
of the shadiest side of fortune; and even when his somewhat coarse rebuke
was uttered, I was more disposed to be angry with myself for being the
cause than with him who made it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where is he stopping just now?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;At Kilkieran, I have heard; but he has been repeatedly back and forward
in the town here during the week, though for the last few days I have not
seen him. Perhaps he has heard of Scanlan&rsquo;s intention to summons him for
aiding and abetting an assault, and has kept out of the way in
consequence.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>He</i> keep out of the way!&rdquo; cried Repton; &ldquo;you never mistook a man
more in your life!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are acquainted with him, then?&rdquo; said Nelligan, in amazement.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That am I, sir. No one knows him better, and on my knowledge of the man
it was that I apologized for his incivility to yourself. If I cannot say
more, Mr. Nelligan, it is not because I have any mistrust in your
confidence, but that my friend&rsquo;s secret is, in his own charge, and only to
be revealed at his own pleasure.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish you would tell him that I never meant to play the spy upon him,&mdash;that
my remark was a merely chance observation&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I promise you to do so,&rdquo; broke in Repton. &ldquo;I promise you still more, that
before he leaves this you shall have an apology from his own lips for his
accidental rudeness; nay, two men that would know how to respect each
other should never part under even a passing misunderstanding. It is an
old theory of mine, Mr. Nelligan, that good men&rsquo;s good opinions of us form
the pleasantest store of our reminiscences, and I &lsquo;d willingly go a
hundred miles to remove a misconception that might bring me back to the
esteem of an honorable heart, though I never were to set eyes again on him
who possessed it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I like your theory well, sir,&rdquo; said Nelligan, cordially.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You &lsquo;ll find the practice will reward you,&rdquo; said Repton.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I confess this stranger has inspired me with great curiosity.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can well understand the feeling,&rdquo; said Repton, musing. &ldquo;It is with men
as with certain spots in landscape, there are chance glimpses which
suggest to us the fair scenes that lie beyond our view! Poor fellow! poor
fellow!&rdquo; muttered he once or twice to himself; and then starting abruptly,
said, &ldquo;You have made me so cordially welcome here that I am going to
profit by every privilege of a guest. I &lsquo;m going to say good-night, for I
have much before me on the morrow.&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER XXXV. HOW DIPLOMACY FAILED
</h2>
<p>
Repton was up at daybreak, and at his desk. Immense folios littered the
table, and even the floor around him, and the old lawyer sat amidst a
chaos that it was difficult to believe was only the growth of an hour or
two. All the intentness of his occupation, however, did not prevent him
hearing a well-known voice in the little stable-yard beneath his window,
and opening the sash he called out, &ldquo;Mas-singbred, is that you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Mr. Repton, are you stirring so early? I had not expected to see you
for at least two hours to come. May I join you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;By all means; at once,&rdquo; was the answer. And the next moment they were
together. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Barry? When did you see him last?&rdquo; was Repton&rsquo;s first
question.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;For a moment, on Tuesday last; he came up here to learn if you had
arrived, or when you might be expected. He seemed disappointed when I said
not before the latter end of the week, and muttered something about being
too late. He seemed flurried and excited. I heard afterwards that he had
been somehow mixed up with that tumultuous assemblage that resisted the
police, and I offered to go back with him to Kilkieran, but he stopped me
short, saying, &lsquo;I am not at Kilkieran;&rsquo; and so abruptly as to show that my
proposal was not acceptable. He then sat down and wrote a short letter,
which he desired me to give you on arriving; but to deliver it with my own
hand, as, if any reply were necessary, I should be ready to carry it to
him. This is the letter.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Repton read it rapidly, and then, walking to the window, stood pondering
over the contents.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You know this man Merl, don&rsquo;t you, Massingbred?&rdquo; asked Repton.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, thoroughly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The object of this letter is to try one last chance for an arrangement.
Barry suspects that the Jew&rsquo;s ambition for Irish proprietorship may have
been somewhat dashed by the experience of the last few days; that he will
be likely enough to weigh the advantages and disadvantages with a juster
appreciation than if he had never come here, and, if such be the case, we
are ready to meet with a fair and equitable offer. We&rsquo;ll repay him all
that he advanced in cash to young Martin, and all that he won from him at
play, if he surrender his reversionary claim. We&rsquo;ll ask no questions as to
how this loan was made, or how that debt incurred. It shall be the
briefest of all transactions,&mdash;a sum in simple addition, and a check
for the total.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll refuse,&mdash;flatly refuse it,&rdquo; said Massingbred. &ldquo;The very offer
will restore any confidence the last few days may have shaken; he&rsquo;ll judge
the matter like the shares of a stock that are quoted higher in the
market.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it. I&rsquo;m ashamed to say, Mr. Repton, that my knowledge of the
Herman Merl class may be greater than yours. It is the one solitary point
in the realm of information wherein I am probably your superior.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There are others, and of a very different order, in which I would own you
the master,&rdquo; said Repton. &ldquo;But to our case. Suppose,&mdash;a mere
supposition, if you like,&mdash;but suppose that it could be demonstrated
to Mr. Merl that his claim will be not only resisted, but defeated; that
the right on which he relies is valueless,&mdash;the deed not worth the
stamps it bears; that this offer is made to avoid a publicity and exposure
far more injurious to him than to those who now shrink from it. What think
you then?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Simply that he&rsquo;d not believe it! He&rsquo;d say, and many others would say, &lsquo;If
the right lay so incontestably with these others, they &lsquo;d not give some
twenty thousand pounds to compromise what they could enforce for the mere
cost of a trial.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Massingbred, too, would perhaps take the same view of the
transaction,&rdquo; said Repton, half tartly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not if Mr. Repton assured me that he backed the opposite opinion,&rdquo; said
Jack, politely.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I thank you heartily for that speech,&rdquo; said the old man, as he grasped
the other&rsquo;s hand cordially; &ldquo;you deserve, and shall have my fullest
confidence.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;if this offer to buy off Merl be made in the
interest of the Martins, for otherwise I really see no great object, so
far as they are concerned, in the change of mastery?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to take <i>my</i> word for that,&rdquo; said Repton, &ldquo;or rather, to
take the part I assume in this transaction as the evidence of it; and now,
as I see that you are satisfied, will you accept of the duty of this
negotiation? Will you see and speak with Merl? Urge upon him all the
arguments your own ingenuity will furnish, and when you come, if you
should be so driven, to the coercive category, and that you want the siege
artillery, then send for <i>me</i>. Depend upon it, it will be no <i>brutum
fulmen</i> that I &lsquo;ll bring up; nor will I, as Pelham said, fire with
‘government powder.&rsquo; My cannon shall be inscribed, like those of the old
volunteers, independence or&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
At any other moment Jack might have smiled at the haughty air and martial
stride of the old man, as, stimulated by his words, he paced the room; but
there was a sincerity and a resolution about him that offered no scope for
ridicule. His very features wore a look of intrepidity that bespoke the
courage that animated him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now, Massingbred,&rdquo; said he, laying his hand on the young man&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;it
is only because I am not free to tell another man&rsquo;s secret that I do not
at once place you fully in possession of all I myself know of this
transaction; but rely on it, you shall be informed on every point, and
immediately after the issue of this negotiation with Merl, whatever be the
result, you shall stand on the same footing with myself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You cannot suppose that I exact this confidence?&rdquo; began Jack.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I only know it is your due, sir,&rdquo; said Repton. &ldquo;Go now,&mdash;it is not
too early; see this man, and let the meeting be of the briefest, for if I
were to tell you my own mind, I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;d rather he should reject our
offer.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are, I own, a little incomprehensible this morning,&rdquo; said
Massingbred, &ldquo;but I am determined to yield you a blind obedience; and so
I&rsquo;m off.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;ll wait breakfast for you,&rdquo; said Repton, as he reseated himself to his
work.
</p>
<p>
Repton requested Mr. Nelligan&rsquo;s permission to have his breakfast served in
his own room, and sat for a long time impatiently awaiting Massingbred&rsquo;s
return. He was at one time aroused by a noise below stairs, but it was not
the announcement of him he looked for; and he walked anxiously to and fro
in his chamber, each moment adding to the uneasiness that he felt.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who was it that arrived half an hour ago?&rdquo; asked he of the servant.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Joe, sir, the counsellor, has just come from Dublin, and is at
breakfast with the master.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah! he &lsquo;s come, is he? So much the better,&rdquo; muttered Repton, &ldquo;we may want
his calm, clear head to assist us here; not that we shall have to fear a
contest,&mdash;there is no enemy in the field,&mdash;and if there were,
Val Repton is ready to meet him!&rdquo; And the old man crossed his arms, and
stood erect in all the consciousness of his undiminished vigor. &ldquo;Here he
comes at last,&mdash;I know his step on the stair.&rdquo; And he flung open the
door for Massingbred.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I read failure in your flushed cheek, Massingbred; failure and anger
both, eh?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Massingbred tried to smile. If there was any quality on which he
especially prided himself, it was the bland semblance of equanimity he
could assume in circumstances of difficulty and irritation. It was his
boast to be able to hide his most intense emotions at moments of passion,
and there was a period in which, indeed, he wielded this acquirement. Of
later times, however, he had grown more natural and impulsive; he had not
yet lost the sense of pain this yielding occasioned, and it was with
evident irritation that he found Repton had read his thoughts.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You perceive, then, that I am unsuccessful?&rdquo; said he, with a faint smile.
&ldquo;So much the better if my face betrays me; it will save a world of
explanation!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Make your report, sir, and I&rsquo;ll make the tea,&rdquo; said Repton, as he
proceeded to that office.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The fellow was in bed,&mdash;he refused to see me, and it was only by
some insistence that I succeeded in gaining admittance. He has had leeches
to his temples. He was bruised, it seems, when he fell, but far more
frightened than hurt. He looks the very picture of terror, and lies with a
perfect armory of pistols beside his bed. Scanlan was there, and thought
to remain during our interview; but I insisted on his withdrawing, and he
went. The amiable attorney, somehow, has a kind of respect for me that is
rather amusing. As for Merl, he broke out into a vulgar tirade of passion,
abused the country and the people, cursed the hour he came amongst them,
and said, if he only knew the nature of the property before he made his
investment, he &lsquo;d rather have purchased Guatemala bonds, or Santa Fé
securities.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Then I have come fortunately,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;for I bring you an offer to
reimburse all your outlay, and to rid you of a charge so little to your
inclination.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! you do, do you?&rsquo; said he, with one of his cunningest leers. &lsquo;You may
not be able, perhaps, to effect that bargain, though. It&rsquo;s one thing to
pay down a smart sum of money and wait your time for recovering it, and
it&rsquo;s another to surrender your compact when the hour of acquisition has
arrived. I bought this reversion&mdash;at least, I paid the first
instalment of the price&mdash;four years ago, when the late man&rsquo;s life was
worth twenty years&rsquo; purchase. Well, he &lsquo;s gone now, and do you think that
I &lsquo;m going to give up my claim for what it cost me?&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I gently insinuated that the investigation of the claim might lead to
unpleasant revelations. There were various incidents of the play-table,
feasible and successful enough after a supper with champagne, and in the
short hours before day, which came off with an ill-grace on the table of a
court of justice, with three barons of the exchequer to witness them. That
I myself might prove an awkward evidence, if unhappily cited to appear;
that of my own knowledge I could mention three young fellows of good
fortune who had been drained to their last shilling in his company. In
fact, we were both remarkably candid with each other, and while <i>I</i>
reminded <i>him</i> of some dark passages at <i>écarté, he</i> brought to
<i>my</i> memory certain protested bills and dishonored notes that &lsquo;non
jucundum esset meminisse.&rsquo; I must say, for both of us, we did the thing
well, and in good breeding; we told and listened to our several
shortcomings with a temper that might have graced a better cause, and I
defy the world to produce two men who could have exchanged the epithets of
swindler and scamp with more thorough calm and good manners. Unhappily,
however, high as one rises in his own esteem by such contests, he scarcely
makes the same ascent in that of his neighbor, and so we came, in our
overflowing frankness, to admit to each other more of our respective
opinions than amounts to flattery. I believe, and, indeed, I hope, I
should have maintained my temper to the end, had not the fellow pretty
broadly insinuated that some motive of personal advantage had prompted my
interference, and actually pushed his insolence so far as to insinuate
that &lsquo;I should make a better thing&rsquo; by adhering to his fortunes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Repton started at these words, and Massingbred resumed: &ldquo;True, upon my
honor; I exaggerate nothing. It was a gross outrage, and very difficult to
put up with; so I just expressed my sincere regret that instead of being
in bed he was not up and stirring, inasmuch as I should have tried what
change of air might have done for him, by pitching him out of the window.
He tugged violently at the bell-rope, as though I were about to execute my
menace, and so I left him. My diplomacy has, therefore, been a sad
failure. I only hope that I may not have increased the difficulty of the
case by my treatment of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You never thought of <i>me</i> at all, then?&rdquo; asked Repton.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never, till I was once more in the street; then I remembered something of
what you said about coercive means, but of what avail a mere menace? This
fellow is not new to such transactions,&mdash;he has gone through all the
phases of &lsquo;bulleydom.&rsquo; Besides, there is a dash of Shylock in every Jew
that ever breathed. They will &lsquo;have their bond,&rsquo; unless it can be
distinctly proved to them that the thing is impossible.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now then for our breaching battery,&rdquo; said Repton, rising and pacing the
room. &ldquo;This attempt at a compromise never had any favor in my eyes; Barry
wished it, and I yielded. Now for a very different course. Can you find a
saddle-horse here? Well, then, be ready to set out in half an hour, and
search out Barry for me. He&rsquo;ll be found at Kilkieran, or the neighborhood;
say we must meet at once; arrange time and place for the conference, and
come back to me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Repton issued his directions with an air of command, and Massingbred
prepared as implicitly to obey them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Nelligan has lent me his own pad,&rdquo; said Massingbred, entering soon
after, &ldquo;and his son will accompany me, so that I am at your orders at
once.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There are your despatches,&rdquo; said Repton, giving him a sealed packet. &ldquo;Let
me see you here as soon as may be.&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER XXXVI. A GREAT DISCOVERY
</h2>
<p>
About an hour after Massingbred&rsquo;s departure for Kilkieran, Mr. Repton set
out for Cro&rsquo; Martin Castle. The inn had furnished him its best chaise and
four of its primest horses; and had the old lawyer been disposed to enjoy
the pleasure which a great moralist has rated so highly, of rapid motion
through the air, he might have been gratified on that occasion. Unhappily,
however, he was not so minded. Many and very serious cares pressed upon
him. He was travelling a road, too, which he had so often journeyed in
high spirits, fancying to himself the pleasant welcome before him, and
even rehearsing to his own mind the stores of agreeability he was to
display,&mdash;and now it was to a deserted mansion, lonely and desolate,
he was turning! Death and ruin both had done their work on that ancient
family, whose very name in the land seemed already hastening to oblivion!
</p>
<p>
Few men could resist the influence of depression better than Repton. It
was not alone that his temperament was still buoyant and energetic, but
the habits of his profession had taught him the necessity of being
prepared for emergencies, and he would have felt it a dereliction of duty
were his sentiments to overmaster his power of action.
</p>
<p>
Still, as he went along, the well-known features of the spot would recall
memories of the past. There lay a dense wood, of which he remembered the
very day, the very hour, poor Martin had commenced the planting. There was
the little trout-stream, where, under pretence of fishing, he had lounged
along the summer day, with Horace for his companion; that, the
school-house Mary had sketched, and built out of her own pocket-money. And
now the great massive gates slowly opened, and they were within the
demesne,&mdash;all silent and noiseless. As they came in sight of the
castle, Repton covered his face with his hands, and sat for some minutes
thus. Then, as if mastering his emotion, he raised his head and folded his
arms on his chest.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are true to time, I perceive, Dr. Leslie,&rdquo; said he, as the chaise
stopped at the door and the venerable clergyman came forward to greet him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I got your note last night, sir, but I determined not to keep you
waiting, for I perceive you say that time is precious now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I thank you heartily,&rdquo; said Repton, as he shook the other&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I am
grateful to you also for being here to meet me, for I begin to feel my
courage fail me as to crossing that threshold again!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Age has its penalties as well as its blessings, sir,&rdquo; said Leslie, &ldquo;and
amongst these is to outlive those dear to us!&rdquo; There was a painful
significance to his own desolate condition that made these words doubly
impressive.
</p>
<p>
Repton made no reply, but pulled the bell strongly; and the loud, deep
sounds rung out clearly through the silent house. After a brief interval a
small window above the door was opened, and a man with a blunderbuss in
his hand sternly demanded their business.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I ax pardon, sir,&rdquo; said he, as suddenly correcting himself. &ldquo;I
thought it was that man that &lsquo;s come to take the place,&mdash;&lsquo;the Jew,&rsquo;
they call him,&mdash;and Mr. Magennis said I was n&rsquo;t to let him in, or one
belonging to him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, Barney, we are not his friends,&rdquo; said Dr. Leslie; &ldquo;this is Mr.
Repton.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sure I know the Counsellor well, sir,&rdquo; said Barney. &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll be down in a
minute and open the door.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I must go to work at once,&rdquo; said Repton, in a low and somewhat broken
voice, &ldquo;or this place will be too much for me. Every step I go is calling
up old times and old scenes. I had thought my heart was of sterner stuff.
Isn&rsquo;t this the way to the library? No, not that way,&mdash;that was poor
Martin&rsquo;s own breakfast-room!&rdquo; He spoke hurriedly, like one who wished to
suppress emotion by very activity of thought.
</p>
<p>
While the man who conducted them opened the window-shutters and the
windows, Repton and his companion sat down without speaking. At last he
withdrew, and Repton, rising, said,&mdash;&ldquo;Some of the happiest hours of
my life were passed in this same room. I used to come up here after the
fatigues of circuit, and, throwing myself into one of those easy-chairs,
dream away for a day or two, gazing out on that bold mountain yonder,
above the trees, and wondering how those fellows who never relaxed, in
this wise, could sustain the wear and tear of life; for that junketing to
Harrow-gate, that rattling, noisy steamboating up the Rhine, that Cockney
heroism of Swiss travel, is my aversion. The calm forenoon for thought,
the pleasant dinner-table for genial enjoyment afterwards,&mdash;these are
true recreations. And what evenings we have had here! But I must not dwell
on these.&rdquo; And now he threw upon the table a mass of papers and letters,
amongst which he sought out one, from which he took a small key. &ldquo;Dr.
Leslie,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you might have been assured that I have not called upon
you to meet me to-day without a sufficient reason. I know that, from
certain causes, of which I am not well informed, you were not on terms of
much intimacy with my poor friend here. This is not a time to think of
these things; <i>you</i>, I am well assured, will never remember them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Leslie made a motion of assent; and the other went on, his voice gradually
gaining in strength and fulness, and his whole manner by degrees assuming
the characteristic of the lawyer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To the few questions to which I will ask your answers, now, I have to
request all your attention. They are of great importance; they may, very
probably, be re-asked of you under more solemn circumstances; and I have
to bespeak, not alone all your accuracy for the replies, but that you may
be able, if asked, to state the manner and even the words in which I now
address you.&mdash;You have been the incumbent of this parish for a length
of time,&mdash;what number of years?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sixty-three. I was appointed to the vicarage on my ordination, and never
held any other charge.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You knew the late Darcy Martin, father of the last proprietor of this
estate?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Intimately.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You baptized his two children, born at the same birth. State what you
remember of the circumstance.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was sent for to the castle to give a private baptism to the two
infants, and requested that I would bring the vestry-book along with me
for the registration. I did so. The children were accordingly christened,
and their births duly registered and witnessed.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Can you remember the names by which they were called?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not from the incident in question, though I know the names from
subsequent knowledge of them, as they grew up to manhood.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What means, if any, were adopted at the time to distinguish the priority
of birth?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The eldest was first baptized, and his birth specially entered in the
vestry-book as such; all the witnesses who signed the entry corroborating
the fact by special mention of it under their signature. We also heard
that the child wore a gold bracelet on one arm; but I did not remark it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have this vestry-book in your keeping?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; Mr. Martin retained it, with some object of more formal registration.
I repeatedly asked for it, but never could obtain it. At length some
coolness grew up between us, and I could not, or did not wish to press my
demand; and at last it lapsed entirely from my memory, so that from that
day I never saw it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You could, however, recognize it, and be able to verify your signature?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Was there, so far as you could see, any marked distinction made between
the children while yet young?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can remember that at the age of three or four the eldest boy wore a
piece of red or blue ribbon on his sleeve; but any other mark I never
observed. They were treated, so far as I could perceive, precisely alike;
and their resemblance to each other was then so striking, it would have
been a matter of great nicety to distinguish them. Even at school, I am
told, mistakes constantly occurred, and one boy once received the
punishment incurred by the other.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;As they grew up, you came to recognize the eldest by his name?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Old Mr. Darcy Martin used to take the elder boy more about with him.
He was then a child of ten or eleven years old. He was particular in
calling attention to him, saying, &lsquo;This fellow is to be my heir; he &lsquo;ll be
the Martin of Cro&rsquo; Martin yet&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what name did the boy bear?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Godfrey,&mdash;Godfrey Martin. The second boy&rsquo;s name was Barry.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are sure of this?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Quite sure. I have dined a number of times at the castle, when Godfrey
was called in after dinner, and the other boy was generally in disgrace;
and I could remark that his father spoke of him in a tone of irritation
and bitterness, which he did not employ towards the other.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Martin died before his sons came of age?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; they were only nineteen at his death.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He made a will, I believe, to which you were a witness?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was; but somehow the will was lost or mislaid, and it was only by a
letter to the Honorable Colonel Forbes, of Lisvally, that Martin&rsquo;s
intentions about appointing him guardian to his elder boy were
ascertained. I myself was named guardian to the second son, an office of
which he soon relieved me by going abroad, and never returned for a number
of years.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Godfrey Martin then succeeded to the estate in due course?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and we were very intimate for a time, till after his marriage, when
estrangement grew up between us, and at last we ceased to visit at all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Were the brothers supposed to be on good terms with each other?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have heard two opposite versions on that subject. My own impression was
that Lady Dorothea disliked Barry Martin, who had made a marriage that was
considered beneath him; and then his brother was, from easiness of
disposition, gradually weaned of his old affection for him. Many thought
Barry, with all his faults, the better-hearted of the two.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Can you tell what ultimately became of this Barry Martin?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I only know, from common report, that after the death of his wife, having
given his infant child, a girl, in charge to his brother, he engaged in
the service of some of the Southern American Republics, and is supposed
yet to be living there,&mdash;some say in great affluence; others, that he
is utterly ruined by a failure in a mining speculation. The last time I
ever heard Godfrey speak of him was in terms of sincere affection, adding
the words, &lsquo;Poor Barry will befriend every one but himself.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So that he never returned?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe not; at least I never heard of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have written down these questions and your answers to them,&rdquo; said
Repton; &ldquo;will you read them over, and if you find them correct, append
your signature. I am expecting Mr. Nelligan here, and I &lsquo;ll go and see if
there be any sign of his arrival.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Repton just reached the door as Mr. Nelligan drove up to it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;All goes on well and promptly to-day,&rdquo; said the old lawyer. &ldquo;I have got
through a good deal of business already, and I expect to do as much more
ere evening sets in. I have asked you to be present, as a magistrate,
while I examine the contents of a certain closet in this house. I am led
to believe that very important documents are deposited there, and it is in
your presence, and that of Mr. Leslie, I purpose to make the inquiry.
Before I do so, however, I will entreat your attention to a number of
questions, and the answers to them, which will be read out to you. You
will then be in a better position to judge of any discovery which the
present investigation may reveal. All this sounds enigmatically enough,
Mr. Nelligan; but you will extend your patience to me for a short while,
and I hope to repay it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Nelligan bowed in silence, and followed him into the house.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Mr. Leslie, &ldquo;I have written my name to that paper; it is, so
far as I can see, perfectly correct.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now, let me read it for Mr. Nelligan,&rdquo; said Repton; and, without further
preface, recited aloud the contents of the document. &ldquo;I conclude, sir,&rdquo;
 said he, as he finished, &ldquo;that there is nothing in what you have just
heard very new or very strange to your ears. You knew before that Darcy
Martin had two sons; that they were twins; and that one of them, Godfrey,
inherited the estate. You may also have heard something of the brother&rsquo;s
history; more, perhaps, than is here alluded to.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have always heard him spoken of as a wild, reckless fellow, and that it
was a piece of special good fortune he was not born to the property, or he
had squandered every shilling of it,&rdquo; said Nelligan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Leslie, &ldquo;such was the character he bore.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said Repton, rising. &ldquo;Now, gentlemen, I&rsquo;m about to unlock
this cabinet, and, if I be correctly informed, we shall find the
vestry-book with the entries spoken of by Mr. Leslie, and the long missing
will of Darcy Martin. Such, I repeat, are the objects I expect to
discover; and it is in your presence I proceed to this examination.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In some astonishment at his words, the others followed him to the corner
of the room, where, half concealed in the wainscot, a small door was at
length discovered, unlocking which, Repton and the others entered a little
chamber, lighted by a narrow, loopholed window. Not stopping to examine
the shelves loaded with old documents and account-books, Repton walked
straight to a small ebony cabinet, on a bracket, opening which, he drew
forth a square vellum-bound book, with massive clasps.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The old vestry-book. I know it well,&rdquo; said Leslie.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here are the documents in parchment,&rdquo; continued Repton, &ldquo;and a sealed
paper. What are the lines in the corner, Mr. Nelligan,&mdash;your eyes are
better than mine?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Agreement between Godfrey and Barry Martin. To be opened by whichever
shall survive the other.&rsquo; The initials of each are underneath.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;With this we have no concern,&rdquo; said Repton; &ldquo;our business lies with
these.&rdquo; And he pointed to the vestry-book. &ldquo;Let us look for the entry you
spoke of.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is easily found,&rdquo; said Leslie. &ldquo;It was the last ever made in that
book. Here it is.&rdquo; And he read aloud: &ldquo;&lsquo;February 8th, 1772. Privately
baptized, at Cro&rsquo; Martin Castle, by me, Henry Leslie, Incumbent and Vicar
of the said parish, Barry and Godfrey, sons of Darcy Martin and Eleanor
his wife, both born on the fourth day of the aforesaid month; and, for the
better discrimination of their priority in age, it is hereby added that
Barry Martin is the elder, and Godfrey the second son, to which fact the
following are attesting witnesses: Michael Keirn, house-steward; George
Dorcas, butler; and Catharine Broon, maid of still-room.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is that in your handwriting, sir?&rdquo; asked Repton.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, every word of it, except the superscription of the witnesses.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, then it would appear that the eldest son never enjoyed his rights,&rdquo;
 cried Nelligan. &ldquo;Is that possible?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is the strict truth, sir,&rdquo; said Repton. &ldquo;The whole history of the case
adds one to the thousand instances of the miserable failures men make who
seek by the indulgence of their own caprices to obstruct the decrees of
Providence. Darcy Martin died in the belief that he had so succeeded; and
here, now, after more than half a century, are the evidences which reverse
his whole policy, and subvert all his plans.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But what could have been the object here?&rdquo; asked Nelligan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Simply his preference for the younger-born. No sooner had the children
arrived at that time of life when dispositions display themselves, than he
singled out Godfrey as his favorite. He distinguished him in every way,
and as markedly showed that he felt little affection for the other.
Whether this favoritism, so openly expressed, had its influence on the
rest of the household, or that really they grew to believe that the boy
thus selected for peculiar honor was the heir, it would be very difficult
now to say. Each cause may have contributed its share; all we know is,
that when sent to Dr. Harley&rsquo;s school, at Oughterard, Godfrey was called
the elder, and distinguished as such by a bit of red ribbon in his
button-hole. And thus they grew up to youth and manhood,&mdash;the one
flattered, indulged, and caressed; the other equally depreciated and
undervalued. Men are, in a great measure, what others make them. Godfrey
became proud, indolent, and overbearing; Barry, reckless and a spendthrift
Darcy Martin died, and Godfrey succeeded him as matter of course; while
Barry, disposing of the small property bequeathed to him, set out to seek
adventures in the Spanish Main.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am not able to tell, had you even the patience to hear, of what befell
him there; the very strangest, wildest incidents are recorded of his life,
but they have no bearing on what we are now engaged in. He came back,
however, with a wife, to find his brother also married. This is a period
of his life of which little is known. The brothers did not live well
together. There were serious differences between them; and Lady Dorothea&rsquo;s
conduct towards her sister-in-law, needlessly cruel and offensive, as I
have heard, imbittered the relations between them. At last Barry&rsquo;s wife
died, it was said, of a broken heart, and Barry arrived at Cro&rsquo; Martin to
deposit his infant child with his brother, and take leave of home and
country forever.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Some incident of more than usual importance, and with circumstances of no
common pain, must now have occurred; for one night Barry left the castle,
vowing nevermore to enter it. Godfrey followed, and tried to detain him. A
scene ensued of entreaty on one side, and passionate vehemence on the
other, which brought some of the servants to the spot. Godfrey imperiously
ordered them away; they all obeyed but Catty. Catty Broon followed Barry,
and never quitted him that night, which he spent walking up and down the
long avenue of the demesne, watching and waiting for daybreak. We can only
conjecture what, in the violence of her grief and indignation, this old
attached follower of the house might have revealed. Barry had always been
her favorite of the two boys; she knew his rights; she had never forgotten
them. She could not tell by what subtleties of law they had been
transferred to another, but she felt in her heart assured that in the
sight of God they were sacred. How far, then, she revealed this to him, or
only hinted it, we have no means of knowing. We can only say that, armed
with a certain fact, Barry demanded the next day a formal meeting with his
brother and his sister-in-law. Of what passed then and there, no record
remains, save, possibly, in that sealed packet; for it bears the date of
that eventful morning. I, however, am in a position to prove that Barry
declared he would not disturb the possession Godfrey was then enjoying.
‘Make that poor child,&rsquo; said he, alluding to his little girl, your own
daughter, and it matters little what becomes of <i>me</i>.&rsquo; Godfrey has
more than once adverted to this distressing scene to me. He told me how
Lady Dorothea&rsquo;s passion was such that she alternately inveighed against
himself for having betrayed her into a marriage beneath her, and abjectly
implored Barry not to expose them to the shame and disgrace of the whole
world by the assertion of his claim. From this she would burst out into
fits of open defiance of him, daring him as an impostor; in fact, Martin
said, &lsquo;That morning has darkened my life forever; the shadow of it will be
over me to the last hour I live!&rsquo; And so it was! Self-reproach never left
him: at one time, for his usurpation of what never was his; at another,
for the neglect of poor Mary, who was suffered to grow up without any care
of her education, or, indeed, of any attention whatever bestowed upon her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe that, in spite of herself, Lady Dorothea visited the dislike
she bore Barry on his daughter. It was a sense of hate from the
consciousness of a wrong,&mdash;one of the bitterest sources of enmity! At
all events, she showed her little affection,&mdash;no tenderness. Poor
Godfrey did all that his weak and yielding nature would permit to repair
this injustice; his consciousness that to that girl&rsquo;s father he owed
position, fortune, station, everything, was ever rising up in his mind,
and urging him to some generous effort in her behalf. But you knew him;
you knew how a fatal indolence, a shrinking horror of whatever demanded
action or energy overcame all his better nature, and made him as useless
to all the exigencies of life as one whose heart was eaten up by
selfishness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The remainder of this sad story is told in very few words. Barry Martin,
from whom for several years before no tidings had been received, came
suddenly back to England. At first it had not been his intention to
revisit Ireland. There was something of magnanimity in the resolve to stay
away. He would not come back to impose upon his brother a renewal of that
lease of gratitude he derived from him; he would rather spare him the
inevitable conflict of feeling which the contrast of his own affluence
with the humble condition of an exile would evoke. Besides, he was one of
those men whom, whatever Nature may have disposed them to be, the world
has so crushed and hardened that they live rather to indulge strong
resentments and stern duties than to gratify warm affections. Something he
had accidentally heard in a coffee-room&mdash;the chance mention by a
traveller recently returned from Ireland&mdash;about a young lady of rank
and fortune whom he had met hunting her own harriers alone in the wildest
glen of Connemara, decided him to go over there, and, under the name of
Mr. Barry, to visit the scenes of his youth.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have but to tell you that it was in that dreary month of November, when
plague and famine came together upon us, that he saw this country; the
people dying on every side, the land until led, the very crops in some
places uncut, terror and dismay on every side, and they who alone could
have inspired confidence, or afforded aid, gone! Even Cro&rsquo; Martin was
deserted,&mdash;worse than deserted; for one was left to struggle alone
against difficulties that the boldest and the bravest might have shrunk
from. Had Barry Martin been like any other man, he would at once have
placed himself at her side. It was a glorious occasion to have shown her
that she was not the lone and friendless orphan, but the loved and
cherished child of a doting father. But the hard, stern nature of the man
had other and very different impulses; and though he tracked her from
cottage to cottage, followed her in her lonely rambles, and watched her in
her daily duties, no impulse of affection ever moved him to call her his
daughter and bring her home to his heart. I know not whether it was to
afford him these occasions of meeting her, or really in a spirit of
benevolence, but he dispensed large sums in acts of charity among the
people, and Mary herself recounted to me, with tears of delight in her
eyes, the splendid generosity of this unknown stranger. I must hasten on.
An accident, the mere circumstance of a note-book dropped by some strange
chance in Barry&rsquo;s room, revealed to him the whole story of Captain
Martin&rsquo;s spendthrift life; he saw that this young man had squandered away
not only immense sums obtained by loans, but actually bartered his own
reversionary right to the entire estate for money already lost at the
gaming-table.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Barry at once set out for Dublin to call upon me and declare himself; but
I was, unfortunately, absent at the assizes. He endeavored next to see
Scanlan. Scanlan was in London; he followed him there. To Scanlan he
represented himself as a money-lender, who, having come to the knowledge
of Merl&rsquo;s dealings with young Martin, and the perilous condition of the
property in consequence, offered his aid to re-purchase the reversion
while it was yet time. To effect this bargain, Scanlan hastened over to
Baden, accompanied by Barry, who, however, for secrecy&rsquo; sake, remained at
a town in the neighborhood. Scanlan, it seems, resolved to profit by an
emergency so full of moment, and exacted from Lady Dorothea&mdash;for
Martin was then too ill to be consulted&mdash;the most advantageous terms
for himself. I need not mention one of the conditions,&mdash;a formal
consent to his marriage with Miss Martin! and this, remember, when that
young lady had not the slightest, vaguest suspicion that such an indignity
could be offered her, far less concurred in by her nearest relatives! In
the exuberance of his triumph, Scanlan showed the formal letter of assent
from Lady Dorothea to Barry. It was from this latter I had the account,
and I can give you no details, for all he said was, &lsquo;As I crushed it in my
hand, I clenched my fist to fell him to the ground! but I refrained. I
muttered a word or two, and got out into the street. I know very little
more.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That night he set out for Baden; but of his journey I know nothing. The
only hint of it he ever dropped was when, giving me this key, he said, &lsquo;I
saw Godfrey.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He is now back here once more; come to insist upon his long unasserted
rights, and by a title so indisputable that it will leave no doubt of the
result.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He is silent and uncommunicative; but he has said enough to show me that
he is possessed of evidence of the compact between Godfrey and himself;
nor is he the man to fail for lack of energy.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have now come to the end of this strange history, in which it is not
impossible you yourselves may be called to play a part, in confirmation of
what you have seen this day.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then this was the same Mr. Barry of whom we spoke last night?&rdquo; said
Nelligan, thoughtfully. &ldquo;When about to describe him to you, I was really
going to say, something like what Mr. Martin might look, if ten years
older and white-haired.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is a strong resemblance still!&rdquo; said Repton, as he busied himself
sealing up the vestry-book and the other documents. &ldquo;These I mean to
deposit in your keeping, Mr. Nelligan, till they be called for. I have
sent over Massingbred to Barry to learn what his wishes may be as to the
next legal steps; and now I am ready to return with you to Oughterard.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Talking over this singular story, they reached the town, where Massingbred
had just arrived a short time before.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have had a long chase,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;and only found him late in the
afternoon at the cottage.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You gave him the packet, then, and asked when we should meet?&rdquo; asked
Repton, hurriedly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; he was walking up and down before the door with the doctor, when we
rode up. He scarcely noticed us; and taking your letter in his hand he
placed it, without breaking the seal, on a seat in the porch. I then gave
him your message, and he seemed so lost in thought that I fancied he had
not attended to me. I was about to repeat it, when he interrupted me,
saying, &lsquo;I have heard you, sir; there is no answer.&rsquo; As I stood for a
moment or two, uncertain what to do or say, I perceived that Joe Nelligan,
who had been speaking to the doctor, had just staggered towards a bench,
ill and fainting. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Barry, turning his eyes towards him, &lsquo;she is
very&mdash;very ill; tell Repton so, and he &lsquo;ll feel for me!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Repton pressed his handkerchief to his face and turned away.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I &lsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Massingbred, &ldquo;that her state is highly dangerous. The
few words the doctor dropped were full of serious meaning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let us hope, and pray,&rdquo; said Repton, fervently, &ldquo;that, amidst all the
calamities of this sorrow-struck land, it may be spared the loss of one
who never opened a cabin door without a blessing, nor closed it but to
shut a hope within.&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER XXXVII. A DARK DAY
</h2>
<p>
A mild, soft day, with low-lying clouds, and rich odors of wild-flowers
rising from the ground, a certain dreamy quiet pervading earth and sky and
sea, over which faint shadows lingered lazily; some drops of the night dew
still glittered on the feathery larches, and bluebells hung down their
heads, heavy with moisture; so still the scene that the plash of the
leaping trout could be heard as he rose in the dark stream. And yet there
was a vast multitude of people there. The whole surface of the lawn that
sloped from the cottage to the river was densely crowded, with every age,
from the oldest to very infancy; with all conditions, from the well-clad
peasant to the humblest &ldquo;tramper&rdquo; of the high-roads. Weariness,
exhaustion, and even hunger were depicted on many of their faces. Some had
passed the night there; others had come long distances, faint and
footsore; but as they sat, stood, or lay in groups around, not a murmur,
not a whisper escaped them; with aching eyes they looked towards an open
window, where the muslin curtain was gently stirred in the faint air.
</p>
<p>
The tidings of Mary Martin&rsquo;s illness had spread rapidly: far-away glens
down the coast, lonely cabins on the bleak mountains, wild remote spots
out of human intercourse had heard the news, and their dwellers had
travelled many a mile to satisfy their aching hearts.
</p>
<p>
From a late hour of the evening before they had learnt nothing of her
state; then a few words whispered by old Catty to those nearest the door
told &ldquo;that she was no better,&mdash;if anything, weaker!&rdquo; These sad
tidings were soon passed from lip to lip; and thus they spent the night,
praying or watching wearily, their steadfast gaze directed towards that
spot where the object of all their fears and hopes lay suffering.
</p>
<p>
Of those there, there was scarcely one to whom she was not endeared by
some personal benefit. She had aided this one in distress, the other she
had nursed in fever; here were the old she had comforted and cheered,
there the children she had taught and trained beside her chair. Her gentle
voice yet vibrated in every heart, her ways of kindness were in every
memory. Sickness and sorrow were familiar enough to themselves. Life was,
at least to most of them, one long struggle; but they could not bring
themselves to think of <i>her</i> thus stricken down! She! that seemed an
angel, as much above the casualties of such fortune as theirs as she was
their superior in station,&mdash;that <i>she</i> should be sick and
suffering was too terrible to think of.
</p>
<p>
There was a stir and movement in the multitude, a wavy, surging motion,
for the doctor was seen to issue from the stable-yard, and lead his pony
towards the bridge. He stopped to say a word or two as he went. They were
sad words; and many a sobbing voice and many a tearful eye told what his
tidings had been. &ldquo;Sinking,&mdash;sinking rapidly!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A faint low cry burst from one in the crowd at this moment, and the rumor
ran that a woman had fainted. It was poor Joan, who had come that night
over the mountain, and, overcome by grief and exhaustion together, had at
last given way.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Get a glass of wine for her, or even a cup of water,&rdquo; cried out three or
four voices; and one nigh the door entered the cottage in search of aid.
The moment after a tall and handsome girl forced her way through the
crowd, and gave directions that Joan might be carried into the house.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why did ye call her my Lady?&rdquo; muttered an old hag to one of the men near
her; &ldquo;sure, she&rsquo;s Henderson&rsquo;s daughter!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is she, faith? By my conscience, then, she might be a better man&rsquo;s! She&rsquo;s
as fine a crayture as ever I seen!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If she has a purty face, she has a proud heart!&rdquo; muttered another.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ayeh! she&rsquo;ll never be like <i>her</i> that&rsquo;s going to leave us!&rdquo; sighed a
young woman with a black ribbon in her cap.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Kate had Joan assisted into the cottage, and was busily occupied
in restoring her. Slowly, and with difficulty, the poor creature came to
herself, and gazing wildly around, asked where she was; then suddenly
bursting out in tears, she said,&mdash;&ldquo;Sure, I know well where I am;
sure, it&rsquo;s my own self, brought grief and sorrow under this roof. But for
<i>me</i> she &lsquo;d be well and hearty this day!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let us still hope,&rdquo; said Kate, softly. &ldquo;Let us hope that one so dear to
us all may be left here. You are better now. I &lsquo;ll join you again
presently.&rdquo; And with noiseless footsteps she stole up the stairs. As she
came to the door, she halted and pressed her hands to her heart, as if in
pain. There was a low murmuring sound, as if of voices, from within, and
Kate turned away and sat down on the stairs.
</p>
<p>
Within the sick-room a subdued light came, and a soft air, mild and balmy,
for the rose-trees and the jessamine clustered over the window, and
mingled their blossoms across it. Mary had just awoke from a short sleep,
and lay with her hand clasped within that of a large and white-haired man
at the bedside.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What a good, kind doctor!&rdquo; said she, faintly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure to find you ever
beside me when I awake.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, darlin&rsquo;, dear,&rdquo; broke in old Catty, &ldquo;sure you ought to know who he
is. Sure it &lsquo;s your own&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hush! be silent!&rdquo; muttered the old man, in a low, stern voice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is it Tuesday to-day?&rdquo; asked Mary, softly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, dear, Tuesday,&rdquo; said the old man.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was on Thursday my poor uncle died. Could I live till Thursday,
doctor?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The old man tried to speak, but could not.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are afraid to shock me,&rdquo; said she, with a faint attempt to smile,
&ldquo;but if you knew how happy I am,&mdash;happy even to leave a life I loved
so well. It never could have been the same again, though&mdash;the spell
was breaking, hardship and hunger were maddening them&mdash;who knows to
what counsels they &lsquo;d have listened soon! Tell Harry to be kind to them,
won&rsquo;t you? Tell him not to trust to others, but to know them himself; to
go, as I have done, amongst them. They &lsquo;ll love him <i>so</i> for doing
it. He is a man, young, rich, and high-hearted,&mdash;how they &lsquo;ll dote
upon him! Catty used to say it was my father they &lsquo;d have worshipped; but
that was in flattery to me, Catty, you always said we were so like&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh dear! oh dear! why won&rsquo;t you tell her?&rdquo; broke in Catty. But a severe
gesture from the old man again checked her words.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How that wild night at sea dwells in my thoughts! I never sleep but to
dream of it. Cousin Harry must not forget those brave fellows. I have
nothing to requite them with. I make no will, doctor,&rdquo; said she, smiling,
&ldquo;for my only legacy is that nosegay there. Will you keep it for my sake?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The old man hid his face, but his strong frame shook and quivered in the
agony of the moment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said she, softly; &ldquo;I hear voices without. Who are they?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the country-people, darlin&rsquo;, come from Kiltimmon and beyond
Kyle-a-Noe, to ax after you. They passed the night there, most of them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Catty, dear, take care that you look after them; they will be hungry and
famished, poor creatures! Oh, how unspeakably grateful to one&rsquo;s heart is
this proof of feeling! Doctor, you will tell Harry how <i>I</i> loved <i>them</i>
and how <i>they</i> loved <i>me</i>. Tell him, too, that this bond of
affection is the safest and best of all ties. Tell him that their old love
for a Martin still survives in their hearts, and it will be his own fault
if he does not transmit it to his children. There&rsquo;s some one sobbing there
without. Oh, bid them be of good heart, Catty; there is none who could go
with less of loss to those behind. There&mdash;there come the great waves
again before me! How my courage must have failed me to make this
impression so deep! And poor Joan, and that dear fond girl who has been as
a sister to me,&mdash;so full of gentleness and love,&mdash;Kate, where is
she? No, do not call her; say that I asked for her&mdash;that I blessed
her&mdash;and sent her this kiss!&rdquo; She pressed a rose to her hot, parched
lips as she spoke, and then closing her eyes seemed to fall off to sleep.
Her breathing, at first strong and frequent, grew fainter and fainter, and
her color came and went, while her lips slightly moved, and a low, soft
murmur came from them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s asleep,&rdquo; muttered Catty, as she crouched down beside the bed.
</p>
<p>
The old man bent over the bed, and watched the calm features. He sat thus
long, for hours, but no change was there; he put his lips to hers, and
then a sickly shuddering came over him, and a low, deep groan, that seemed
to rend his very heart!
</p>
<p>
Three days after, the great gateway of Cro&rsquo; Martin Castle opened to admit
a stately hearse drawn by six horses, all mournfully caparisoned, shaking
with plumes and black-fringed drapery. Two mourning-coaches followed, and
then the massive gates were closed, and the sad pageant wound its slow
course through the demesne. At the same moment another funeral was
approaching the churchyard by a different road. It was a coffin borne by
men bareheaded and sorrow-struck. An immense multitude followed, of every
rank and age; sobs and sighs broke from them as they went. Not an eye was
tearless, not a lip that did not tremble. At the head of this procession
walked a small group whose dress and bearing bespoke their class. These
were Barry Martin, leaning on Repton; Massingbred and the two Nelligans
came behind.
</p>
<p>
The two coffins entered the churchyard at the same instant The uncle and
the niece were laid side by side in the turf! The same sacred words
consigned them both to their last bed; the same second of time heard the
dank reverberation that pronounced &ldquo;earth&rdquo; had returned &ldquo;to earth.&rdquo; A kind
of reverential awe pervaded the immense crowd during the ceremony, and if
here and there a sob would burst from some overburdened heart, all the
rest were silent; respecting, with a deference of true refinement, a
sorrow deeper and greater than their own, they never uttered a word, but
with bent-down heads stole quietly away. And now by each grave the
mourners stood, silently gazing on the little mounds which typify so much
of human sorrow!
</p>
<p>
Barry Martin&rsquo;s bronzed and weather-beaten features were a thought paler,
perhaps. There was a dark shade of color round the eyes, but on the whole
the expression conveyed far more of sternness than sorrow. Such, indeed,
is no uncommon form for grief to take in certain natures. There are men
who regard calamity like a foe, and go out to meet it in a spirit of
haughty defiance. A poor philosophy! He who accepts it as chastisement is
both a braver and a better man!
</p>
<p>
Repton stood for a while beside him, not daring to interrupt his thoughts.
At length he whispered a few words in his ear. Barry started suddenly, and
his dark brow grew sterner and more resolute.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Martin, you must,&rdquo; said Repton, eagerly, &ldquo;I insist upon it. Good
heavens! is it at such a time, in such a place as this, you can harbor a
thought that is not forgiveness? Remember he is poor Godfrey&rsquo;s son, the
last of the race now.&rdquo; As he spoke, passing his arm within the other&rsquo;s, he
drew him gently along, and led him to where a solitary mourner was
standing beside the other grave.
</p>
<p>
Barry Martin stood erect and motionless, while Repton spoke to the young
man. At first the words seemed to confuse and puzzle him, for he looked
vaguely around, and passed his hand across his brow in evident difficulty.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did you say here, in this country? Do I understand you aright?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here, in this very spot; there, standing now before you!&rdquo; said Repton, as
he pushed young Martin towards his uncle.
</p>
<p>
Barry held out his hand, which the young man grasped eagerly; and then, as
if unable to resist his emotions longer, fell, sobbing violently, into the
other&rsquo;s arms.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let us leave them for a while,&rdquo; said Repton, hurrying over to where
Massingbred and the Nelligans were yet standing in silent sorrow.
</p>
<p>
They left the spot together without a word. Grief had its own part for
each. It is not for us to say where sorrow eat deepest, or in which heart
the desolation was most complete.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d not have known young Martin,&rdquo; whispered Nelligan in Repton&rsquo;s ear; &ldquo;he
looks full twelve years older than when last I saw him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The fast men of this age, sir, live their youth rapidly,&rdquo; replied the
other. &ldquo;It is rarely their fortune to survive to be like me, or heaven
knows what hearts they would be left with!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
While they thus talked, Massingbred and Joe Nelligan had strolled away
into the wood. Neither spoke. Massingbred felt the violent trembling of
the other&rsquo;s arm as it rested on his own, and saw a gulping effort by which
more than once he suppressed his rising emotion. For hours they thus
loitered along, and at length, as they issued from the demesne, they found
Repton and Mr. Nelligan awaiting them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Barry Martin has taken his nephew back with him to the cottage,&rdquo; said
Repton, &ldquo;and we &lsquo;ll not intrude upon them for the rest of the evening.&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER XXXVIII. REPTON&rsquo;S LAST CAUSE
</h2>
<p>
We have no right, as little have we the inclination, to inflict our reader
with the details by which Barry Martin asserted and obtained his own. A
suit in which young Martin assumed to be the defendant developed the whole
history to the world, and proclaimed his title to the estate. It was a
memorable case in many ways; it was the last brief Val Repton ever held.
Never was his clear and searching intellect more conspicuous; never did he
display more logical acuteness, nor trace out a difficult narrative with
more easy perspicuity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My Lords,&rdquo; said he, as he drew nigh the conclusion of his speech, &ldquo;it
would have been no ordinary satisfaction to me to close a long life of
labor in these courts by an effort which restores to an ancient name the
noble heritage it had held for centuries. I should have deemed such an
occasion no unfitting close to a career not altogether void of its
successes; but the event has still stronger claims upon my gratitude. It
enables me in all the unembellished sternness of legal proof to display to
an age little credulous of much affection the force of a brother&rsquo;s love,&mdash;the
high-hearted devotion by which a man encountered a long life of poverty
and privation, rather than disturb the peaceful possession of a brother.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Romance has its own way of treating such themes; but I do not believe
romance can add one feature to the simple fact of this man&rsquo;s self-denial.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We should probably be lost in our speculations as to the noble motives of
this sacrifice, if our attention was not called away to something
infinitely finer and more exalted than even this. I mean the glorious life
and martyr&rsquo;s death of her who has made a part of this case less like a
legal investigation than the page of an affecting story. Story, do I say!
Shame on the word! It is in truth and reality alone are such virtues
inscribed. Fiction cannot deal with the humble materials that make up such
an existence,&mdash;the long hours of watching by sickness; the weary care
of teaching the young; the trying disappointments to hope bravely met by
fresh efforts; the cheery encouragement drawn from a heart exhausting
itself to supply others. Think of a young girl&mdash;a very child in the
world&rsquo;s wisdom, more than a man in heroism and daring, with a heart made
for every high ambition, and a station that might command the highest&mdash;calmly
consenting to be the friend of destitution, the companion of misery, the
daily associate of every wretchedness; devoting grace that might have
adorned a court to shed happiness in a cabin, and making of beauty that
would have shed lustre around a palace the sunshine that pierced the gloom
of a peasant&rsquo;s misery! Picture to yourself the hand a prince might have
knelt to kiss, holding the cup to the lips of fever; fancy the form whose
elegance would have fascinated, crouched down beside the embers as she
spoke words of consolation or hope to some bereaved mother or some
desolate orphan!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;These are not the scenes we are wont to look on here. Our cares are,
unhappily, more with the wiles and snares of crafty men than with the
sorrows and sufferings of the good! It is not often human nature wears its
best colors in this place; the spirit of litigious contest little favors
the virtues that are the best adornments of our kind. Thrice happy am I,
then, that I end my day where a glorious sunset gilds its last hours; that
I close my labors not in reprobating crime or stigmatizing baseness, but
with a full heart, thanking God that my last words are an elegy over the
grave of the best of The Martins of Cro&rsquo; Martin.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The inaccurate record from which we take these passages&mdash;for the only
report of the trial is in a newspaper of the time&mdash;adds that the
emotion of the speaker had so far pervaded the court that the conclusion
was drowned in mingled expressions of applause and sorrow; and when Repton
retired, he was followed by the whole bar, eagerly pressing to take their
last farewell of its honored father.
</p>
<p>
The same column of the paper mentions that Mr. Joseph Nelligan was to have
made his first motion that day as Solicitor-General, but had left the
court from a sudden indisposition, and the cause was consequently
deferred.
</p>
<p>
If Val Repton never again took his place in court, he did not entirely
abdicate his functions. Barry Martin had determined on making a conveyance
of the estate to his nephew, and the old lawyer was for several weeks
busily employed in that duty. Although Merl&rsquo;s claim became extinguished
when young Martin&rsquo;s right to the property was annulled, Barry Martin
insisted on arrangements being made to repay him all that he had advanced,&mdash;a
course which Repton, with some little hesitation, at last concurred in. He
urged Barry to reserve a life-interest to himself in the property,
representing the various duties which more properly would fall to his lot
than to that of a young and inexperienced proprietor. But he would not
hear of it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He cannot abide the place,&rdquo; said Repton, when talking the matter over
with Massingbred. &ldquo;He is one of those men who never can forgive the
locality where they have been miserable, nor the individual who has had a
share in their sorrow. When he settles his account with Henderson, then he
‘ll leave the West forever.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And will he still leave Henderson in his charge?&rdquo; asked Jack.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is as it may be,&rdquo; said Repton, cautiously. &ldquo;There is, as I
understand, some very serious reckoning between them. It is the only
subject on which Martin has kept mystery with me, and I do not like even
to advert to it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Massingbred pondered long over these words, without being able to make
anything of them.
</p>
<p>
It might be that Henderson&rsquo;s conduct had involved him in some grave
charge; and if so, Jack&rsquo;s own intentions with regard to the daughter would
be burdened with fresh complications. &ldquo;The steward&rdquo; was bad enough; but if
he turned out to be the &ldquo;unjust steward&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I &lsquo;ll start for Galway
to-night,&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll anticipate the discovery, whatever it be.
She can no longer refuse to see me on the pretext of recent sorrow. It is
now two months and more since this bereavement befell her. I can no longer
combat this life of anxiety and doubt.&mdash;What can I do for you in the
West, sir?&rdquo; asked he of Repton, suddenly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Many things, my young friend,&rdquo; said Repton, &ldquo;if you will delay your
departure two days, since they are matters on which I must instruct you
personally.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Massingbred gave a kind of half-consent, and the other went on to speak of
the necessity for some nice diplomacy between the uncle and his nephew.
&ldquo;They know each other but little; they are on the verge of
misunderstandings a dozen times a day. Benefits are, after all, but sorry
ties between man and man. They may ratify the treaty of affection; they
rarely inscribe the contract!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Still Martin cannot but feel that to the noblest act of his uncle&rsquo;s
generosity he is indebted for all he possesses.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course he knows, and he feels it; but who is to say whether that same
consciousness is not a load too oppressive to bear. I know already Barry
Martin&rsquo;s suggestions as to certain changes have not been well taken, and
he is eager and pressing to leave Ireland, lest anything should disturb
the concord, frail as it is, between them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; exclaimed Massingbred, passionately, &ldquo;there is wonderfully
little real good in this world; wonderfully little that can stand the test
of the very basest of all motives,&mdash;mere gain.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; cried Repton. &ldquo;Men have far better natures than you think;
the fault lies in their tempers. Ay, sir, we are always entering into
heavy recognizances with our passions, to do fifty things we never cared
for. We have said this, we have heard the other; somebody sneered at that,
and some one else agreed with him; and away we go, pitching all reason
behind us, like an old shoe, and only seeking to gratify a whim, or a mere
caprice, suggested by temper. Why do people maintain friendly intercourse
at a distance for years, who could not pass twenty-four hours amicably
under the same roof? Simply because it is their natures, and not their
tempers, are in exercise.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I scarcely can separate the two in my mind,&rdquo; said Jack, doubtingly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you, sir? Why, nature is your skin, temper only your great-coat.&rdquo;
 And the old lawyer laughed heartily at his own conceit. &ldquo;But here comes
the postman.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The double knock had scarcely reverberated through the spacious hall when
the servant entered with a letter.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah! Barry Martin&rsquo;s hand. What have we here?&rdquo; said Repton, as he ran his
eyes over it. &ldquo;So-so; just as I was saying this minute, only that Barry
has the good sense to see it himself. &lsquo;My nephew,&rsquo; he writes, &lsquo;has his own
ideas on all these subjects, which are not mine; and as it is no part of
my plan to hamper my gift with conditions that might impair its value, I
mean to leave this at once.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I have had my full share of calamity since I set foot in this land; and
if this rugged old nature could be crushed by mere misfortune, the last
two months might have done it. But no, Repton, the years by which we
survive friends serve equally to make us survive affections, and we live
on, untouched by time!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I mean to be with you this evening. Let us dine alone together, for I
have much to say to you.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo; Yours ever,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Barry Martin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I hope I may see Massingbred before I sail. I &lsquo;d like to shake hands
with him once again. Say so to him, at all events.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come in to-morrow to breakfast,&rdquo; said Repton; &ldquo;by that time we&rsquo;ll have
finished all mere business affairs.&rdquo; And Massingbred having assented, they
parted.

CHAPTER XXXIX. TOWARDS THE END
</h2>
<p>
Repton was standing at his parlor window, anxiously awaiting his friend&rsquo;s
arrival, when the chaise with four posters came to the door. &ldquo;What have we
here?&rdquo; said the old lawyer to himself, as Barry assisted a lady dressed in
deep mourning to alight, and hurried out to receive them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have not come alone, Repton,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I have brought my
daughter with me.&rdquo; Before Repton could master his amazement at these
words, she had thrown back her veil, revealing the well-known features of
Kate Henderson.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is this possible?&mdash;is this really the case?&rdquo; cried Repton, as he
grasped her hand between both his own. &ldquo;Do I, indeed, see one I have so
long regarded and admired, as the child of my old friend?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Fate, that dealt me so many heavy blows of late, had a kindness in
reserve for me, after all,&rdquo; said Barry. &ldquo;I am not to be quite alone in
this world!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If <i>you</i> be grateful, what ought not to be <i>my</i> thankfulness?&rdquo;
 said Kate, tremulously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Leave us for a moment together, Kate,&rdquo; said Barry; and taking Repton&rsquo;s
arm, he led him into an inner room.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have met with many a sore cut from fortune, Repton,&rdquo; said he, in the
fierce tone that was most natural to him; &ldquo;the nearest and dearest to me
not the last to treat me harshly. I need not tell you how I have been
requited in life; not, indeed, that I seek to acquit myself of my own
share of ill. My whole career has been a fault; it could not bring other
fruit than misery.&rdquo; He paused, and for a while seemed laboring in strong
emotion. At last he went on:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;When that girl was born&mdash;it was two years before I married&mdash;I
intrusted the charge of her to Henderson, who placed her with a sister of
his in Bruges. I made arrangements for her maintenance and education,&mdash;liberally
for one as poor as I was. I made but one condition about her. It was that
under no circumstances save actual want should she ever be reduced to earn
her own bread; but if the sad hour did come, never&mdash;as had been her
poor mothers fate&mdash;never as a governess! It was in that fearful
struggle of condition I first knew her. I continued, year after year, to
hear of her; remitting regularly the sums I promised,&mdash;doubling,
tripling them, when fortune favored me with a chance prosperity. The
letters spoke of her as well and happy, in humble but sufficient
circumstances, equally remote from privation as from the seductions of a
more exalted state. I insisted eagerly on my original condition, and hoped
some day to hear of her being married to some honest but humble man. It
was not often that I had time for self-reproach; but when such seasons
would beset me, I thought of this girl, and her poor mother long dead and
gone&mdash;But let me finish. While I struggled&mdash;and it was often a
hard struggle&mdash;to maintain my side of the compact, selling at ruinous
loss acquisitions it had cost me years of labor to obtain, this fellow,
this Henderson, was basely betraying the trust I placed in him! The girl,
for whose protection, whose safety I was toiling, was thrown by him into
the very world for which I had distinctly excepted her; her talents, her
accomplishments, her very graces, farmed out and hired for his own profit!
Launched into the very sea where her own mother met shipwreck, she was a
mere child, sent to thread her way through the perils of the most
dissipated society. Hear her own account of it, Repton. Let <i>her</i>
tell you what is the tone of that high life to which foreign nobility
imparts its fascinations. Not that I want to make invidious comparisons;
our own country sends its high tributaries to every vice of Europe! I know
not what accident saved her amidst this pollution. Some fancied theory of
popular wrongs, she thinks, gave her a kind of factitious heroism;
elevating her, at least to her own mind, above the frivolous corruptions
around her. She was a democrat, to rescue her from being worse.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;At last came a year of unusual pressure; my remittance was delayed, but
when sent was never acknowledged. From that hour out I never heard of her.
How she came into my brother&rsquo;s family, you yourself know. What was her
life there, she has told me! Not in any spirit of complaint,&mdash;nay,
she acknowledges to many kindnesses and much trust. Even my cold
sister-in-law showed traits for which I had not given her credit. I have
already forgotten her wrongs towards myself, in requital of her conduct to
this poor girl.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll spare you the scene with Henderson, Repton,&rdquo; said he, after a long
pause. &ldquo;When the fellow told me that the girl was the same I had seen
watching by another&rsquo;s sickbed, that she it was whose never-ceasing cares
had soothed the last hours of one dearer than herself, I never gave
another thought to him. I rushed out in search of her, to tell her myself
the tidings.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How did she hear it?&rdquo; asked Repton, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;More calmly than I could tell it. Her first words were, &lsquo;Thank God for
this, for I never could love that man I had called my father!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She knows, then, every circumstance of her birth?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I told her everything. We know each other as well as though we had lived
under the same roof for years. She is my own child in every sentiment and
feeling. She is frank and fearless, Repton,&mdash;two qualities that will
do well enough in the wild savannahs of the New World, but would be
unmanageable gifts in the Old, and thither we are bound. I have written to
Liverpool about a ship, and we shall sail on Saturday.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How warmly do I sympathize in this your good fortune, Martin!&rdquo; said
Repton. &ldquo;She is a noble creature, and worthy of belonging to you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I ask for nothing more, Repton,&rdquo; said he, solemnly. &ldquo;Fortune and station,
such as they exist here, I have no mind for! I&rsquo;m too old now to go to
school about party tactics and politics; I&rsquo;m too stubborn, besides, to
yield up a single conviction for the sake of unity with a party,&mdash;so
much for my unfitness for public life. As to private, I am rough and
untrained; the forms of society so pleasant to others would be penalties
to <i>me</i>. And then,&rdquo; said he, rising, and drawing up his figure to its
full height, &ldquo;I love the forest and the prairie; I glory in the vastness
of a landscape where the earth seems boundless as the sky, and where, if I
hunt down a buffalo-ox, after twenty miles of a chase, I have neither a
game-law nor a gamekeeper nor a charge of trespass hanging over me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some one knocking at the door,&rdquo; said Repton, as he arose and
opened it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A thousand pardons for this interruption,&rdquo; said Mas-singbred, in a low
and eager voice, &ldquo;but I cannot keep my promise to you; I cannot defer my
journey to the West. I start to-night. Don&rsquo;t ask me the reasons. I &lsquo;ll be
free enough to give them if they justify me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But here is one who wishes to shake hands with you, Massingbred,&rdquo; said
Repton, as he led him forward into the room.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope you are going to keep your pledge with me, though,&rdquo; said Barry.
&ldquo;Have you forgotten you have promised to be my guest over the sea?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Jack, sighing, &ldquo;I &lsquo;ve had many a day-dream of late!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The man&rsquo;s in love,&rdquo; said Repton. &ldquo;Nay, prisoner, you are not called on to
say what may criminate you. I &lsquo;ll tell you what, Barry, you &lsquo;ll do the boy
good service by taking him along with you. There &lsquo;s a healthful sincerity
in the active life of the New World well fitted to dispel illusions that
take their rise in the indolent voluptuousness of the Old. Carry him off
then, I say; accept no excuses nor apologies. Send him away to buy powder
and shot, leather gaiters, and the rest of it. When I saw him first
myself, it was in the character of a poacher, and he filled the part well.
Ah! he is gone,&rdquo; added he, perceiving that Martin had just quitted the
room. &ldquo;Poor fellow, he is so full of his present happiness,&mdash;the
first gleam of real sunshine on a long day of lowering gloom! He has just
found a daughter,&mdash;an illegitimate one, but worthy to be the
rightful-born child to the first man in the land. The discovery has
carried him back twenty years of life, and freshened a heart whose wells
of feeling were all but dried up forever. If I mistake not, you must have
met her long ago at Cro&rsquo; Martin.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Possibly. I have no recollection of it,&rdquo; said Jack, musing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;An ignoble confession, sir,&rdquo; said Repton; &ldquo;no less shocked should I be
were she to tell me she was uncertain if she had ever met Mr. Massingbred.
As Burke once remarked to me, &lsquo;Active intelligences, like appropriate
ingredients in chemistry, never meet without fresh combinations.&rsquo; It is
then a shame to ignore such products. I &lsquo;d swear that when you did meet
you understood each other thoroughly; agreed well,&mdash;ay, and what is
more to the purpose, differed in the right places too.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain we did,&rdquo; said Jack, smiling, &ldquo;though I&rsquo;m ungrateful enough to
forget all about it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Martin, entering, &ldquo;I have sent for another advocate to plead
my cause. My daughter will tell you, sir, that she, at least, is not
afraid to encounter the uncivilized glens beside the Orinoco. Come in,
Kate. You tell me that you and Mr. Massingbred are old friends.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Massingbred started as he heard the name, looked up, and there stood Kate
before him, with her hand extended in welcome.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens! what is this? Am I in a dream? Can this be real?&rdquo; cried
Jack, pressing his hands to his temples, and trembling from head to foot
in the intensity of his anxiety.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My father tells me of an invitation he has given you, Mr. Massingbred,&rdquo;
 said she, smiling faintly at his embarrassment, &ldquo;and asks me to repeat it;
but I know far better than he does all that you would surrender by exile
from the great world wherein you are destined to eminence. The great
debater, the witty conversationalist, the smart reviewer, might prove but
a sorry trapper, and even a bad shot! I have my scruples, then, about
supporting a cause where my conscience does not go along with me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My head on&rsquo;t, but he &lsquo;ll like the life well,&rdquo; said Barry, half
impatiently.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Am I to think that you will not ask me to be your guest?&rdquo; said Jack, in a
whisper, only audible by Kate.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have not said so,&rdquo; said she, in the same low tone. &ldquo;Will you go
further, Kate,&rdquo; muttered he, in tremulous eagerness, &ldquo;and say, &lsquo;Come&rsquo;?&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>

<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/410.jpg" width="100%" alt="410 " />
</div>
<p>
&ldquo;I accept!&rdquo; cried Jack, rushing over, and grasping Martin&rsquo;s hands between
his own. &ldquo;I &lsquo;m ready,&mdash;this hour, this instant, if you like it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We find the prisoner guilty, my Lords,&rdquo; said Repton; &ldquo;but we recommend
him to mercy, as his manner on this occasion convinces us it is a first
offence.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We have now done with the Martins of Cro&rsquo; Martin. Should any of our
readers feel a curiosity as to the future fortunes of the estate, its
story, like that of many another Irish property, is written in the
Encumbered Estates Court. Captain Martin only grew wiser by the especial
experience of one class of difficulties. His indolent, easy disposition
and a taste for expense led him once again into embarrassments from which
there was but one issue,&mdash;the sale of his property. He has still,
however, a handsome subsistence remaining, and lives with Lady Dorothea,
notable and somewhat distinguished residents of a city on the Continent.
</p>
<p>
We cannot persuade ourselves that we have inspired interest for the
humbler characters of our piece. Nor dare we ask the reader to hear more
about Mrs. Cronan and her set, nor learn how Kilkieran fared in the
changes around it.
</p>
<p>
For Joseph Nelligan, however, we claim a parting word. He was the first of
an order of men who have contributed no small share to the great social
revolution of Ireland in late years. With talents fully equal to the best
in the opposite scale of party, and a character above all reproach, he
stood a rebuking witness to all the taunts and sarcasms once
indiscriminately levelled at his class; and, at the same time, inspired
his own party with the happy knowledge that there was a nobler and more
legitimate road to eminence than by factious display and popular
declamation.
</p>
<p>
We do not wish to inquire how far the one great blow to his happiness&mdash;the
disappointment of his early life&mdash;contributed to his success by
concentrating his ambition on his career. Certain is it, no man achieved a
higher or more rapid elevation, and old Dan lived to receive at his board
the Chief Justice of the Queen&rsquo;s Bench in the person of his own son.
</p>
<p>
Poor Simmy Crow! for if we would forget him, he has taken care that
oblivion is not to be his fate. He has sent from the Rocky Mountains,
where he is now wandering with Barry Martin, some sketches of Indian Life
to the Irish Art Exhibition.
</p>
<p>
If it be a pleasure to trace in our friends the traits we have admired in
them in youth, and remark the embers of the fires that once wanned their
hearts, Simmy affords us this gratification, since his drawings reveal the
inspirations that first filled his early mind. The Chief in his war-paint
has a fac-simile likeness to his St. John in the Wilderness; and as for
the infant the squaw is bathing in the stream, we can produce twelve
respectable witnesses to depose that it is &ldquo;Moses.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We are much tempted to add a word about the Exiles themselves, but we
abstain. It is enough to say that all the attractive prospects of ambition
held out by friends, all the seductions of generous offers from family,
have never tempted them to return to the Old World; but that they live on
happily, far away from the jarring collisions of life, the tranquil
existence they had longed for.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
