    <h2>
      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I wrote this story in the Tyrol. The accident of my residence there was in
      this wise: I had travelled about the Continent for a considerable time in
      company with my family with my own horses. Our carriage was a large and
      comfortable calèche, and our team, four horses; the leaders of which,
      well-bred and thriving-looking, served as saddle horses when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something very gypsy-like in this roving, uncertain existence,
      that had no positive bent or limit, and left every choice of place an open
      question, that gave me intense enjoyment. It opened to me views of
      Continental life, scenery, people and habits I should certainly never have
      attained to by other modes of travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only were our journeys necessarily short each day, but we frequently
      sojourned in little villages, and out-of-the-world spots, where, if
      pleased by the place itself, and the accommodation afforded, we would
      linger on for days, having at our disposal the total liberty of our time,
      and all our nearest belongings around us.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of these rambles we had arrived at the town of Bregenz, on
      the Lake of Constance; where the innkeeper, to whom I was known, accosted
      me with all the easy freedom of his calling, and half-jestingly alluded to
      my mode of travelling as a most unsatisfactory and wasteful way of life,
      which could never turn out profitably to myself or to mine. From the
      window where we were standing as we talked, I could descry the tall summit
      of an ancient castle, or schloss, about two miles away; and rather to
      divert my antagonist from his argument than with any more serious purpose,
      I laughingly told my host, if he could secure me such a fine old chateau
      as that I then looked at, I should stable my nags and rest where I was. On
      the following day, thinking of nothing less than my late conversation, the
      host entered my room to assure me that he had been over to the castle, had
      seen the baron, and learned that he would have no objection to lease me
      his chateau, provided I took it for a fixed term, and with all its
      accessories, not only of furniture but cows and farm requisites. One of my
      horses, accidentally pricked in shoeing, had obliged me at the moment to
      delay a day or two at the inn, and for want of better to do, though
      without the most remote intention of becoming a tenant of the castle, I
      yielded so far to my host&rsquo;s solicitation,&mdash; to walk over and see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the building itself was far from faultless it was spacious and
      convenient, and its position on a low hill in the middle of a lawn finer
      than anything I can convey; the four sides of the schloss commanding four
      distinct and perfectly dissimilar views. By the north it looked over a
      wooded plain, on which stood the Convent of Mehreran; and beyond this, the
      broad expanse of the Lake of Constance. The south opened a view towards
      the Upper Rhine, and the valley that led to the Via Mala. On the east you
      saw the Gebhardsberg and its chapel, and the lovely orchards that bordered
      Bregenz; while to the west rose the magnificent Lenten and the range of
      the Swiss Alps,&mdash;their summits lost in the clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was so enchanted by the glorious panorama around me, and so carried away
      by the thought of a life of quiet labor and rest in such a spot, that
      after hearing a very specious account of the varied economies I should
      secure by this choice of a residence, and the resources I should have in
      excursions on all sides, that I actually contracted to take the chateau,
      and became master of the Rieden Schloss from that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus explained by what chance I came to pitch my home in this
      little-visited spot, I have no mind to dwell further on my Tyrol
      experiences than as they concern the story which I wrote there.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the scene in which I was living, the dress of the peasants, the daily
      ways and interests had been my prompters, I could not have addressed
      myself to an Irish theme; but long before I had come to settle at
      Predeislarg, when wandering amongst the Rhine villages, on the vine-clad
      slopes of the Bergstrasse, I had been turning over in my mind the Union
      period of Ireland as the era for a story. It was a time essentially rich
      in the men we are proud of as a people, and peculiarly abounding in traits
      of self-denial and devotion which, in the corruption of a few, have been
      totally lost sight of; the very patriotism of the time having been
      stigmatized as factious opposition, or unreasoning resistance to wiser
      counsels. That nearly every man of ability in the land was against the
      Minister, that not only all the intellect of Ireland, but all the high
      spirit of its squirearchy, and the generous impulses of its people, were
      opposed to the Union,&mdash;there is no denying. If eloquent appeal and
      powerful argument could have saved a nation, Henry Grattan or Plunkett
      would not have spoken in vain; but the measure was decreed before it was
      debated, and the annexation of Ireland was made a Cabinet decision before
      it came to Irishmen to discuss it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no presumption to imagine I could throw any new light on the history
      of the period, or illustrate the story of the measure by any novel
      details; but I thought it would not be uninteresting to sketch the era
      itself; what aspect society presented; how the country gentleman of the
      time bore himself in the midst of solicitations and temptings the most
      urgent and insidious; what, in fact, was the character of that man whom no
      national misfortunes could subdue, no Ministerial blandishments corrupt;
      of him, in short, that an authority with little bias to the land of his
      birth has called,&mdash;<i>The First Gentleman of Europe</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know well, I feel too acutely, how inadequately I have pictured what I
      desired to paint; but even now, after the interval of years, I look back
      on my poor attempt with the satisfaction of one whose aim was not ignoble.
      A longer and deeper experience of life has succeeded to the time since I
      wrote this story, but in no land nor amongst any people have I ever found
      the type of what we love to emblematize by the word Gentleman, so
      distinctly marked out as in the educated and travelled Irishman of that
      period. The same unswerving fidelity of friendship, the same courageous
      devotion to a cause, the same haughty contempt for all that was mean or
      unworthy; these, with the lighter accessories of genial temperament,
      joyous disposition, and a chivalrous respect for women, made up what I had
      at least in my mind when I tried to present to my readers my Knight of
      Gwynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      That my character of him was not altogether ideal, I can give no better
      proof than the fact that during the course of the publication I received
      several letters from persons unknown to me, asking whether I had not drawn
      my portrait from this or that original, several concurring in the belief
      that I had taken as my model The Knight of Kerry, whose qualities, I am
      well assured, fully warranted the suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my attempt to paint the social habits of the period, I had but to draw
      on my memory. In my boyish days I had heard much of that day, and was
      familiar with most of the names of its distinguished men. Anecdotes of
      Henry Grattan, Flood, Parsons, Ponsonby, and Curran jostled in my mind
      with stories of their immediate successors, the Bushes and the Plunketts,
      whose fame has come down to the very day we live in. As a boy, it was my
      fortune to listen to the narratives of the men who had been actors in the
      events of that exciting era, and who could even show me in modern Dublin
      the scenes where memorable events occurred, and not unfrequently the very
      houses where celebrated convivialities occurred. And thus from Drogheda
      Street, the modern Sackville Street, where the beaux of the day lounged in
      all their bravery, to the Circular road, where a long file of carriages,
      six in hand, evidenced the luxury and tone of display of the capital. I
      was deeply imbued with the features of the time, and ransacked the old
      newspapers and magazines with a zest which only great familiarity with the
      names of the leading characters could have inspired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though I have many regrets on the same score, there is no period of my
      life in which I have the same sorrow for not having kept some sort of
      note-book, instead of trusting to a memory most fatally unretentive and
      uncertain. Through this omission I have lost traces of innumerable
      epigrams, and <i>jeux d&rsquo;esprit</i> of a time that abounded in such
      effusions, and even where my memory has occasionally relieved the effort,
      I have forgotten the author. To give an instance, the witty lines,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;With a name that is borrowed, a title that &lsquo;s bought,
     Sir William would fain be a gentleman thought;
     His wit is but cunning, his courage but vapor,
     His pride is but money, his money but paper:&rdquo;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      which, wrongfully attributed to a political leader in the Irish house,
      were in reality written by Lovel Edgeworth on the well-known Sir William
      Gladowes, who became Lord Newcomen; and the verse was not only poetry but
      prophecy, for in his bankruptcy some years afterwards the sarcasm became
      fact,&mdash;&ldquo;his money was but paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This circumstance of the authorship was communicated to me by Miss Maria
      Edgeworth, whose letter was my first step in acquaintance with her, and
      gave me a pleasure and a pride which long years have not been able to
      obliterate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember in that letter her having told me how she was in the habit of
      reading my story aloud to the audience of her nephews and nieces; a simple
      announcement that imparted such a glow of proud delight to me, that I can
      yet recall the courage with which I resumed the writing of my tale, and
      the hope it suggested of my being able one day to win a place of honor
      amongst those who, like herself, had selected Irish traits as the
      characteristics to adorn fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Con Heffernan I had an original. For Bagenal Daly, too, I was not
      without a model. His sister is purely imaginary, but that she is not
      unreal I am bold enough to hope, since several have assured me that they
      know where I found my type. In my brief sketch of Lord Castlereagh I was
      not, I need scarcely say, much aided by the journals and pamphlets of the
      time, where his character and conduct were ruthlessly and most falsely
      assailed. It was my fortune, however, to have possessed the close intimacy
      of one who had acted as his private secretary, and whose abilities have
      since raised him to high station and great employment; and from him I came
      to know the real nature of one of the ablest statesmen of his age, as he
      was one of the most attractive companions, and most accomplished
      gentlemen. I have no vain pretence to believe that by my weak and
      unfinished sketch I have in any way vindicated the Minister who carried
      the Union against the attacks of his opponents, but I have tried at least
      to represent him such as he was in the society of his intimates; his gay
      and cheerful temperament, his frank nature, and what least the world is
      disposed to concede to him, his sincere belief in the honesty of men whose
      convictions were adverse to him, and who could not be won over to his
      opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not tried to conceal the gross corruption of an era which remains
      to us as a national shame, but I would wish to lay stress on the fact that
      not a few resisted offers and temptations, which to men struggling with
      humble fortune, and linked for life with the fate of the weaker country,
      must redound to their high credit. All the nobler their conduct, as around
      them on every side were the great names of the land trafficking for title
      and place, and shamelessly demanding office for their friends and
      relatives as the price of their own adhesion.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that degree of intimacy which I have represented as existing between
      Bagenal Daly and Freney the robber, I have been once or twice reprehended
      as conveying a false and unreal view of the relations of the time; but the
      knowledge I myself had of Freney, his habits and his exploits, were given
      to me by a well-known and highly-connected Irish gentleman, who
      represented a county in the Irish Parliament, and was a man of unblemished
      honor, conspicuous alike in station and ability. And there is still, and
      once the trait existed more remarkably in Ireland, a wonderful sympathy
      between all classes and conditions of people: so that the old stories and
      traditions that amuse the crouching listener round the hearth of the
      cottage, find their way into luxurious drawing-rooms; and by their means a
      brotherhood of sentiment was maintained between the highest class in the
      land and the humblest peasant who labored for his daily bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to display the effect of this strange teaching on the mind of a
      cultivated gentleman when describing the Knight of Gwynne. I endeavored to
      show the &ldquo;Irishry&rdquo; of his nature was no other than the play of those
      qualities by which he appreciated his countrymen and was appreciated by
      them. So powerful is this sympathy, and so strong the sense of national
      humor through all classes of the people, that each is able to entertain a
      topic from the same point of view as his neighbor, and the subtle <i>équivoque</i>
      in the polished witticism that amuses the gentleman is never lost on the
      untutored ear of the unlettered peasant. Is there any other land of which
      one can say as much?
    </p>
    <p>
      If this great feature of attractiveness pertains to the country and adds
      to its adaptiveness as the subject of fiction, I cannot but feel that to
      un-Irish ears it is necessary to make an explanation which will serve to
      show that which would elsewhere imply a certain blending of station and
      condition, is here but a proof of that widespread understanding by which,
      however divided by race, tradition, and religion, we are always able to
      appeal to certain sympathies and dispositions in common, and feel the tie
      of a common country.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the period in which I have placed this story the rivalry between the
      two nations was, with all its violence, by no means ungenerous. No
      contemptuous estimate of Irishmen formed the theme of English journalism;
      and between the educated men of both countries there was scarcely a
      jealousy that the character which political contest assumed later on,
      changed much of this spirit and dyed nationalities with an amount of
      virulence which, with all its faults and all its shortcomings, we do not
      find in the times of the Knight of Gwynne.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. A FIRESIDE GROUP
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was exactly forty-five years ago that a group, consisting of three
      persons, drew their chairs around the fire of a handsome dinner-room in
      Merrion Square, Dublin. The brilliantly lighted apartment, the table still
      cumbered with decanters and dessert, and the sideboard resplendent with a
      gorgeous service of plate, showed that the preparations had been made for
      a much larger party, the last of whom had just taken his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the three who now drew near the cheerful blaze, more intent, as it
      seemed, on confidential intercourse than the pleasures of the table, he
      who occupied the centre was a tall and singularly handsome man, of some
      six or seven-and-twenty years of age. His features, perfectly classical in
      their regularity, conveyed the impression of one of a cold and haughty
      temperament, unmoved by sudden impulse, but animated by a spirit daringly
      ambitious. His dress was in the height of the then mode, and he wore it
      with the air of a man of fashion and elegance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Lord Castlereagh, the youthful Secretary for Ireland, one whose
      career was then opening with every promise of future distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his right hand sat, or rather lounged, in all the carelessness of
      habitual indolence, a young man some years his junior, his dark complexion
      and eyes, his aquiline features, and short, thin upper lip almost
      resembling a Spanish face.
    </p>
    <p>
      His dress was the uniform of the Foot Guards,&mdash;a costume which well
      became him, and set off to the fullest advantage a figure of perfect
      symmetry. A manner of careless inattention in which he indulged,
      contrasted strongly with the quick impatience of his dark glances and the
      eager rapidity of his utterance when momentarily excited; for the
      Honorable Dick Forester was only cool by training, and not by temperament,
      and, at the time we speak of, his worldly education was scarcely more than
      well begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third figure&mdash;strikingly unlike the other two&mdash;was a man of
      fifty or thereabouts, short and plethoric. His features, rosy and sensual,
      were lit up by two gray eyes whose twinkle was an incessant provocative to
      laughter. The mouth was, however, the great index to his character. It was
      large and full, the under lip slightly projecting,&mdash;a circumstance
      perhaps acquired in the long habit of a life where the tasting function
      had been actively employed; for Con Heffernan was a gourmand of the first
      water, and the most critical judge of a vintage the island could boast.
      Two fingers of either hand were inserted in the capacious pockets of a
      white vest, while, his head jauntily leaning to one side, he sat the very
      ideal of self-satisfied ease and contentment. The <i>aplomb</i>&mdash;why
      should there be a French word for an English quality?&mdash;he possessed
      was not the vulgar ease of a presuming or underbred man,&mdash;far from
      it; it was the impress of certain gifts which gave him an acknowledged
      superiority in the society he moved in. He was shrewd, without
      over-caution; he was ready-witted, but never rash; he possessed that rare
      combination of quick intelligence with strong powers of judgment; and,
      above all, he knew men, or at least such specimens of the race as came
      before him in a varied life, well and thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had a weak point in his character, it was a love of popularity,&mdash;not
      that vulgar mob-worship which some men court and seek after; no, it was
      the estimation of his own class and set he desired to obtain. He was proud
      of his social position, and nervously sensitive in whatever might
      prejudice or endanger it. His enemies&mdash;and Con was too able a man not
      to have made some&mdash;said that his low origin was the secret of his
      nature; that his ambiguous position in society demanded exertions uncalled
      for from others less equivocally circumstanced; and that Mr. Heffernan
      was, in secret, very far from esteeming the high and titled associates
      with whom his daily life brought him in contact. If this were the case, he
      was assuredly a consummate actor. No man ever went through a longer or
      more searching trial unscathed, nor could an expression be quoted, or an
      act mentioned, in which he derogated, even for a moment, from the habits
      of &ldquo;his order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never did the thing better in your life, my Lord,&rdquo; said Con, as the
      door closed upon the last departing guest. &ldquo;You hit off Jack Massy to
      perfection; and as for Watson, though he said nothing at the time, I &lsquo;ll
      wager my roan cob against Deane Moore&rsquo;s hackney&mdash;long odds, I fancy&mdash;that
      you find him at the Treasury to-morrow morning, with a sly request for
      five minutes&rsquo; private conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m of your mind, Heffernan. I saw that he took the bait,&mdash;indeed,
      to do the gentlemen justice, they are all open to conviction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surely cannot blame them,&rdquo; said Con, &ldquo;if they take a more
      conciliating view of your Lordship&rsquo;s opinions when assisted by such claret
      as this: this is old &lsquo;72, if I mistake not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They sold it to me as such; but I own to you I &lsquo;m the poorest connoisseur
      in the world as regards wine. Some one remarked this evening that the &lsquo;95
      was richer in bouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Edward Harvey, my Lord. I heard him; but that was the year he got
      his baronetcy, and he thinks the sun never shone so brightly before; his
      father was selling Balbriggan stockings when this grape was ripening, and
      now, the son has more than one foot on the steps of the peerage.&rdquo; This was
      said with a short, quick glance beneath the eyelids, and evidently more as
      a feeler than with any strong conviction of its accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No Government can afford to neglect its supporters, and the
      acknowledgments must be proportioned to the sacrifices, as well as to the
      abilities of the individuals who second it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! if these gentlemen are in the market,&rdquo; said Forester, who broke
      silence for the first time, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at their price being a high
      one; in consenting to the &lsquo;Union,&rsquo; they are virtually voting their own
      annihilation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; said the Secretary, calmly; &ldquo;the field open to their
      ambition is imperial, and not provincial; the English Parliament will form
      an arena for the display of ability as wide surely as this of Dublin. Men
      of note and capacity will not be less rewarded: the losers will be the
      small talkers, county squires of noisy politics, and crafty lawyers of no
      principles; they will, perhaps, be obliged to remain at home and look
      after their own affairs; but will the country be the worse for that, while
      the advantages to trade and commerce are inconceivable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you there,&rdquo; said Con; &ldquo;we are likely to increase our
      exports, by sending every clever fellow out of the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, if the market be a better one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would n&rsquo;t you spare us a few luxuries for home consumption?&rdquo; said Con, as
      he smacked his lips and looked at his glass through the candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Lordship paid no attention to the remark, but, taking a small tablet
      from his waistcoat-pocket, seemed to study its contents. &ldquo;Are we certain
      of Cuffe; is he pledged to us, Heffernan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my Lord, he has no help for it; we are sure of him; he owes the
      Crown eleven thousand pounds, and says the only ambition he possesses is
      to make the debt twelve, and never pay it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of that canting fellow from the North,&mdash;New-land?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He accepts your terms conditionally, my Lord,&rdquo; said Con, with a sly roll
      of his eye. &ldquo;If the arguments are equal to your liberality, he will vote
      for you; but as yet he does not <i>see</i> the advantages of a Union.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not <i>see</i> them!&rdquo; said Lord Castlereagh, with a look of irony; &ldquo;why
      did you not let him look at them from your own windows, Heffernan? The
      view is enchanting for the Barrack Department.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor man is short-sighted,&rdquo; said Con, with a sigh, &ldquo;and never could
      stretch his vision beyond the Custom House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so, in the devil&rsquo;s name; a commissioner more or less shall never,
      stop us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a set of rascals,&rdquo; muttered Forester between his teeth, as he tossed
      off a bumper to swallow his indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Forester, what of your mission? Have you heard from your friend
      Darcy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I have his note here. He cannot come over just now, but he has given
      me an introduction to his father, and pledges himself I shall be well
      received.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Darcy is that?&rdquo; said Heffernan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Knight of Gwynne,&rdquo; said his Lordship; &ldquo;do you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, my Lord, there is not a gentleman in Ireland who could not say
      yes to that question; while west of the Shannon, Maurice Darcy is a name
      to swear by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want such a man much,&rdquo; said the Secretary, in a low, distinct
      utterance; &ldquo;some well-known leader of public opinion is of great value
      just now. How does he vote usually? I don&rsquo;t see his name in the
      divisions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he rarely comes up to town, never liked Parliament; but when he did
      attend the House, he usually sat with the Opposition, but, without linking
      himself to party, spoke and voted independently, and, strange to say, made
      considerable impression by conduct which in any other man would have
      proved an utter failure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he speak well, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the first five minutes you could think of nothing but his look and
      appearance; he was the handsomest man in the House, a little too
      particular, perhaps, in dress, but never finical; as he went on, however,
      the easy fluency of his language, the grace and elegance of his style, and
      the frank openness of his statements, carried his hearers with him; and
      many who were guarded enough against the practised power of the great
      speakers were entrapped by the unstudied, manly tone of the Knight of
      Gwynne. You say truly, he would be a great card in your hands at this
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must have him at his own price, if he has one. Is he rich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has an immense estate, but, as I hear, greatly encumbered; but don&rsquo;t
      think of money with him, that will never do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the bait, then? Does he care for rank? Has he any children grown
      up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One son and one daughter are all his family; and as for title, I don&rsquo;t
      think that he &lsquo;d exchange that of Knight of Gwynne for a Dukedom. His son
      is a lieutenant in the Guards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and the best fellow in the regiment,&rdquo; broke in Forester. &ldquo;In every
      quality of a high-spirited gentleman, Lionel Darcy has no superior.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The better deserving of rapid promotion,&rdquo; said his Lordship, smiling
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be sorry to offer it to him at the expense of his father&rsquo;s
      principles,&rdquo; said Forester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very little fear of your having to do so,&rdquo; said Heffernan, quickly; &ldquo;the
      Knight would be no easy purchase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must see him, however, Dick.&rdquo; said the Secretary; &ldquo;there is no reason
      why he should not be with us on grounds of conviction. He is a man of
      enlightened and liberal mind, and surely will not think the worse of a
      measure because its advocates are in a position to serve his son&rsquo;s
      interests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that topic be kept very studiously out of sight, it were all the more
      prudent,&rdquo; said Con, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; Forester will pay his visit, and only advert to the matter
      with caution and delicacy. To gain him to our side is a circumstance of so
      much moment that I say <i>carte blanche</i> for the terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew the time that a foxhound would have been a higher bribe than a
      blue ribbon with honest Maurice; but it&rsquo;s many years since we met, now,
      and Heaven knows what changes time may have wrought in him. A smile and a
      soft speech from a pretty woman, or a bold exploit of some hare-brained
      fellow, were sure to find favor with him, when he would have heard
      flattery from the lips of royalty without pride or emotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His colleague in the county is with us; has he any influence over the
      Knight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far from it. Mr. Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly is the last man in the world to have
      weight with Maurice Darcy, and if it be your intention to make O&rsquo;Reilly a
      peer, you could have taken no readier method to arm the Knight against
      you. No, no; if you really are bent on having him, leave all thought of a
      purchase aside; let Forester, as the friend and brother officer of young
      Darcy, go down to Gwynne, make himself as agreeable to the Knight as may
      be, and when he has one foot on the carriage-step at his departure, turn
      sharply round, and say, &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you vote with us, Knight?&rsquo; What between
      surprise and courtesy, he may be taken too short for reflection, and if he
      say but &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; ever so low, he&rsquo;s yours. That&rsquo;s <i>my</i> advice to you. It
      may seem a poor chance, but I fairly own I see no better one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought rank might be acceptable in such a quarter,&rdquo; said
      the Secretary, proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has it, my Lord,&mdash;at least as much as would win all the respect
      any rank could confer; and besides, these new peerages have no prestige in
      their favor yet a while; we must wait for another generation. This claret
      is perfect now, but I should not say it were quite so delicate in flavor
      the first year it was bottled. The squibs and epigrams on the new
      promotions are remembered where the blazons of the Heralds&rsquo; College are
      forgotten; that unlucky banker, for instance, that you made a Viscount the
      other day, both his character and his credit have suffered for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that you allude to?&mdash;an epigram, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very short, but scarcely sweet. Here it is:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;&lsquo;With a name that is borrowed, a title that&rsquo;s bought,&mdash;&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      you, remember, my Lord, how true both allegations are,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;With a name that is borrow&rsquo;d, a title that&rsquo;s bought, Sir William would
      fain be a gentleman thought; While his Wit is mere cunning, his Courage
      but vapor, His Pride is but money, his Money but paper.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very severe, certainly,&rdquo; said his Lordship, in the same calm tone he ever
      spoke. &ldquo;Not your lines, Mr. Heffernan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my Lord; a greater than Con Heffernan indited these,&mdash;one who
      did not scruple to reply to yourself in the House in an imitation of your
      own inimitable manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know whom you mean,&mdash;a very witty person indeed,&rdquo; said the
      Secretary, smiling; &ldquo;and if we were to be laughed out of office, he might
      lead the Opposition. But these are very business-like, matter-of-fact days
      we &lsquo;re fallen upon. The cabinet that can give away blue ribbons may afford
      to be indifferent to small jokers. But to revert to matters more
      immediate: you must start at once, Forester, for the West, see the Knight,
      and do whatever you can to bring him towards us. I say <i>carte blanche</i>
      for the terms; I only wish our other elevations to the peerage had half
      the pretension he has; and, whatever our friend Mr. Heffernan may say, I
      opine to the mere matter of compact, which says, so much for so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s success to the mission, however its negotiations incline,&rdquo; said
      Heffernan, as he drained off his glass and rose to depart. &ldquo;We shall see
      you again within ten days or a fortnight, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly; I&rsquo;ll not linger in that wild district an hour longer than
      I must.&rdquo; And so, with good night and good wishes, the party separated,&mdash;Forester
      to make his preparations for a journey which, in those days, was looked on
      as something formidable.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. A TRAVELLING ACQUAINTANCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whatever the merits or demerits of the great question, the legislative
      union between England and Ireland,&mdash;and assuredly we have neither the
      temptation of duty nor inclination to discuss such here,&mdash;the means
      employed by Ministers to carry the measure through Parliament were in the
      last degree disgraceful. Never was bribery practised with more open
      effrontery, never did corruption display itself with more daring
      indifference to public opinion; the Treasury office was an open mart,
      where votes were purchased, and men sold their country, delighted, as a
      candid member of the party confessed,&mdash;delighted &ldquo;to have a country
      to sell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ardor of a political career, like the passion for the chase, would
      seem in its high excitement to still many compunctious murmurings of
      conscience which in calmer moments could not fail to be heard and
      acknowledged: the desire to succeed, that ever-present impulse to win,
      steels the heart against impressions which, under less pressing
      excitements, had been most painful to endure; and, in this way, honorable
      and high-minded men have often stooped to acts which, with calmer judgment
      to guide them, they would have rejected with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was Dick Forester&rsquo;s position at the moment. An aide-de-camp on the
      staff of the Viceroy, a near relative of the Secretary, he was intrusted
      with many secret and delicate negotiations, affairs in which, had he been
      a third party, he would have as scrupulously condemned the tempter as the
      tempted; the active zeal of agency allayed, however, all such qualms of
      conscience, and every momentary pang of remorse was swallowed up in the
      ardor for success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few men will deny in the abstract the cruelty of many field-sports they
      persist in following; fewer still abandon them on such scruples; and while
      Forester felt half ashamed to himself of the functions committed to him,
      he would have been sorely disappointed if he had been passed over in the
      selection of his relative&rsquo;s political adherents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this nature were some of Dick Forester&rsquo;s reflections as he posted along
      towards the West; nor was the scene through which he journeyed suggestive
      of pleasanter thoughts. If any of our readers should perchance be
      acquainted with that dreary line of country which lies along the great
      western road of Ireland, they will not feel surprised if the traveller&rsquo;s
      impressions of the land were not of the brightest or fairest. The least
      reflective of mortals cannot pass through a dreary and poverty-stricken
      district without imbibing some of the melancholy which broods over the
      place. Forester was by no means such, and felt deeply and sincerely for
      the misery he witnessed on every hand, and was in the very crisis of some
      most patriotic scheme of benevolence, when his carriage arrived in front
      of the little inn of Kilbeggan. Resisting, without much violence to his
      inclinations, the civil request of the landlord to alight, he leaned back
      to resume the broken thread of his lucubrations, while fresh horses were
      put to. How long he thus waited, or what progress his benign devices
      accomplished in the mean while, this true history is unable to record;
      enough if we say that when he next became aware of the incidents then
      actually happening around him, he discovered that his carriage was
      standing fast in the same place as at the moment of his arrival, and the
      rain falling in torrents, as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      To let down the glass and call out to the postilions was a very natural
      act; to do so with the addition of certain expletives not commonly used in
      good society, was not an extraordinary one. Forester did both; but he
      might have spared his eloquence and his indignation, for the postilions
      were both in the stable, and his servant agreeably occupied in the bar
      over the comforts of a smoking tumbler of punch. The merciful schemes so
      late the uppermost object of his thoughts were routed in a moment, and,
      vowing intentions of a very different purport to the whole household, he
      opened the door and sprang out. Dark as the night was, he could see that
      there were no horses to the carriage, and, with redoubled anger at the
      delay, he strode into the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holloa, I say&mdash;house here! Linwood! Where the devil is the fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, sir,&rdquo; cried a smart-looking London servant, as he sprang from the
      bar with his eyes bolting out of his head from the heat of the last
      mouthful, swallowed in a second. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a trying for horses, sir; but
      they&rsquo;ve never got &lsquo;em, though they &lsquo;ve been promising to let us have a
      pair this half-hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No horses! Do you mean that they&rsquo;ve not got a pair of posters in a town
      like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, sir,&rdquo; interposed a dirty waiter in a nankeen jacket; for the
      landlord was too indignant at the rejection of his proposal to appear
      again, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve four pair, besides a mare in foal; but there&rsquo;s a deal of
      business on the line this week past, and there&rsquo;s a gentleman in the parlor
      now has taken four of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taken four! Has he more than one carriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, a light chariot it is; but he likes to go fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so do I&mdash;when I can,&rdquo; muttered Forester, the last words being an
      addition almost independent of him. &ldquo;Could n&rsquo;t you tell him that there&rsquo;s a
      gentleman here very much pressed to push on, and would take it as a great
      favor if he&rsquo;d divide the team?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, sir, I&rsquo;ll go and speak to him,&rdquo; said the waiter, as he
      hurried away on the errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see how it is, sir,&rdquo; said Linwood, who, with true servant dexterity,
      thought to turn his master&rsquo;s anger into any other channel than towards
      himself, &ldquo;they wants to get you to stop the night here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound this trickery! I&rsquo;ll pay what they please for the horses, only
      let us have them.&mdash;Well, waiter, what does he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says, sir,&rdquo; said the waiter, endeavoring to suppress a laugh, &ldquo;if you
      &lsquo;ll come in and join him at supper, you shall have whatever you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Join him at supper! No, no; I&rsquo;m hurried, I&rsquo;m anxious to get forward, and
      not the least hungry besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better speak a word to him, anyhow?&rdquo; said the waiter, half
      opening the parlor door. And Forester, accepting the suggestion, entered.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      In the little low-ceilinged apartment of the small inn, at a table very
      amply and as temptingly covered, sat a large and, for his age, singularly
      handsome man. A forehead both high and broad surmounted two clear blue
      eyes, whose brilliancy seemed to defy the wear of time; regular and
      handsome teeth; and a complexion the very type of health appeared to vouch
      for a strength of constitution rare at his advanced age. His dress was the
      green coat so commonly worn by country gentlemen, with leather breeches
      and boots, nor, though the season was winter, did he appear to have any
      great-coat, or other defence against the weather. He was heaping some turf
      upon the fire as Forester entered, and, laughingly interrupting the
      operation, he stood up and bowed courteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have taken a great liberty, sir, first, to suppose that any man at this
      hour of the night is not the worse for something to eat and drink; and,
      secondly, that he might have no objection to partake of either in my
      company.&rdquo; Forester was not exactly prepared for a manner so palpably that
      of the best society, and, at once repressing every sign of his former
      impatience, replied by apologizing for a request which might inconvenience
      the granter. &ldquo;Let me help you to this grouse-pie, and fill yourself a
      glass of sherry; and by the time you have taken some refreshment, the
      horses will be put to. I am most happy to offer you a seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid there is a mistake somewhere,&rdquo; said Forester, half timidly.
      &ldquo;I heard you had engaged the only four horses here, and as my carriage is
      without, my request was to obtain two if you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why not come with me? I &lsquo;m pressed, and must be up, if possible,
      before morning. Remember, we are forty-eight miles from Dublin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dublin! But I&rsquo;m going the very opposite road. I&rsquo;m for Westport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by Jove! that is different. What a stupid fellow the waiter is! Never
      mind; sit down. Let us have a glass of wine together. You shall have two
      of the horses. Old Wilkins must only make his spurs supply the place of
      the leaders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a hearty good-nature in every accent of the old man&rsquo;s voice, and
      Forester drew his chair to the table, by no means sorry to spend some time
      longer in his company.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a kind of conversation sacred to the occupations of the table,&mdash;a
      mixture of the culinary and the social, the gustatory with the agreeable.
      And the stranger led the way to this, with the art of an accomplished
      proficient, and while recommending the good things to Forester&rsquo;s
      attention, contrived to season their enjoyment by a tone at once pleasing
      and cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have sworn you were hungry,&rdquo; said he, laughing, as Forester
      helped himself for the second time to the grouse-pie. &ldquo;I know you did not
      expect so appetizing a supper in such a place; but Rickards has always
      something in the larder for an old acquaintance, and I have been
      travelling this road close upon sixty years now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a dreary way it is,&rdquo; said Forester, &ldquo;except for this most agreeable
      incident. I never came so many miles before with so little to interest
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true; it is a flat, monotonous-looking country, and poor besides;
      but nothing like what I remember it as a boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surely do not mean that the people were ever worse off than they seem
      now to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, a hundred times worse off. They may be rack-rented and over-taxed in
      some instances now,&mdash;not as many as you would suppose, after all,&mdash;but
      then, they were held in actual slavery, nearly famished, and all but
      naked; no roads, no markets; subject to the caprice of the landowners on
      every occasion in life, and the faction fights&mdash;those barbarous
      vestiges of a rude time&mdash;kept up and encouraged by those who should
      have set the better example of mutual charity and good feeling. These
      unhappy practices have not disappeared, but they are far less frequent
      than formerly; and however the confession may seem to you a sad one, to me
      there is a pride in saying, Ireland is improving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hard to conceive a people more miserably off than these,&rdquo; said
      Forester, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they seem to your eyes; but let me remark that there is a transition
      state between rude barbarism and civilization which always appears more
      miserable than either; habits of life which suggest wants that can rarely,
      if ever, be supplied. The struggle between poverty and the desire for
      better, is a bitter conflict, and such is the actual condition of this
      people. You are young enough to witness the fruits of the reformation; I
      am too old ever to hope to see them, but I feel assured that the day is
      coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like your theory well; it has Hope for its ally,&rdquo; said Forester, as he
      gazed on the benevolent features of the old squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has even better, sir, it has truth; and hence it is that the
      peasantry, as they approach nearer to the capital,&mdash;the seat of
      civilization,&mdash;have fewest of those traits that please or attract
      strangers; they are in the transition state I speak of; while down in <i>my</i>
      wild country, you can see them in their native freshness, reckless and
      improvident, but light-hearted and happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where may the country be you speak of, sir?&rdquo; said Forester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Far West, beside the Atlantic. You have heard of Mayo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is my destination at this moment; I am going beyond Westport, to
      visit one of the chieftains there. I have not the honor to know him, but I
      conclude that his style of living and habits will not be a bad specimen of
      the gentry customs generally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that neighborhood tolerably well. May I ask the name of your
      future host?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Knight of Gwynne is his title&mdash;Mr. Darcy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! an old acquaintance,&mdash;I may almost say an old friend of mine,&rdquo;
       said the other, smiling. &ldquo;And so you are going to pass some time at
      Gywnne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A week or so; I scarcely think I can spare more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They &lsquo;ll call that a very inhospitable visit at Gwynne, sir; the Knight&rsquo;s
      guests rarely stay less than a month. I have just left it, and there were
      some there who had been since the beginning of the partridge-shooting, and
      not the least welcome of the party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry I had not the good fortune to meet you there,&rdquo; said Forester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make your visit a fortnight, and I &lsquo;ll join you, then,&rdquo; said the old man,
      gayly. &ldquo;I &lsquo;m going up to town to settle a wager,&mdash;a foolish
      excursion, you &lsquo;ll say, at my time of life; but it&rsquo;s too late to mend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horses is put to, sir,&rdquo; said the waiter, announcing the fact for
      something like the fourth time, without being attended to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, it is time to start. Am I to take it as a pledge that I shall
      find you at Gwynne this day fortnight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot answer for my host,&rdquo; said Forester, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! old Darcy is sure to ask you to stay. By the way, would you permit me
      to trouble you with five lines to a friend who is now stopping there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; I shall be but too happy to be of any service to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman sat down, and, tearing a leaf from a capacious
      pocket-book, wrote a few hurried lines, which, having folded and sealed,
      he addressed, &ldquo;Bagenal Daly, Esquire, Gwynne Abbey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s my commission; pray add my service to the Knight himself,
      when you see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to ask, how shall I designate his friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I forgot, you don&rsquo;t know me,&rdquo; said he, laughing. &ldquo;I have half a mind
      to leave the identification with your own descriptive powers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d wager five guineas I could make the portrait a resemblance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done, then; I take the bet,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;and I promise you, on the
      word of a gentleman, I am known to every visitor in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Each laughed heartily at the drollery of such a wager, and, with many a
      profession of the pleasure a future meeting would afford to both, they
      parted, less like casual acquaintances than as old and intimate friends.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. GWYNNE ABBEY
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Forester parted with his chance companion at Kilbeggan, he pursued
      his way without meeting a single incident worth recording; nor, although
      he travelled with all the speed of posters, aided by the persuasive power
      of additional half-crowns, shall we ask of our reader to accompany him,
      but, at one bound, cross the whole island, and stand with us on the margin
      of that glorious sheet of water which, begirt with mountains and studded
      with its hundred islands, is known as Clue Bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the southern extremity of the bay rises the great mountain of Croagh
      Patrick, its summit nearly five thousand feet above the sea; on the side
      next the ocean, it is bold and precipitous, crag rising above crag in
      succession, and not even the track of a mountain goat visible on the
      dangerous surface; landward, however, a gentle slope descends about the
      lower third of the mountain, and imperceptibly is lost in the rich and
      swelling landscape beneath. Here, sheltered from the western gales, and
      favored by the fertility of the soil, the trees are seen to attain a girth
      and height rarely met with elsewhere, while they preserve their foliage to
      a much later period than in other parts of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ruins of an ancient church, whose very walls are washed by the
      Atlantic, show that the luxuriant richness of the spot was known in times
      past. They who founded these goodly edifices were no mean judges of the
      resources of the land, and the rich woods and blossoming orchards that
      still shelter their ruined shrines evidence with what correctness they
      selected their resting-places.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coast-road which leads from Westport skirts along the edge of the bay,
      and is diversified by many a pretty cottage whose trellised walls and
      rose-covered porches vouch for the mildness of the climate, and are in
      summer resorted to as bathing-lodges by numbers from the inland counties.
      The high-road has, however, a grander destiny than to such humble, though
      picturesque, dwellings, for it suddenly ceases at the gate of an immense
      demesne, whose boundary wall may be seen stretching away for miles, and at
      last is traced high up the mountain side, where it forms the enclosure of
      a deer park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two square and massive towers connected by an arch form the gateway, and
      though ivy and honeysuckle have covered many an architectural device which
      once were looked on with pride, a massive armorial escutcheon in yellow
      stone forms the key of the arch, while two leopards supporting a crown,
      with the motto, &ldquo;Ne la touchez pas!&rdquo; proclaim the territory of the Knight
      of Gwynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within, an avenue wide enough for a high-road led through a park of great
      extent, dotted with trees single or in groups, and bounded by a vast wood,
      whose waving tops were seen for miles of distance. If a landscape-gardener
      would have deplored with uplifted hands the glorious opportunities of
      embellishment which neglect or ignorance had suffered to lie undeveloped
      within these grounds, a true lover of scenery would have felt delighted at
      the wild and picturesque beauty around him, as, sometimes, the road would
      dip into a deep glade, where the overhanging banks were clothed with the
      dog-rose and the sweet-brier, still and hushed to every sound save the
      song of the thrush or the not less sweet ripple of the little stream that
      murmured past; and again, emerging from the shade, it wound along some
      height whence the great mountain might be seen, or, between the dark
      foliage, the blue surface of the sea, swelling and heaving with
      ever-restless motion. All the elements of great picturesque beauty were
      here, and in that glorious profusion with which nature alone diffuses her
      wealth,&mdash;the mountain, the forest, and the ocean, the greensward, the
      pebbly shore, the great rocks, the banks blue with the violet and the
      veronica,&mdash;and all diversified and contrasted to produce effects the
      most novel and enchanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a road and many a pathway led through these woods and valleys, some
      grass-grown, as though disused, others bearing the track of recent wheels,
      still, as you went, the hares and the rabbits felt no terror, the
      wood-pigeon sat upon the branch above your head, nor was scared at your
      approach; for though the Knight was a passionate lover of sport, it was
      his fancy to preserve the demesne intact, nor would he suffer a shot to be
      fired within its precincts. These may seem small and insignificant matters
      to record, but they added indescribably to the charms of the spot,
      completing, as they did, the ideas of tranquillity and peace suggested by
      the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The approach was of some miles in extent, not needlessly prolonged by
      every device of sweep and winding, but in reality proceeding by its
      nearest way to the house, which, for the advantage of a view over the sea,
      was situated on the slope of the mountain. Nor was the building unworthy
      of its proud position: originally an abbey, its architecture still
      displayed the elaborate embellishment which characterized the erections of
      the latter part of the sixteenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long façade, interrupted at intervals by square towers, formed the
      front, the roof consisting of a succession of tall and pointed gables, in
      each of which some good saint stood enshrined in stone; the windows,
      throughout this long extent, were surmounted by pediments and figures not
      rudely chiselled, but with high pretension as works of art, and evidencing
      both taste and skill in the designer; while the great entrance was a
      miracle of tracery and carving, the rich architraves retreating one within
      another to the full depth of twelve feet, such being the thickness of the
      external wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spacious and imposing as this great mass of building appeared at first
      sight, it formed but a fragment of the whole, and was in reality but the
      side of a great quadrangle, the approach to which led through one of the
      large towers, defended by fosse and drawbridge, while overhead the iron
      spikes of a massive portcullis might be seen; for the Abbot of Gwynne had
      been a &ldquo;puissance&rdquo; in days long past, and had his servitors in steel, as
      well as his followers in sackcloth. This road, which was excessively steep
      and difficult of access, was yet that by which carriages were accustomed
      to approach the house; for the stables occupied one entire wing of the
      quadrangle, the servants, of whom there were a goodly company, holding
      possession of the suite of rooms overhead, once the ancient dormitory of
      the monks of Gwynne.
    </p>

      In the middle of the courtyard was a large fountain, over which an effigy
      of St. Francis had formerly stood; but the saint had unhappily been used
      as a lay figure whereupon to brush hunting-coats and soiled leathers, and
      gradually his proportions had suffered grievous injury, till at last
      nothing remained of him save the legs, which were still profaned as a
      saddle-tree; for grooms and stable-boys are irreverent in their notions,
      and, probably, deemed it no disgrace for a saint to carry such honorable
      trappings.

      The appearance of the abbey from within was even more picturesque than
      when seen from the outside, each side of the quadrangle displaying a
      different era and style of architecture; for they had been built with long
      intervals of time between them, and one wing, a low, two-storied range,
      with jail-like windows and a small, narrow portal, bore, on a
      three-cornered stone, the date 1304.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall not ask of our readers to accompany us further in our dry
      description, nor even cast a glance up at that myriad of strange beasts
      which, in dark gray stone, are frowning or grinning, or leaping or
      rearing, from every angle and corner of the building,&mdash;a strange
      company, whose representatives in real life it would puzzle the zoologist
      to produce; but there they were, some with a coat-of-arms between their
      paws, some supporting an ornamental capital, and others actually, as it
      seemed, cutting their uncouth capers out of pure idleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the back of the abbey, and terraced on the mountain side, lay a perfect
      wilderness of flower-gardens and fishponds, amid which a taste more
      profane than that of the founders had erected sundry summer-houses in
      rockwork, hermitages without hermits, and shrines without worshippers, but
      all moss-grown, and old enough to make them objects of curiosity, while
      some afforded glorious points of view over the distant bay and the rich
      valley where stands the picturesque town of Westport.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior of this noble edifice was worthy of its appearance from
      without. Independent of the ample accommodation for a great household,
      there was a suite of state apartments running along the entire front and
      part of one wing, and these were fitted up and furnished with a luxury and
      costliness that would not have disgraced a royal palace. Here were seen
      velvet hangings and rich tapestries upon the walls, floors inlaid with
      tulip and sandal-wood, windows of richly stained glass threw a mysterious
      and mellow light over richly carved furniture, the triumphs of that art
      which the Netherlands once boasted; cabinets, curiously inlaid with silver
      and tortoiseshell, many of them gifts of distinguished donors, few without
      their associations of story; while one chamber, the ancient hall of
      audience, was hung round with armor and weapons, the trophies of
      long-buried ancestors, the proud memorials of a noble line; dark suits of
      Milan mail, or richly inlaid cuirasses of Spanish workmanship, with great
      two-handed swords and battle-axes, and, stranger still, weapons of Eastern
      mould and fashion, for more than one of the house had fought against the
      Turks, and crossed his broadsword with the scimitar.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were objects rare and curious enough within these walls to stay and
      linger over; but even if we dared to take such a liberty with our reader,
      our duty would not permit the dalliance, and it is to a very different
      part of the building, and one destined for far other uses, that we must
      now for a brief space conduct him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a small chamber of the ground-floor, whose curiously groined roof and
      richly stained window showed that its occupancy had once been held by
      those in station above the common, now sat two persons at a well-garnished
      table, while before them, on the wide hearth, blazed a cheerful fire of
      bog deal. On either side of the fireplace was a niche, in which formerly
      some saintly effigy had stood, but now&mdash;such are Time&rsquo;s chances&mdash;an
      earthenware pitcher, with a pewter lid, decorated each, of whose contents
      the boon companions drank jovially to each other. One of these was a
      short, fat old fellow of nigh eighty years; his bowed legs and wide round
      shoulders the still surviving signs of great personal strength in days
      gone by; his hair, white as snow, was carefully brushed back from his
      forehead, and tied into &ldquo;queue&rdquo; behind. Old as he was, the features were
      intelligent and pleasing, the hale and hearty expression of good health
      and good temper animated them when he spoke, nor were the words the less
      mellow to an Irish ear that they smacked of the &ldquo;sweet south,&rdquo; for Tate
      Sullivan was a Kerry man, and possessed in full measure the attributes of
      that pleasant kingdom; he was courteous and obliging, faithful in his
      affections, and if a bit hasty in temper, the very first to discover and
      correct it. His failing was the national one,&mdash;the proneness to
      conceal a truth if its disclosure were disagreeable: he could not bring
      himself to bear bad tidings; and this tendency had so grown with years
      that few who knew his weakness could trust any version of a fact from his
      lips without making due allowance for blarney.

      For eight-and-forty years he had been a butler in the Knight&rsquo;s family, and
      his reverence for his master went on increasing with his years; in his
      eyes he was the happy concentration of every good quality of humanity, nor
      could he bring himself to believe that his like would ever come again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite to him sat one as unlike him in form and appearance as he was in
      reality by character: a gaunt, thin, hollow-cheeked man of sixty-six or
      seven, rueful and sad-looking, with a greenish gray complexion, and a head
      of short, close gray hair, cut horseshoe fashion over the temples, his
      long thin nose, pointed chin, and his cold green eye only wanted the
      additional test of his accent to pronounce him from the North. So it was,
      Sandy M&rsquo;Grane was from Antrim, and a keener specimen of the &ldquo;cold
      countrie&rdquo; need not have been looked for.
    </p>
    <p>
      His dress was a wide-skirted, deep-cuffed brown coat, profusely studded
      with large silver buttons richly crested, one sleeve of which, armless and
      empty, was attached to his breast; a dark-crimson waistcoat, edged with
      silver lace, descended below the hips; black leather breeches and high
      black boots,&mdash;a strange costume, uniting in some respects the
      attributes of in-door life and the road. On the high back of his oaken
      chair hung a wide-brimmed felt hat and a black leather belt, from which a
      short straight sword depended, the invariable companion of his journeys;
      for Sandy had travelled in strange lands, where protective police were
      unknown, and his master, Mr. Bagenal Daly, was one who ever preferred his
      own administration of criminal law, when the occasion required such, to
      the slower process of impartial justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meagre and fleshless as he looked, he was possessed of great personal
      strength, and it needed no acute physiognomist to pronounce, from the
      character of his head and features, that courage had not been omitted
      among the ingredients of his nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      A word of explanation may be necessary as to how a western gentleman, as
      Bagenal Daly was, should have attached to his person for some forty years
      a native of a distant county, and one all whose habits and sympathies
      seemed so little in unison with his own part of the country. Short as the
      story is, we should not feel warranted in obtruding it on our readers if
      it did not to a certain extent serve to illustrate the characters of both
      master and man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Daly when a very young man chanced to make an excursion to the
      northern part of the island, the principal object of which was to see the
      Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, and the scenery in the neighborhood. The visit was
      undertaken with little foresight or precaution, and happened at the very
      time of the year when severe gales from the north and west prevail, and a
      heavy sea breaks along that iron-bound coast. Having come so far to see
      the spot, he was unwilling to be baulked in his object; but still, the
      guides and boatmen of the neighborhood refused to venture out, and,
      notwithstanding the most tempting offers, would not risk their lives by an
      enterprise so full of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daly&rsquo;s ardor for the expedition seemed to increase as the difficulty to
      its accomplishment grew greater, and he endeavored, now by profuse offers
      of money, now by taunting allusions to their want of courage, to stimulate
      the men to accompany him; when, at last, a tall, hard-featured young
      fellow stood forward and offered, if Daly himself would pull an oar, to go
      along with him. Overjoyed at his success, Daly agreed to the proposal; and
      although a heavy sea was then running, and the coast for miles was covered
      with fragments of a wreck, the skiff was Boon launched, and stood out to
      sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ga wi&rsquo;ye to the twa caves and Dunluce; but I &lsquo;ll no engage to ga to
      Carrig-a-rede,&rdquo; said Sandy, as the sea broke in masses on the bow, and
      fell in torrents over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After about an hour&rsquo;s rowing, during which the boat several times narrowly
      escaped being swamped, and was already more than half full of water, they
      arrived off the great cave, and could see the boiling surf as, sent back
      with force, it issued beneath the rock, with a music louder than thunder,
      while from the great cliffs overhead the water poured in a thick shower,
      as each receding wave left a part behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cobble&rdquo; (so is the boat termed there) &ldquo;is aye drawing in to shore,&rdquo;
       said Sandy; &ldquo;I trow we &lsquo;d better pull back, noo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till we &lsquo;ve seen Carrig-a-rede, surely,&rdquo; said Daly, on whom danger
      acted like the most exciting of all stimulants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye may go there by yersel,&rdquo; said Sandy, &ldquo;when ye put me ashore; I tauld
      you, I &lsquo;d no ga so far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, it&rsquo;s no time to flinch now,&rdquo; said Daly; &ldquo;turn her head about,
      and lean down to your oar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll no do it,&rdquo; said Sandy, &ldquo;nor will I let you either.&rdquo; And as he
      spoke, he leaned forward to take the oar from Daly&rsquo;s hand. The young man,
      irritated at the attempt, rudely repulsed him, and Sandy, whose temper, if
      not as violent, was at least as determined, grappled with him at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll upset the boat&mdash;curse the fellow!&rdquo; said Daly, who now found
      that he had met his match in point of strength and daring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go the oar, man,&rdquo; cried Sandy, savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Daly, with a violent effort to free his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then swim for it, if ye like better,&rdquo; said Sandy; and, placing one foot
      on the gunwale, he gave a tremendous push, and the next instant they were
      both struggling in the sea. For a long time they continued, almost side by
      side, to buffet the dark water; but at last Daly began to falter, his
      efforts became more labored, and his strength seemed failing; Sandy turned
      his head, and seized him in the very struggle that precedes sinking. They
      were still far from shore, but the hardy Northern never hesitated; he held
      him by the arm, and after a long and desperate effort succeeded in gaining
      the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye got a bra wetting for your pains, anyhow,&rdquo; said Sandy; &ldquo;but I &lsquo;m no
      the best off either: I &lsquo;ll never see the cobble mair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such were the first words Bagenal Daly heard when consciousness returned
      to him; the rest of the story is soon told. Daly took Sandy into his
      service, not without all due thought and consideration on the latter&rsquo;s
      part, for he owned a small fishing-hut, for which he expected and received
      due compensation, as well as for the cobble and the damage to his
      habiliments by salt water,&mdash;all matters of which, as they were left
      to his own uncontrolled valuation, he was well satisfied with the
      arrangement; and thus began a companionship which had lasted to the very
      moment we have presented him to our readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is but fair to say that in all this time no one had ever heard from
      Sandy&rsquo;s lips one syllable of the adventure we have related, nor did he
      ever, in the remotest degree, allude to it in intercourse with his master.
      Sandy was little disposed to descant either on the life or the character
      of his master; the Scotch element of caution was mingled strongly through
      his nature, and he preferred any other topic of conversation than such as
      led to domestic events. Whether that he was less on his guard on this
      evening, or that, esteeming Tate&rsquo;s perceptions at no very high rate, so it
      is, he talked more freely and unadvisedly than was his wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye hae a bra berth o&rsquo; it here, Maister Sullivan,&rdquo; said he, as he smacked
      his lips after the smoking compound, whose odor pronounced it mulled port;
      &ldquo;I maun say, that a man wha has seen a good deal of life might do far war&rsquo;
      than settle down in a snug little nook like this; maybe, ye hae no
      journeyed far in your time either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, &lsquo;tis true for you, Mr. M&rsquo;Grane, I had not the opportunities you
      had of seeing the world, and the strange people in foreign parts; they
      tell me you was in Jericho, and Jerusalem, and Gibraltar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Further than that, Maister Sullivan. I hae been in very curious places
      wi&rsquo; Mr. Daly; this day nine years we were in the Rocky Mountains, among
      the Red Indians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Red Indians! blood alive! them was dangerous neighbors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in our case. My master was a chief among them, I was the doctor of
      the tribe,&mdash;the &lsquo;Great Mystery Man,&rsquo; they cau&rsquo;d me; my master&rsquo;s name
      was the &lsquo;Howling Wind.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorra doubt, but it was not a bad one,&mdash;listen to him now;&rdquo; and Tate
      lifted his hand to enforce silence, while a cheer loud and sonorous rang
      out, and floated in rich cadence along the arched corridors of the old
      abbey; &ldquo;&lsquo;tis singing he is,&rdquo; added Tate, lower, while he opened the door
      to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no a sang, that&rsquo;s the war-cry of the Manhattas,&rdquo; said Sandy,
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The saints be praised it&rsquo;s no worse!&rdquo; remarked Tate, with pious horror in
      every feature. &ldquo;I thought he was going to raise the divil. And who was the
      man-haters, Mr. M&rsquo;Grane?&rdquo; added he, meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A vara fine set o&rsquo; people; a leetle fond o&rsquo; killing and eating their
      neighbors, but friendly and ceevil to strangers; I hae a wife amang them
      mysel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wife! Is she a Christian, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nae muck le o&rsquo; that, but a douce, good-humored lassie for a&rsquo; that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she&rsquo;sa black?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na, na; she was a rich copper tint, something deeper than my waistcoat
      here, but she had twa yellow streaks over her forehead, and the tip o&rsquo; her
      nose was blue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mother of Heaven be near us! she was a beauty, by all accounts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that she was; the best-looking squaw of the tribe, and rare handy wi&rsquo;
      a hatchet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil fear her,&rdquo; muttered Tate, between his teeth. &ldquo;And what was her
      name, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her name was Orroawaccanaboo, the &lsquo;Jumping Wild Cat.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, holy Moses!&rdquo; exclaimed Tate, unable any longer to subdue his
      feelings, &ldquo;I would n&rsquo;t be her husband for a mine of goold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are no sae far wrong there, my auld chap,&rdquo; said Sandy, without
      showing any displeasure at this burst of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr. Daly, had he another&mdash;of these craytures?&rdquo; said Tate, who
      felt scruples in applying the epithet of the Church in such a predicament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had twa,&rdquo; said Sandy, &ldquo;forbye anein the mountains, that was too auld
      to come down; puir lone body, she was unco&rsquo; fond of a child&rsquo;s head and
      shoulders wi&rsquo; fish gravy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To ate it! Do you mane for ating, Mr. M&rsquo;Grane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, just so; butchers&rsquo; shops is no sae plenty down in them parts. But
      what&rsquo;s that! dinna ye hear a ringing o&rsquo; the bell at the gate there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear nothing, I can think of nothing! sorra bit! with the thought of
      that ould baste in my head, bad luck to her!&rdquo; exclaimed Tate, ruefully. &ldquo;A
      child&rsquo;s head and shoulders! Sure enough, that&rsquo;s the bell, and them that&rsquo;s
      ringing it knows the way, too.&rdquo; And with these words Tate lighted his
      lantern and issued forth to the gate tower, the keys of which were each
      night deposited in his care.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the massive gates fell back, four splashed and heated horses drew
      forward a calèche, from which, disengaging himself with speed, Dick
      Forester descended, and endeavored, as well as the darkness would permit,
      to survey the great pile of building around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming to stop, yer honor?&rdquo; said Tate, courteously uncovering his white
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Will you present these letters and this card to your master?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must show you your room first,&mdash;that&rsquo;s my orders always.&mdash;Tim,
      bring up this luggage to 27.&mdash;Will yer honor have supper in the hall,
      or in your own dressing-room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing more decisive as to the general tone of hospitality
      pervading any house than the manner of the servants towards strangers; and
      thus, few and simple as the old butler&rsquo;s words were, they were amply
      sufficient to satisfy Forester that his reception would be a kindly one,
      even though less ably accredited than by Lionel Darcy&rsquo;s introduction; and
      he followed Tate Sullivan with the pleasant consciousness that he was to
      lay his head beneath a friendly roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the supper,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;a good night&rsquo;s rest is what I stand
      most in need of. Show me to my room, and to-morrow I &lsquo;ll pay my respects
      to the Knight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way then, sir,&rdquo; said Tate, entering a large hall, and leading the
      way up a wide oak staircase, at the top of which was a corridor of immense
      extent. Turning short at the head of this, Tate opened a small empanelled
      door, and with a gesture of caution moved forwards. Forester followed, not
      a little curious to know the meaning of the precaution, and at the same
      instant the loud sounds of merry voices laughing and talking reached him,
      but from what quarter he could not guess, when, suddenly, his guide drew
      back a heavy cloth curtain, and he perceived that they were traversing a
      long gallery, which ran along the entire length of a great room, in the
      lower part of which a large company was assembled. So sudden and
      unexpected was the sight that Forester started with amazement, and stood
      uncertain whether to advance or retire, while Tate Sullivan, as if
      enjoying his surprise, leaned his hands on his knees and stared steadily
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene below was indeed enough to warrant his astonishment. In the
      great hail, which had once been the refectory of the abbey, a party of
      about thirty gentlemen were now seated around a table covered with
      drinking vessels of every shape and material, as the tastes of the guests
      inclined their potations. Claret, in great glass jugs holding the quantity
      of two or three ordinary bottles; port, in huge square decanters, both
      being drunk from the wood, as was the fashion of the day; large china
      bowls of mulled wine, in which the oranges and limes floated fragrantly;
      and here and there a great measure made of wood and hooped with silver,
      called the &ldquo;mether,&rdquo; contained the native beverage in all its simplicity,
      and supplied the hard drinker with the liquor he preferred to all,&mdash;&ldquo;poteen.&rdquo;
       The guests were no less various than the good things of which they
      partook. Old, young, and middle-aged; some men stamped with the air and
      seeming of the very highest class; others as undeniably drawn from the
      ranks of the mere country squire; a few were dressed in all the accuracy
      of dinner costume; some wore the well-known livery of Daly&rsquo;s Club, and
      others were in the easy negligence of morning dress; while, scattered up
      and down, could be seen the red coat of a hunter, whose splashed and
      stained scarlet spoke rather for the daring than the dandyism of its
      wearer. But conspicuous above all was a figure who, on an elevated seat,
      sat at the head of the table and presided over the entertainment. He was a
      tall&mdash;a very tall&mdash;and powerfully built man, whose age might
      have been guessed at anything, from five-and-forty to seventy; for though
      his frame and figure indicated few touches of time, his seared and
      wrinkled forehead boded advanced life. His head was long and narrow, and
      had been entirely bald, were it not for a single stripe of coal-black hair
      which grew down the very middle of it, and came to a point on the
      forehead, looking exactly like the scalplock of an Indian warrior. The
      features were long and melancholy in expression,&mdash;a character
      increased by a drooping moustache of black hair, the points of which
      descended below the chin. His eyes were black as a raven&rsquo;s wing, and
      glanced with all the brilliancy and quickness of youth, while the
      incessant motion of his arched eyebrows gave to their expression a
      character of almost demoniac intelligence. His voice was low and sonorous,
      and, although unmistakably Irish in accent, occasionally lapsed into
      traits which might be called foreign, for no one that knew him would have
      accused him of the vice of affectation. His dress was a claret-colored
      coat edged with narrow silver lace, and a vest of white satin, over which,
      by a blue ribbon, hung the medal of a foreign order; white satin breeches
      and silk stockings, with shoes fastened by large diamond buckles,
      completed a costume which well became a figure that had lost nothing of
      its pretension to shapeliness and symmetry. His hands, though remarkably
      large and bony, were scrupulously white and cared for, and more than one
      ring of great value ornamented his huge and massive fingers. Altogether,
      he was one whom the least critical would have pronounced not of the common
      herd of humanity, and yet whose character was by no means so easy to guess
      at from external traits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid all the tumult and confusion of the scene, his influence seemed felt
      everywhere, and his rich, solemn tones could be heard high above the crash
      and din around. As Forester stood and leaned over the balcony, the noise
      seemed to have reached its utmost; one of the company&mdash;a short,
      square, bull-faced little squire&mdash;being interrupted in a song by some
      of the party, while others&mdash;the greater number&mdash;equally loud,
      called on him to proceed. It was one of the slang ditties of the time,&mdash;a
      lyric suggested by that topic which furnished matter for pamphlets and
      speeches and songs, dinners, debates, and even duels,&mdash;the Union.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Bodkin; go on, man! You never were in better voice in your life,&rdquo;
       mingled with, &ldquo;No, no; why introduce any party topic here?&rdquo;&mdash;with a
      murmured remark: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfair, too. Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly is with the
      Government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tumult, which, without being angry, increased every moment, was at
      last stilled by the voice of the chairman, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the song have a moral, Bodkin&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has, I pledge my honor it has, your &lsquo;Grandeur.&rsquo;&rdquo; said Bodkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then finish it. Silence there, gentlemen.&rdquo; And Bodkin resumed his chant:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;&lsquo;Trust me, Squire,&rsquo; the dark man cried,
     &lsquo;I &lsquo;ll follow close and mind you,
     Nor however high the fence you ride,
     I &lsquo;ll ever be far behind you.&rsquo;

     &ldquo;And true to his word, like a gentleman
     He rode, there &lsquo;a no denying;
     And though full twenty miles they ran,
     He took all his ditches flying.

     &ldquo;The night now came, and down they sat,
     And the Squire drank while he was able;
     But though glass for glass the dark man took,
     He left him under the table.

     &ldquo;When morning broke, the Squire&rsquo;s brains,
     Though racking, were still much clearer.
     &lsquo;I know you well,&rsquo; said he to his guest,
     &lsquo;Now that I see you nearer.

     &ldquo;&lsquo;You &lsquo;ve play&rsquo;d me a d&mdash;&mdash;d scurvy trick:
     Come, what have I lost&mdash;don&rsquo;t tease me.
     Is it my soul?&rsquo;   &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; says Nick;
     &lsquo;Just vote for the Union, to please me.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Amid the loud hurrahs and the louder laughter that fol-lowed this rude
      chant Forester hurried on to his room, fully convinced that his mission
      was not altogether so promising as he anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undeniable in every respect as was the accommodation of his bed-chamber,
      Forester lay awake half the night, the singular circumstances in which he
      found himself occupied his thoughts, while at intervals came the swelling
      sounds of some loud cheers from the party below, whose boisterous gayety
      seemed to continue without interruption.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. THE DINNER-PARTY
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was late on the following day when Forester awoke, nor was it for some
      time that he could satisfy himself how far he had been an actor, or a mere
      spectator in the scene he had witnessed the preceding night. The room and
      the guests were vividly impressed upon his memory, and the excitement of
      the party, so different in its character from anything he had seen in his
      own country, convinced him that the sea, narrow as it was, separated two
      races very unlike in temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      What success should he have in this, his first, mission? was the question
      ever rising to his mind; how should he acquit himself among persons to
      whose habits of life, thought, and expression he felt himself an utter
      stranger? Little as he had seen of the party, that little showed him that
      the anti-Union feeling was in the ascendant, and that, if a stray convert
      to the Ministerial doctrines was here and there to be found, he was rather
      ashamed of his new convictions than resolute to uphold and defend them.
      From these thoughts he wandered on to others, about the characters of the
      party, and principally of the host himself, who in every respect was
      unlike his anticipations. He opened his friend Lionel&rsquo;s letter, and was
      surprised to find how filial affection had blinded his judgment,&mdash;keen
      enough when exercised without the trammels of prejudice. &ldquo;If this,&rdquo;
       thought he, &ldquo;be a fair specimen of Lionel&rsquo;s portrait-painting, I must take
      care to form no high-flown expectations of his mother and sister; and as
      he calls one somewhat haughty and reserved in manner, and the other a
      blending of maternal pride with a dash of his father&rsquo;s wilful but happy
      temperament, I take it for granted that Lady Eleanor is a cold,
      disagreeable old lady, and her daughter Helen a union of petted vanity and
      capriciousness, pretty much what my good friend Lionel himself was when he
      joined us, but what he had the good sense to cease to be very soon after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having satisfied himself that he fairly estimated the ladies of the house,
      he set himself, with all the ingenuity of true speculation, to account for
      the traits of character he had so good-naturedly conferred on them.
      &ldquo;Living in a remote, half-civilized neighborhood,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;without
      any intercourse save with some country squires and their wives and
      daughters, they have learned, naturally enough, to feel their own
      superiority to those about them; and possessing a place with such claims
      to respect from association, as well as from its actual condition, they,
      like all people who have few equals and no superiors, give themselves a
      license to think and act independent of the world&rsquo;s prescription, and
      become, consequently, very intolerable to every one unaccustomed to
      acknowledge their sovereignty. I heartily wish Lionel had left these
      worthy people to my own unassisted appreciation of them; his flourish of
      trumpets has sadly spoiled the effect of the scene for me;&rdquo; and with this
      not over gracious reflection he proceeded to dress for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The squire has been twice at the door this morning, sir,&rdquo; said Lin wood,
      as he arranged the dressing apparatus on the table; &ldquo;he would not let me
      awake you, however, and at last said, &lsquo;Present my cordial respects to Mr.
      Forester, and say, that if he should like to ride with the hounds, he&rsquo;ll
      find a horse ready for him, and a servant who will show him the way.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are they out already?&rdquo; said Forester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, gone two hours ago; they breakfasted at eight, and I heard a
      whipper-in say they &lsquo;d twelve miles to go to the first cover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it appeared to me that they were up all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They broke up at four, sir, and except two gentlemen that are gone over
      to Westport on business, but to be back for dinner, they&rsquo;re all mounted
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is the dinner-hour, Linwood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six, sir, to the minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s now only eleven,&rdquo; said Forester to himself, with a wearied sigh;
      &ldquo;how am I to get through the rest of the day? Are the ladies in the
      drawing-room, Linwood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies! no, sir; there are no ladies in the house as I hear of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better, then,&rdquo; thought his master; &ldquo;passive endurance is
      better any day than active boredom, and with all respect for Lady Eleanor
      and her daughter, I &lsquo;d rather believe them such as Lionel paints them,
      than have the less flattering impression nearer acquaintance would as
      certainly leave behind it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old butler wishes to know if you will breakfast in the library, sir?&rdquo;
       asked Linwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that will do admirably; delighted I am to hear there is such a thing
      here,&rdquo; muttered he; for already he had suffered the disappointment the
      host&rsquo;s appearance had caused him to tinge all his thoughts with
      bitterness, and make him regard his visit as an act of purgatorial
      endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a large and well-furnished library, with a projecting window offering a
      view over the entire of Clue Bay, Forester found a small breakfast-table
      laid beside the fireplace. From the aspect of comfort in everything
      around, to the elegance of the little service of Dresden, with its
      accompaniment of ancient silver, the most fastidious critic would not have
      withheld his praise, and the young Englishman fell into a puzzled revery
      how so much of taste for the refinements of daily life could consort with
      the strange specimen of society he had witnessed the preceding evening.
      The book-shelves, too, in all their later acquisitions, exhibited judgment
      in the works selected, and as Forester ran his eye over the titles, he was
      more than ever at fault to reconcile such readings with such habits. On
      the tables lay scattered the latest of those political pamphlets which the
      great contested question of the day evoked, many of them ably and
      powerfully written, and abounding in strong sarcasm; of these, the greater
      number were attacks on the meditated Union; some of them, too, bore
      pencil-marks and annotations, from which Forester collected that the
      Knight&rsquo;s party leanings were by no means to the Government side of the
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be hard, however,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;but some inducement may be found
      to tempt a man whose house and habits evidence such a taste for enjoyment;
      he must have ambitions of one kind or other, and if not for himself, his
      son, at least, must enter into his calculations. Your ascetic or your
      anchorite may be difficult to treat with, but show me the man with a good
      cook, a good stable, a good cellar, and the odds are there is a lurking
      void somewhere in his heart, to discover which is to have the mastery over
      him forever.&rdquo; Such were the conclusions the young aide-de-camp came to
      after long and mature thought, nor were they very unnatural in one whose
      short experience of life had shown him few, if any, exceptions to his
      theory. He deemed it possible, besides, that, although the Knight&rsquo;s
      politics should incline to the side of Opposition, there might be no very
      determined or decided objection to the plans of Government, and that,
      while proof against the temptations of vulgar bribery, he might be won
      over by the flatteries and seductions of which a Ministry can always be
      the dispensers. To open the negotiation with this view was then the great
      object with Forester, to sound the depth of the prejudices with which he
      had to deal, to examine their bearings and importance, to avoid even to
      ruffle the slightest of national susceptibilities, and to make it appear
      that, while Government could have little doubt of the justice of their own
      views, they would not permit a possibility of misconstruction to interfere
      with the certainty of securing the adhesion of one so eminent and
      influential as the Knight of Gwynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old adage has commemorated the facility of that arithmetic which
      consists in reckoning &ldquo;without one&rsquo;s host,&rdquo; and there are few men of warm
      and generous temperament who have not fallen, some time or other, into the
      error. Forester was certainly not the exception; and so thoroughly was he
      imbued with the spirit of his mission, and so completely captivated by the
      force of his own argument, that he walked up and down the ample apartment,
      repeating aloud, in broken and disjointed sentences, some of those
      irrefutable positions and plausible inducements by which he speculated on
      success. It was already the dusk of the evening, the short hours of a
      wintry day had hurried to a close, and, except where the bright glare of
      the wood fire was reflected on the polished oaken floor, all was shrouded
      in shadow within that spacious library. Now pushing aside some great
      deep-cushioned chair, now removing from his path the projecting end of a
      table, Forester succeeded in clearing a space in which, as he walked, he
      occasionally gave vent to such reflections as these:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The necessities of the Empire, growing power and influence of England,
      demand a consolidation of her interests and her efforts&mdash;this only to
      be effected by the Act of Union&mdash;an English Parliament, the real seat
      of legislation, and, as such, the suitable position for you, Sir Knight,
      whose importance will now increase with the sphere in which you exercise
      your abilities. I do not venture,&rdquo; said he, aloud, and with a voice
      attuned to its most persuasive accents,&mdash;&ldquo;I do not venture to discuss
      with you a question in which your opportunities and judgment have given
      you every advantage over me; I would merely direct your attention to those
      points on which my relative, Lord Castlereagh, founds the hopes of
      obtaining your support, and those views by which, in the success of the
      measure, a more extended field of utility will open before you. If I do
      not speak more fully on the gratitude which the Ministry will feel for
      your co-operation, and the pledges they are most ready and willing to
      advance, it is because I know&mdash;that is, I am certain that you&mdash;in
      fact, it is the conviction that&mdash;in short&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In short, it is because bribery is an ugly theme, sir, and, like a bad
      picture, only comes out the worse the more varnish you lay on it.&rdquo; These
      words, uttered in a low, solemn voice from a corner of the apartment,
      actually stunned Forester, who now stood peering through the gloom to
      where the indistinct figure of a man was seen seated in the recess of a
      large chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Captain Forester,&rdquo; said he, rising, and coming forward with
      his hand out; &ldquo;but it has so seldom been my fortune to hear any argument
      in defence of this measure that I could not bring myself to interrupt you
      before. Let me, however, perform a more pleasing task, in bidding you
      welcome to Gwynne Abbey. You slept well, I trust, for I left you in a
      happy unconsciousness of this world and its cares.&rdquo; It required all
      Forester&rsquo;s tact to subdue the uncomfortable sensations his surprise
      excited, and receive the proffered welcome with becoming cordiality. But
      in this he soon succeeded, not less from his own efforts than from the
      easy and familiar tone of the speaker. &ldquo;I have to thank you for a very
      pleasant note you were kind enough to bring me,&rdquo; continued he, as he
      seated himself beside the fire. &ldquo;And how have you left Dublin? Is the
      popular excitement as great as some weeks ago? or are the people beginning
      to see that they have nothing to say to a measure which, like venison and
      turtle, is a luxury only to be discussed by their betters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say that there is more of moderation in the tone of all parties
      of late,&rdquo; said Forester, diffidently, for he felt all the awkwardness of
      alluding to a topic in which his own game had been so palpably discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, your friends have gained the victory. Patriotism, as we
      call it in Ireland, requires to be fed by mob adulation; and when the
      &lsquo;canaille&rsquo; get hoarse, their idols walk over to the Treasury benches.&mdash;But
      there &lsquo;s the bell to dress; and I may as well tell you that we are the
      models of punctuality in this house, and you have only fifteen minutes for
      your toilet.&rdquo; With these words the old gentleman arose and strode out of
      the room, while Forester hastened, on his side, to prepare for the
      dinner-hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the aide-de-camp had accomplished his dressing, he found the party at
      table, where a vacant place was left for himself at the right hand of the
      host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We gave you three minutes&rsquo; grace, Captain Forester. I knew a candidate
      lose his election in the county by very little more,&rdquo;&mdash;and here he
      dropped his voice to a whisper, only audible to Forester,&mdash;&ldquo;and I&rsquo;d
      rather contract to keep the peace in a menagerie full of tigers than hold
      in check the passions of twenty hungry fox-hunters while waiting for
      dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forester cast his eyes over the table, and thought he perceived that his
      delay had not prepossessed the company in his favor. The glances which met
      his own round the board bore an expression of very unmistakable
      dissatisfaction, and although the conversation was free and unrestrained,
      he felt all the awkwardness of his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was at the time we speak of&mdash;has it quite disappeared even yet?&mdash;a
      very prevalent notion in most Irish circles that Englishmen in general,
      and English officials in particular, assumed airs of superiority over the
      natives of the country, treating them as very subordinate persons in all
      the relations in which good-breeding and social intercourse are concerned;
      and this impression, whether well or ill founded, induced many to suspect
      intentional insult in those chance occurrences which arise out of
      thoughtlessness and want of memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the party now assembled manifested any portion of this feeling, it was
      not sufficient to interrupt the flow of conversation, which took its
      course in channels the most various and dissimilar. The individuals were
      intimate, or, at least, familiar with each other, and, through all the
      topics of hunting, farming, politics, and horse-racing, ran a tone of free
      and easy raillery that kept a laugh moving up and down the table, or
      occasionally occupying it entirely. The little chill which marked
      Forester&rsquo;s first entrance into the room wore off soon, and ere the dinner
      was over he had drunk wine with nearly every man of the party, and
      accepted invitations to hunt, course, and shoot in at least a dozen
      different quarters. Lionel Darcy&rsquo;s friend, as he was soon known to be, was
      speedily made the object of every attention and civility among the younger
      members of the company, while even the older and less susceptible reserved
      their judgments on one they had at first received with some distrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forester had seen in the capital some specimens of those hard-drinking
      habits which characterized the period, but was still unprepared for the
      determined and resolute devotion to the bottle which at once succeeded to
      the dinner. The claret-jugs coursed round the table with a rapidity that
      seemed sleight of hand, and few refrained from filling a bumper every
      time. With all his determination to preserve a cool head and a calm
      judgment, Forester felt that, what between the noisy tumult of the scene,
      the fumes of wine, and the still more intoxicating excitement of this
      exaggerated conviviality, he could listen to tales of miraculous
      performances in the hunting-field, or feats of strength and activity more
      than mortal, with a degree of belief, or, at least, sufferance, he could
      scarcely have summoned a few hours earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      If wine expands the heart, it has a similar influence on the credulity;
      and belief, when divested of the trammels of cool judgment, takes a flight
      which even imagination might envy. It was in a frame of mind reduced to
      something like this, amid the loud voices of some, the louder laughter of
      others, strange and absurd bets as eagerly accepted as proffered, that he
      became suddenly mindful of his own wager made with the stranger at
      Kilbeggan, and the result of which he had pledged himself to test at the
      very first opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had he mentioned the fact than the interests of the company,
      directed before into so many different channels, became centred upon the
      circumstance, and questions and inquiries were rapidly poured in upon him
      to explain the exact nature of the wager, which in the then hallucination
      of the party was not an over-easy task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to describe the stranger, Captain Forester, and we are to guess
      his name: that I take it is the substance of the bet,&rdquo; said a thin-faced,
      dark-eyed man, with a soft silkiness of accent very unlike the others.
      This was Mr. Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly, member for the county, and colleague of
      &ldquo;the Knight&rdquo; himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is exactly what I mean. If my portrait be recognized, I &lsquo;ve won
      my bet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask another question?&rdquo; said Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly. &ldquo;Are we to pronounce only
      from the evidence before us, or are we at liberty to guess the party from
      other circumstances known to ourselves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, from the evidence only,&rdquo; interrupted a red-faced man of about
      five-and-thirty, with an air and manner which boded no small reliance on
      his own opinion; then, mimicking the solemnity of a judge, he addressed
      the assembled party thus: &ldquo;The gentlemen of the jury will dismiss from
      their minds everything they may hear touching the case outside this court,
      and base their verdict solely on the testimony they shall now hear.&rdquo; These
      few words were delivered in a pompous and snuffling tone, and, it was easy
      to see, from the laughter they excited, were an accurate imitation of some
      one well known to the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Alexander MacDonough was, however, a tolerably successful mimic, and
      had practised as an attorney until the death of an uncle enabled him to
      exercise his abilities in the not less crafty calling of a squireen
      gentleman; he was admitted by a kind of special favor into the best county
      society, for no other reason, as it seemed, than that it never occurred to
      any one to exclude him. He was a capital horseman, never turned from a
      fence in his life, and a noted shot with the pistol, in which his prowess
      had been more than once tried on &ldquo;the ground.&rdquo; Probably, however, these
      qualities would scarcely have procured him acceptance where he now sat, if
      it were not that he was looked upon as the necessary accompaniment of Mr.
      Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly and his son Beecham, not indeed to illustrate their
      virtues and display their good gifts, but as a species of moral blister,
      irritating and maddening them eternally.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had both more money and ambition than MacDonough, had taken higher
      and wider views of life, and were strenuously working up from the slough
      of a plebeian origin to the high and dry soil of patrician security. To
      them, MacDonough was a perfect curse; he was what sailors call &ldquo;a point of
      departure,&rdquo; everlastingly reminding them of the spot from which they had
      sailed, and tauntingly hinting how, with all their canvas spread, they had
      scarcely gained blue water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the O&rsquo;Reillys a few words are necessary. Three generations were still
      living, each depicting most strikingly the gradations by which successful
      thrift and industry transmute the man of humble position into the
      influential grade of an estated gentleman: the grandfather was an
      apothecary of Loughrea; the son, an agent, a money-lender, and an M. P.;
      and the grandson, an Etonian and a fellow-commoner of Balliol, emerging
      into life with the prospect of a great estate, unencumbered with debt,
      considerable county influence, and, not least of all, the <i>ricochet</i>
      of that favor with which the Government regarded his pliant parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      To all of these, MacDonough was insupportable, nor was there any visible
      escape from the insolent familiarity of his manner. Flattery had been
      tried in vain; all their blandishments could do nothing with one who well
      knew that his own acceptance into society depended on his powers of
      annoying; if not performing the part of torturer, he had no share in the
      piece; a quarrel with him was equally out of the question, for even
      supposing such an appeal safe,&mdash;which it was very far from being,&mdash;it
      would have reflected most disadvantageously on the O&rsquo;Reillys to have been
      mixed up in altercation with a man so much beneath themselves as Alexander
      MacDonough of &ldquo;The Tenement;&rdquo; for such, in slang phrase, did he designate
      his country residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now return from this long but indispensable digression to the
      subject which suggested it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So many questions were put, explanations demanded, doubts suggested, and
      advices thrown out to Forester that it was not until after a considerable
      lapse of time he was enabled to commence his description of the unknown
      traveller, nor even then was he suffered to proceed without interruption,
      a demand being made by MacDonough that the absent individual was entitled
      to counsel, who should look after his interests, and, if necessary,
      cross-examine the evidence. All this was done in that style of comic
      seriousness to which Forester was so little accustomed that, what with the
      effect of wine, heat, and noise, combined with the well-assumed gravity of
      the party, he really forgot the absurdity of the whole affair, and became
      as eager and attentive as though the event were one of deep importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at last decided that MacDonough should act as counsel for the
      unknown, and the company should vote separately, each writing down on a
      slip of paper their impression of the individual designated, the result
      being tested by the majority in favor of any one person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen of the jury,&rdquo; said the host, in a voice of deep solemnity, &ldquo;you
      will hear and well weigh the evidence before you touching this case, and
      decide with truth and conscience on its merits; so fill a bumper and let
      us begin. Make your statement, Captain Forester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sudden silence succeeding to the tumultuous uproar, the directed gaze
      of so many eager faces, and the evident attention with which his statement
      was awaited, conspired to make Forester nervous and uneasy; nor was it
      without something of an effort that he began the recital of his adventure
      at Kilbeggan. Warming as he proceeded, he told of the accident by which
      his acquaintance with the unknown traveller was opened, and at length,
      having given so much of preliminary, entered upon the description of the
      individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever Forester&rsquo;s own impression of the stranger, he soon felt how very
      difficult a task portrait-painting was, and how very unlike was his
      representation of the individual in question. The sure way to fail in any
      untried career is to suspect a failure; this he soon discovered, and cut
      short a most imperfect description by abruptly saying, &ldquo;If you guess him
      now, gentlemen, I acknowledge the merit is far more in <i>your</i>
      perspicuity than in <i>my</i> powers of description.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a few questions before you leave the table, sir,&rdquo; said MacDonough,
      addressing him with the mock sternness of a cross-examining barrister.
      &ldquo;You said the unknown was gifted with a most courteous and prepossessing
      manner: pray what is the exact meaning of your phrase? for we uncouth
      inhabitants of a remote region have very imperfect notions on such
      subjects. My friend Dan Mahon here would call any man agreeable who could
      drink fourteen tumblers, and not forget the whiskey in mixing the
      fifteenth; Tom Callaghan, on the other hand, would test his breeding by
      what he knew of a wether or a &lsquo;short-horn;&rsquo; Giles, my neighbor here, would
      ask, Did he lend you any money? and Mr. Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly would whisper a
      hope that he came of an old family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The leer by which these words were accompanied gave them an impertinence
      even greater than their simple signification; but however coarse the
      sarcasm, it suited well the excited tone of the party, who laughed loud
      and vociferously as he uttered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange as he was to the party, Forester saw that the allusion had a
      personal application, and was very far from relishing a pleasantry whose
      whole merit was its coarseness; he therefore answered in a tone of rather
      haughty import, &ldquo;The person I met, sir, was a gentleman; and the word, so
      far as I know, has an easy signification, at least to all who have had
      opportunities to learn it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt of that, Captain Forester,&rdquo; replied MacDonough; &ldquo;but if
      we divided the house on it here, some of us might differ about the
      definition. Your neighbor there, Mr. Beecham O&rsquo;Reilly, thinks his own
      countrymen very far down in the scale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A low fellow,&mdash;nobody pays attention to him,&rdquo; muttered young
      O&rsquo;Reilly in Forester&rsquo;s ear, as, with a cheek pale as death, he affected to
      seem totally indifferent to the continued insolence of his tormentor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Beecham O&rsquo;Reilly,&rdquo; interposed MacDonough, with a
      significant smile, &ldquo;but your observation was, I think, meant to apply to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man made no answer, but proceeded to fill his glass with claret,
      while his hand trembled so much that he spilled the wine about the table.
      Forester stared at him, expecting each instant to hear his reply to this
      appeal; but not a word escaped him, nor did he even look towards the
      quarter from which the taunt proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you so, sir?&rdquo; exclaimed MacDonough, with a triumphant
      laugh. &ldquo;There are various descriptions of gentlemen: some are contented
      with qualities of home growth, and satisfied to act, think, and deport
      themselves like their neighbors; others travel for this improvement, and
      bring back habits and customs that seem strange in their own country; now,
      I don&rsquo;t doubt but in England that young gentleman would be thought all
      that was spirited and honorable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to say to that, sir!&rdquo; replied Forester, sternly; &ldquo;but if
      you would like to hear the opinion my fellow-countrymen would have of
      yourself, I could perhaps favor you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, stop! where are you hurrying to? No more of this nonsense,&rdquo; cried
      the host, who had suddenly caught the last few words, while conversing
      with a person on his left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon most humbly, sir,&rdquo; said MacDonough, whose faced was
      flushed with passion, and whose lip trembled, notwithstanding all his
      efforts to seem calm and collected, &ldquo;but the gentleman was about to
      communicate a trait of English society. I know you misunderstood him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; said the host; &ldquo;what was it, Captain Forester? I believe I
      did not hear you quite accurately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very simple fact, sir,&rdquo; said Forester, coolly, &ldquo;and one that can
      scarcely astonish Mr. MacDonough to hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And which is&mdash;?&rdquo; said MacDonough, affecting a bland smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you &lsquo;d ask for a definition, if I employ a single word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this time,&rdquo; said MacDonough, still smiling in the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, sir, it would be affectation to do so; for though you may
      feel very natural doubts about what constitutes a gentleman, you ought to
      be pretty sure what makes a blackguard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words seemed to fall like a shell in the company; one burst of
      tumultuous uproar broke forth, voices in every tone and accent of
      eagerness and excitement, when suddenly the host cried out, &ldquo;Lock the
      doors; no man leaves the room till this matter is settled; there shall be
      no quarrelling beneath this roof so long as Bagenal Daly sits here for his
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The caution came too late&mdash;MacDonough was gone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. AN AFTER-DINNER STORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The unhappy event which so suddenly interrupted the conviviality of the
      party scarcely made a more than momentary impression. Altercations which
      ended most seriously were neither rare nor remarkable at the dinner-tables
      of the country gentlemen, and if the present instance caused an unusual
      interest, it was only because one of the parties was an Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Forester himself, his first burst of anger over, he forgot all in
      his astonishment that the host was not &ldquo;the Knight&rdquo; himself, but only his
      representative and friend, Bagenal Daly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Captain Forester,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I owe you an <i>amende</i> for the
      mystification I have practised upon you. You shall have it. Your
      travelling acquaintance at Kilbeggan was the &lsquo;Knight of Gwynne;&rsquo; and the
      few lines he sent through your hands contained an earnest desire that your
      stay here might be sufficiently prolonged to admit of his meeting you at
      his return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be extremely sorry,&rdquo; said Forester, in a low voice, &ldquo;if anything
      that has occurred to-night shall deprive me of that pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said Daly, with a significant nod of
      his head. &ldquo;Leave that to me.&rdquo; Then, raising his voice, he added: &ldquo;What do
      you say to that claret, Conolly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; replied a rosy-cheeked old squire in a hunting-dress,
      &ldquo;it &lsquo;s too old,&mdash;there&rsquo;s little spirit left in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true, Tom. Wine has its dotage, like the rest of us. All that the
      best can do is to keep longest; and, after all, we scarcely can complain
      of the vintage that has a taste of its once flavor at our age. It&rsquo;s a long
      time since we were schoolfellows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not an hour less than&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Tom,&mdash;no more of that. Of all scores to go back upon, that of
      years past is the saddest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said the hearty old squire, as he tossed off
      a bumper. &ldquo;I never remember riding better than I did to-day. Ask Beecham
      O&rsquo;Reilly there which of us was first over the double ditch at the red
      barn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, sir,&rdquo; said the young gentleman referred to, &ldquo;that I was on an
      English-bred mare, and she doesn&rsquo;t understand these fences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, she wasn&rsquo;t worse off, in that respect, than the man on her back,&rdquo;
       said old Conolly, with a hearty chuckle. &ldquo;If to look before you leap be
      wisdom, you ought to be the shrewdest fellow in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beecham, I believe, keeps a good place in Northamptonshire,&rdquo; said his
      father, half proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another argument in favor of the Union, I suppose,&rdquo; whispered a guest in
      Conolly&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; sighed the old squire, &ldquo;when I was a young man, we &lsquo;d have
      thought of bringing over a dromedary from Asia as soon as an English horse
      to cross the country with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick French was the only one I ever heard of backing a dromedary,&rdquo; said a
      fat old farmer-like man, from the end of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was that, Martin?&rdquo; said Daly, with a look that showed he either knew
      the story or anticipated something good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by all accounts, it &lsquo;s the devil to ride,&rdquo; resumed the old fellow;
      &ldquo;now it&rsquo;s the head down and the loins up, and then a roll to one side, and
      then to the other, and a twist in the small of your back, as if it were
      coming in two. Oh, by the good day! Dick gave me as bad as a stitch in the
      side just telling me about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where did he get his experience, Martin? I never heard of it before,&rdquo;
       said Daly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a fortnight in Egypt, sir,&rdquo; said the old farmer. &ldquo;He was in a
      frigate, or a man-of-war of one kind or another, off&mdash;the devil a one
      o&rsquo; me knows well where it was, but there was a consul there, a son of one
      of his father&rsquo;s tenants&mdash;indeed, ould French got him the place from
      the Government&mdash;and when he found out that Dick was on board the
      ship, what does he do but writes him an invitation to pass a week or ten
      days with him at his house, and that he &lsquo;d show him some sport. &lsquo;We &lsquo;ve
      elegant hunting,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;not foxes or hares, but a big bird, bigger nor
      a goose, they call&mdash;&lsquo;By my conscience, I &lsquo;ll forget my own name next,
      for I heard Dick tell the story at least twenty times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it an ostrich?&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; nor an oyster either, Mr. Conolly,&rdquo; said the old fellow, who thought
      the question was meant to quiz him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;T was an ibis, Martin,&rdquo; cried Daly,&mdash;&ldquo;an ibis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil a doubt of it,&mdash;that&rsquo;s the name. A crayture with legs as
      long as Mr. Beecham O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s, and a way of going&mdash;half-flying,
      half-walking&mdash;almost impossible to catch; and they hunt him on
      dromedaries. Dick liked the notion well, and as he was a favorite on
      board, he got lave for three days to go on shore and have his fun; though
      the captain said, at parting, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not many dromedaries you&rsquo;ll see, Dick,
      for the Pasha has them all up the country at this time.&rsquo; This was true
      enough; sorra a bit of a camel or dromedary could be seen for miles round.
      But however it was, the consul kept his word, and had one for Dick the
      next morning,&mdash;a great strapping baste, all covered with trappings of
      one kind or other; elegant shawls and little hearthrugs all over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The others were mounted on mules or asses, any way they could, and away
      they went to look after the goose&mdash;the &lsquo;ibis,&rsquo; I mean. Well, to be
      short with it, they came up with one on the bank of the river, and soon
      gave chase; he was a fine strong fellow, and well able to run. I wish you
      heard Dick tell this part of it; never was there such sport in the world,
      blazing away all together as fast as they could prime and load, at one
      time at the goose, more times at each other; the mules kicking, the asses
      braying, and Dick cantering about on his dromedary, upsetting every one
      near him, and shouting like mad. At last he pinned the goose up in a
      narrow corner among some old walls, and Dick thought he &lsquo;d have the brush;
      but sorra step the dromedary would stir; he spurred and kicked, and beat
      away with a stick as hard as he could, but it was all no good,&mdash;it
      was the carpets maybe, that saved him; for there he stood fast, just for
      all the world as if he was made of stone.
    </p>

      <img src="images/077.jpg" width="100%" alt="077 " />
    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick pulled out a pistol and fired a shot in his ear, but all to no use;
      he minded it no more than before. &lsquo;Bad luck to you for a baste,&rsquo; says
      Dick, &lsquo;what ails you at all&mdash;are you going to die on me? Get along
      now.&rsquo; The divil receave the step I &lsquo;ll go till I get some spirits and
      wather!&rsquo; says the dromedary, &lsquo;for I &lsquo;m clean smothered with them b&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;y
      blankets;&rsquo; and with them same words the head of the baste fell off, and
      Dick saw the consul&rsquo;s own man wiping the perspiration off his face, and
      blowing like a porpoise. &lsquo;How the divil the hind legs bears it I can&rsquo;t
      think,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;for I &lsquo;m nigh dead, though I had a taste of fresh air.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The murther was out, gentlemen, for ye see the consul could n&rsquo;t get a
      raal dromedary, and was obliged to make one out of a Christian and a black
      fellow he had for a cook, and sure enough in the beginning of the day Dick
      says he went like a clipper; &lsquo;twas doubling after the goose destroyed
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether the true tale had or had not been familiar to most of the company
      before, it produced the effect Bagenal Daly desired, by at first creating
      a hearty roar of laughter, and then, as seems the consequence in all cases
      of miraculous narrative, set several others upon recounting stories of
      equal credibility. Daly encouraged this new turn of conversation with all
      the art of one who knew how to lead men&rsquo;s thoughts into a particular
      channel without exciting suspicion of his intentions by either abruptness
      or over zeal: to any ordinary observer, indeed, he would have now appeared
      a mere enjoyer of the scene, and not the spirit who gave it guidance and
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way passed the hours long after midnight, when, one by one, the
      guests retired to their rooms; Forester remaining at the table in
      compliance with a signal which Daly had made him, until at length Hickman
      O&rsquo;Reilly stood up to go, the last of all, save Daly and the young
      guardsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing round the table, he leaned over Forester&rsquo;s chair, and in a low,
      cautious whisper, said, &ldquo;You have put down the greatest bully in this
      country, Captain Forester; do not spoil your victory by being drawn into a
      disreputable quarrel! Good night, gentlemen both,&rdquo; said he, aloud, and
      with a polite bow left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that he whispered?&rdquo; said Daly, as the door closed and they were
      left alone together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forester repeated the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I guessed why he sat so late; he sees the game clearly enough. You,
      sir, have taken up the glaive that was thrown down for his son&rsquo;s
      acceptance, and he knows the consequence&mdash;clever fellow that he is!
      Had you been less prompt, Beecham&rsquo;s poltroonery might have escaped notice;
      and even now, if you were to decline a meeting&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have no intention of doing any such thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I never supposed you had; but were you to be swayed by wrong
      counsels and do so, Master Beecham would be saved even yet. Well, well, I
      am sorry, Captain Forester, you should have met such a reception amongst
      us, and my friend Darcy will be deeply grieved at it. However, we have
      other occupation now than vain regret, so to bed as fast as you can, and
      to sleep; the morning is not very far off, and we shall have some one from
      MacDonough here by daybreak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a cordial shake-hands, like men who already knew and felt kindly
      towards each other, they separated for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Forester was thus sensible of the manliness and straightforward
      resolution that marked Bagenal Daly&rsquo;s character, he was very far from
      feeling satisfied with the position in which he found himself placed. A
      duel under any circumstances is scarcely an agreeable incident in one&rsquo;s
      life; but a meeting whose origin is at a drinking-bout, and where the
      antagonist is a noted fire-eater, and by that very reputation
      discreditable, is still a great aggravation of the evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      To have embroiled himself in a quarrel of this kind would, he well knew,
      greatly prejudice him in the estimation of his cold-tempered relative,
      Lord Castlereagh, who would not readily forgive an indiscretion that
      should mar his own political views. As he sat in his dressing-room
      revolving such unpleasant reflections, there came a gentle tap at the
      door; he had but time to say, &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; when Mr. Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you excuse this intrusion, Captain Forester?&rdquo; said he, with an
      accent in which the blandest courtesy was mingled with a well-affected
      cordiality; &ldquo;but I really could not lay my head on a pillow in
      tranquillity until I had seen and spoken to you in confidence. This
      foolish altercation&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pray don&rsquo;t let that give you a moment&rsquo;s uneasiness! I believe I
      understand the position the gentleman you allude to occupies in your
      country society: that license is accorded him, and freedoms taken with
      him, not habitually the case in the world at large.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right, your views are strictly accurate. MacDonough is a
      low fellow of very small fortune, no family,&mdash;indeed, what pretension
      he has to associate with the gentry I am unable to guess, nor would you
      have ever seen him under this roof had the Knight been at home; Mr. Daly,
      however, who, being an old schoolfellow and friend of Darcy&rsquo;s, does the
      honors here in his absence, is rather indiscriminate in his hospitalities.
      You may have remarked around the table some singular-looking guests,&mdash;in
      fact, he not only invites the whole hunting-field, but half the farmers
      over whose ground we &lsquo;ve ridden, and, were it not that they have sense and
      shame enough to see their own place with truer eyes, we should have an
      election mob here every day of the week; but this is not exactly the topic
      which led to my intruding upon you. I wished, in the first place, to rest
      assured that you had no intention of noticing the man&rsquo;s impertinence, or
      of accepting any provocation on his part; in fact, were he admissible to
      such a privilege, my son Beecham would have at once taken the whole upon
      himself, it being more properly his quarrel than yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forester, with all his efforts, was unable to repress a slight smile at
      these words. O&rsquo;Reilly noticed it, and colored up, while he added:
      &ldquo;Beecham, however, knew the impossibility of such a course,&mdash;in fact,
      Captain Forester, I may venture to say, without any danger of being
      misunderstood by you, that my son has imbibed more correct notions of the
      world and its habits at <i>your</i> side of St. George&rsquo;s Channel than
      could have fallen to him had his education been merely Irish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This compliment, if well meant, was scarcely very successful, for Forester
      bit his lip impatiently, but never made any answer. Whether O&rsquo;Reilly
      perceived the cause of this, or that, like a skilful painter, he knew when
      to take his brush off the canvas, he arose at once and said, &ldquo;I leave you,
      then, with a mind much relieved. I feared that a mistaken estimate of
      MacDonough&rsquo;s claims in society, and probably some hot-brained counsels of
      Mr. Bagenal Daly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite in error there; let me assure you, sir, his view of the
      matter is exactly my own,&rdquo; interrupted Forester, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted to hear it, and have now only one request: will you favor
      us with a few days&rsquo; visit at Mount O&rsquo;Reilly? I may say, without vanity,
      that my son is more likely to be a suitable companion to you than the
      company here may afford; we &lsquo;ve some good shooting and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must not suffer you to finish the catalogue of temptations,&rdquo; said
      Forester, smiling courteously; &ldquo;my hours are numbered already, and I must
      be back in Dublin within a few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beecham will be sorely disappointed; in fact, we came back here to-day
      for no other reason than to meet you at dinner. Daly told us of your
      arrival. May we hope to see you at another opportunity? are your
      engagements formed for Christmas yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so,&mdash;Dorsetshire, I think,&rdquo; muttered Forester, with a tone
      that plainly indicated a desire to cushion the subject at once; and Mr.
      O&rsquo;Reilly, with a ready tact, accepted the hint, and, wishing him a most
      cordial goodnight, departed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. A MESSAGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      While Forester slept soundly and without a dream, his long, light
      breathing scarce audible within the quiet chamber, a glance within the
      room of Bagenal Daly would have shown that, whatever the consequences of
      the past night&rsquo;s troubles, he, at least, was not likely to be taken
      unprepared. On the table in the middle of the apartment two wax candles
      burned, two others, as yet unlighted, stood ready on the chimney-piece, a
      pistol case lay open, displaying the weapons, whose trim and orderly
      appearance denoted recent care, a fact attested by certain cloths and
      flannels which lay about; a mould for bullets, and about a dozen
      newly-cast balls most carefully filed and rubbed smooth with sandpaper,
      were flanked by a small case of surgical instruments, with an ample supply
      of lint and ligatures such as are used to secure bleeding vessels, in the
      use of which few unprofessional persons could vie with Bagenal Daly. A few
      sheets of paper lay also there, on which appeared some recent writing; and
      in a large, deep armchair, ready dressed for the day, sat Daly himself,
      sound asleep; one arm hung listlessly over the chair, the other was
      supported in the breast of his waistcoat. The strong, stern features,
      unrelaxed by repose, had the same impassive expression of cold defiance as
      when awake, and if his lips muttered, the accents were not less determined
      and firm than in his moments of self-possession. He awoke from time to
      time and looked at his watch, and once threw open the sash, and held out
      his hand to ascertain if it were raining; but these interruptions did not
      interfere with his rest, for, the minute after, he slept as soundly as
      before. Nor was he the only one within that house who counted the hours
      thus anxiously. A lantern in the stable beamed brightly, showing three
      horses ready saddled, the bridles on the neck of each, and ready at a
      moment&rsquo;s notice to be bitted; while pacing slowly to and fro, like a
      sentinel on his post, was the tall figure of Sandy M&rsquo;Grane, wrapped in a
      long cloth cloak, and his head covered by a cap, whose shape and material
      spoke of a far-off land and wild companionship; for it was the skin of a
      black fox, and the workmanship the product of a squaw&rsquo;s fair fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sandy&rsquo;s patrol was occasionally extended to the gateway, where he usually
      halted for a few seconds to listen, and then resumed his path as leisurely
      as before. At last, he remained somewhat longer at the gate, and bent his
      head more cautiously to hear; then, noiselessly unbarring and unlocking
      the door, he leaned out. To an ear less practised than his own the silence
      would have been complete. Not so with Sandy, whose perceptions had
      received the last finish of an Indian education. He retired hastily, and,
      approaching that part of the court beneath his master&rsquo;s window, gave a
      long, low whistle. The next moment the casement was opened, and Daly&rsquo;s
      head appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What now, Sandy? It is but a quarter past five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be so; but there &lsquo;s a horse coming fast up the lower road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen again, and try if you hear it still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sandy did so, and was back in a few moments. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s crossing the bridge at
      &lsquo;the elms&rsquo; now, and will be here in less than three minutes more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watch the gate, then&mdash;let there be no noise&mdash;and come up by the
      back stairs.&rdquo; With these words Daly closed the sash, and Sandy returned to
      his post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere many minutes elapsed, the door of Mr. Daly&rsquo;s chamber was opened, and
      Sandy announced Major Hackett of Brough. As Bagenal Daly rose to meet him,
      an expression of more than ordinary sternness was stamped upon his bold
      features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your servant informed me that I should find you in readiness to receive
      me, Mr. Bagenal Daly,&rdquo; said the Major, a coarse-looking, carbuncled-face
      man of about forty; &ldquo;but perhaps the object of my visit would be better
      accomplished if I could have a few minutes&rsquo; conversation with a Captain
      Forester who is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can show me no sufficient cause to the contrary, sir,&rdquo; replied
      Daly, proudly, &ldquo;I shall act for him on this occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; said Hackett, smiling dubiously. &ldquo;The business I came upon
      induced me to suspect that, at your time of life&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, sir,&mdash;finish your speech,&rdquo; said Daly, with&rsquo; a fixed and
      steady stare which, very far from reassuring, seemed only to increase the
      Major&rsquo;s confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, Mr. Daly,&rdquo; resumed he, more hurriedly, &ldquo;I have nothing
      whatever to do with that. My duty is to convey a message from Mr.
      Alexander MacDonough to a gentleman named Forester, here. If you will
      accept the proposition, and assist in the necessary arrangements&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are ready, sir,&mdash;quite ready. One of the consequences of
      admitting dubious acquaintances to the intimacy of the table is such a
      case as the present. I was guilty of one fault in this respect, but I
      shall show you I was not unprepared for what might follow it.&rdquo; And as he
      spoke he threw open the window and called out, &ldquo;Sandy! awaken Captain
      Forester. I suppose you are ready, Major Hackett, with your friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Mr. MacDonough expects us at Cluan Point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And bridle the horses, Sandy,&rdquo; continued Daly, speaking from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I conclude, from what I see,&rdquo; said Hackett, &ldquo;that your friend is not only
      decided against offering an apology for his offence, but desirous of a
      meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said so, sir?&mdash;or what right have you to suppose that any
      gentleman of good family and good prospects should indulge such an
      unnatural caprice as to wish to risk character and life in a quarrel with
      Mr. Alexander MacDonough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Circumstanced as that gentleman is at this moment, your observations are
      unsuitable, sir,&rdquo; replied the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they are,&rdquo; said Daly, hastily; &ldquo;or, rather, so they would have been,
      if not provoked by your remark. But, hang me! if I think it signifies
      much; if it were not that some of our country neighbors were good-natured
      enough to treat this same Mr. MacDonough on terms of equality before, I &lsquo;d
      have advised Captain Forester not to mind him. <i>My</i> maxim is, there
      are always low fellows enough to shoot one another, and never come
      trespassing among the manors of their betters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must confess myself unprepared, sir, to hear language like this,&rdquo; said
      Hackett, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a whit more than I feel at seeing myself negotiating a meeting with a
      man turned out of the army with disgrace,&rdquo; said Daly, as his face grew
      purple with anger. &ldquo;Were it not that I would not risk a hint of dishonor
      on this young Englishman&rsquo;s fame, I &lsquo;d never interchange three words with
      Major Hackett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall answer for this, sir, and speedily too, by G&mdash;&mdash;d!&rdquo;
       said Hackett, moving towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daly burst into an insolent laugh, and said, &ldquo;Your friend waits us at
      Cluan?&rdquo; The other bowed. &ldquo;Well, within an hour we&rsquo;ll be there also,&rdquo;
       continued the old man; and Hackett retired without adding a syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We &lsquo;ve about five miles to ride, Captain Forester,&rdquo; said Daly, as they
      issued forth beneath the deeply arched gate of the abbey; &ldquo;but the road is
      a mountain one, and will not admit of fast riding. A fine old place it
      is,&rdquo; said he, as, halting his horse, he bestowed a gaze of admiration on
      the venerable building, now dimly visible in the gray of the breaking
      dawn. &ldquo;The pious founders little dreamt of men leaving its portals on such
      an errand as ours.&rdquo; Then, suddenly, with a changed voice, he added, &ldquo;Men
      are the same in every age and country; what our ancestors did in steel
      breastplates, we do now in broadcloth; the law, as they call it, must
      always be subservient to human passions, and the judge and the jury come
      too late, since their function is penalty, and not prevention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely you do not think the world was better in the times when might
      was right?&rdquo; said Forester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The system worked better than we suspect,&rdquo; said the old man, gravely;
      &ldquo;there was such a thing as public opinion among men in those days,
      although its exponents were neither pamphlets nor scurrilous newspapers.
      The unjust and the cruel were held in reprobation, and the good and the
      charitable had a fame as pure, although their deeds were not trumpeted
      aloud or graven on marble. Believe me, sir, we are not by any means so
      much wiser or better than those who went before us, and even if we were
      both, we certainly are not happier. This eternal warfare, this hand to
      hand and foot to foot straggle for rank, apd wealth, and power, that goes
      on amongst us now, had no existence then, when a man&rsquo;s destiny was carved
      out for him, and he was all but powerless to alter or control it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That alone was no small evil,&rdquo; said Forester, interrupting him; &ldquo;the
      humbly born and the lowly were debarred from all the prizes of life, no
      matter how great their deserts or how shining their abilities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every rank and class had wherewithal to supply its own requirements,&rdquo;
       answered Daly, proudly, &ldquo;and the menial had more time to indulge affection
      for his master, when removed from the temptation to rival him. That strong
      bond of attachment has all but disappeared from amongst us.&rdquo; As he spoke,
      he turned in his saddle and called out, &ldquo;Can we cross the sands now, or is
      the tide making, Sandy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no just making yet,&rdquo; said the servant, cautiously; &ldquo;but when the
      breakers are so heavy off the Point, it&rsquo;s aye safer to keep the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The road be it, then,&rdquo; muttered Daly to himself; &ldquo;men never are so chary
      of life as when about to risk it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The observation, although not intended, reached Forester&rsquo;s ears, and he
      smiled and said, &ldquo;Naturally enough, perhaps we ought not to be too
      exacting with fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daly turned suddenly round, and, after a brief pause, asked, &ldquo;What skill
      have you with the pistol?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the mark is a shilling I can hit it, three times out of four, at
      twenty paces; but I never fired at a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That does make a difference,&rdquo; said Daly, musingly; &ldquo;nothing short of an
      arrant coward could look calmly on a fellow-creature while he pointed a
      loaded pistol at his heart. A brave man will always have self-possession
      enough to feel the misery of his position. Had the feat been one of
      vengeance, and not of love, Tell had never hit the apple, sir. But there,&mdash;is
      not that a fire yonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see a red glare through the mist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fire on Cluan Point,&rdquo; said Sandy, riding up to his master&rsquo;s
      side; &ldquo;I trow it&rsquo;s a signal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! meant to quicken us, perhaps; some fear of being surprised,&rdquo; said
      Daly, hastily; &ldquo;let us move on faster.&rdquo; And they spurred their horses to a
      sharp trot as they descended the gentle slope, which, projecting far out
      to sea, formed the promontory of Cluan.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this moment the glorious panorama of Clue Bay broke forth before
      Forester&rsquo;s astonished eyes. He looked with rapture on that spacious sheet
      of water, which, in all the majesty of the great ocean, came heaving and
      swelling against the rocky coast, or pouring its flood of foam through the
      narrow channels between the islands. Of these, the diversity seemed
      endless, some rich and verdant, teeming with abundance and dotted with
      cottages; others, less fertile, were covered with sheep or goats; while
      some, rugged and barren, frowned gloomily amid the watery waste, and one,
      far out to sea, a bold and lofty cliff, showed a faint twinkling star upon
      its side, the light for the homeward-bound ships over the Atlantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Clare Island yonder,&rdquo; said Bagenal Daly, as he observed the
      direction of Forester&rsquo;s gaze; &ldquo;I must show you the great cliff there. What
      say you if we go to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo; repeated Forester, smiling faintly; &ldquo;perhaps so.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      When speaking of Gwynne Abbey to our readers, we omitted to mention a very
      beautiful portion of the structure,&mdash;a small building which adjoined
      the chapel, and went, for some reason or other, by name of the
      &ldquo;Sub-Prior&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; More recent in date than the other parts of the
      abbey, it seemed as if here the architect had expended his skill in
      showing of how much ornament and decoration the Gothic was capable. The
      stone selected was of that pinkish hue that is seen in many of the
      cathedrals in the North of England,&mdash;a material peculiarly favorable
      to the labors of the chisel, and when protected from the rude influence of
      weather possessing qualities of great endurance. This building was
      surrounded on three sides by a flower-garden, which descended by
      successive terraces to the edge of a small river pursuing its course to
      the sea, into which it emerged about a mile distant. A very unmindful
      observer would have been struck at once with the aspect of greater care
      and cultivation bestowed here than on other portions of the abbey grounds.
      The trim and orderly appearance of everything, from the flowering shrubs
      that mingled their blossoms with the rich tracery of the architraves, to
      the bright gravel of the walks, denoted attention, while flowers of rare
      beauty, and plants of foreign growth, were seen blending their odors with
      the wild heaths that shed their perfume from the mountain side. The
      brilliant beauty of the spot was, indeed, heightened by the wild and
      rugged grandeur of the scene, like a diamond glittering brighter amid the
      dark dross of the mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the side nearest to the bay, and with a view extending to the far-off
      Island of Achill, an apartment opened by three large windows, the upper
      compartments of which exhibited armorial bearings in stained glass. If the
      view without presented a scene of the most grand and varied loveliness,
      within this chamber art seemed to have vied in presenting objects the most
      strange and beautiful. It was furnished in all the gorgeous taste of the
      time of Louis XV. The ceiling, a deep mass of carving relieved by gold,
      presented masses of fruit and flowers fantastically interwoven, and
      hanging, as though suspended, above the head. The walls were covered with
      cabinet pictures of great price, the very frames objects of wonder and
      admiration. Large vases of Dresden and Sèvres porcelain stood on brackets
      of massive silver, and one great cabinet of ebony, inlaid with gold and
      tortoiseshell, displayed an inscription that showed it was a present from
      the great Louis XIV. himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not, however, to linger over the objects of rare and costly
      excellence which here abounded that we have conducted our reader to this
      chamber, and whither we would beg of him to accompany us about two hours
      later than the events we have narrated in our last chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a breakfast-table whose equipage was, in price and elegance, in exact
      keeping with all around, were two ladies. The elder of the two was
      advanced in life, and although her hair was perfectly white, her regular
      features and finely pencilled brow bore, even yet, great marks of beauty.
      If the expression of the face was haughty, it was so without anything of
      severity; it was a look of pride that denoted rather a conscious sense of
      position and its duties, than any selfish assumption of personal
      importance. Habitual delicacy of health contributed to strengthen this
      expression, lending to it a character which, to an incautious observer,
      might convey the notion of weariness or ennui. The tones of her voice were
      low and measured, and perfectly devoid of any peculiar accent. If to those
      more familiar with the cordial familiarity of Irish manner, Lady Eleanor
      Darcy might seem cold and frigid, such as knew more of the world at large,
      and were more conversant with the general habits of society, could detect,
      through all the seeming impassive-ness of her air, that desire to please,
      that anxiety to make a favorable impression, which marked the character of
      one who in early life had been the beauty of her circle. Even now, as she
      lay back indolently within the deep recess of a cushioned chair, her
      attitude evinced a gracefulness and ease which long habit seemed to have
      identified with her nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the opposite side of the table, and busy in the preparation of the
      breakfast, stood a young girl whose age could not have been more than
      eighteen. So striking was the resemblance between them that the least
      acute of physiognomists must have pronounced her the daughter. She was
      dressed with remarkable simplicity; but not all the absence of ornament
      could detract from the first impression her appearance conveyed, that she
      was one of birth and station. Her beauty was of that character which,
      although attributed peculiarly to the Celtic race, seems strangely enough
      to present its most striking examples among the Anglo-Irish. Rich auburn
      hair, the color varying from dark brown to a deep golden hue as the light
      falls more or less strongly on it, was braided over a brow of classic
      beauty; her eyes were of blue, that deep color which, in speaking or in
      moments of excitement, looks like dark hazel or even black; these were
      fringed with long dark lashes which habitually hung heavily over the eyes,
      giving them a character of sleepy, almost indolent, beauty. The rest of
      her features, in unison with these, were of that Greek mould which our
      historians attribute to the Phoenician origin of our people,&mdash;a
      character by no means rare to be seen to this day among the peasantry. If
      the mild and gentle indications of womanly delicacy were told in every
      lineament of her face, there were traits of decision and determination
      when she spoke not less evident. From her mother she inherited the placid
      tenderness of English manner, while from her father her nature imbibed the
      joyous animation and buoyant light-heartedness of the Irish character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there are but two letters, Mamma,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;in the bag this
      morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But two,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor; &ldquo;one of them from Lionel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, from Lionel!&rdquo; cried the young girl, eagerly; &ldquo;let me see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read this first,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, as she handed across the table a
      letter bearing a large seal impressed with an Earl&rsquo;s coronet; &ldquo;if I
      mistake not very much, Helen, that&rsquo;s my cousin Lord Netherby&rsquo;s writing;
      but what eventful circumstance could have caused his affectionate
      remembrance of me, after something nigh twenty years&rsquo; silence, is beyond
      my power of divination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen Darcy well knew that the theme on which her mother now touched was
      the sorest subject on her mind, and, however anxiously she might, under
      other circumstances, have pressed for a sight of her brother&rsquo;s letter, she
      controlled all appearance of the wish, and opened the other without
      speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is dated from Carlton House, Mamma, the 2d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in waiting, I suppose,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, calmly; and Helen began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My dear cousin&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! so he remembers the relationship at least,&rdquo; muttered the old lady to
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My dear cousin, it would be a sad abuse of the small space a letter
      affords, to inquire into the cause of our long silence; faults on both
      sides might explain much of it. I was never a brilliant correspondent, you
      were always an indolent one; if I wrote stupid letters, you sent me very
      brief answers; and if you at last grew weary of giving gold for brass, I
      can scarcely reproach you for stopping the exchange. Still, at the risk of
      remaining unanswered, once more&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is intolerable,&rdquo; broke in Lady Eleanor; &ldquo;he never replied to the
      letter in which I asked him to be your godfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Still, at the risk of remaining unanswered, once more I must throw
      myself on your mercy. In the selfishness of age,&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget, my
      dear coz, I am eleven years your senior,&mdash;in the selfishness of age&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady smiled dubiously at these words, and Helen read on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I desire to draw closer around me those ties of kindred and family
      which, however we may affect to think lightly of, all our experiences in
      life tend to strengthen and support. Yes, my dear Eleanor, we are the only
      two remaining of all those light-hearted boys and bright-eyed girls that
      once played upon the terrace at Netherby. Poor Harry, your old sweetheart
      at Eton, fell at Mysore. Dudley, with ability for anything, would not wait
      patiently for the crowning honors of his career, took a judgeship in
      Madras, and he, too, sleeps in the land of the stranger! And our sweet
      Catherine! your only rival amongst us, how short-lived was her triumph!&mdash;for
      so the world called her marriage with the Margrave: she died of a broken
      heart at two-and-twenty! I know not why I have called up these sad
      memories, except it be in the hope that, as desolation deals heavily
      around us, we may draw more closely to each other.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Eleanor concealed her face with her handkerchief, and Helen, who had
      gradually dropped her voice as she read, stopped altogether at these
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read on, dear,&rdquo; said the old lady, in a tone whose firmness was slightly
      shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A heart more worldly than yours, my dear Eleanor, would exclaim that the
      <i>parti</i> was unequal,&mdash;that I, grown old and childless, with few
      friends left, and no ambitions to strive for, stood in far more need of <i>your</i>
      affectionate regard, than you, blessed with every tie to existence, did of
      <i>mine</i>; and the verdict would be a just one, for, by the law of that
      Nemesis we all feel more or less, even in this world, <i>you</i>, whom we
      deemed rash and imprudent, have alone amongst us secured the prize of that
      happiness we each sought by such different paths.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A heavy sigh that broke from her mother made Helen cease reading, but at a
      motion of her hand she resumed: &ldquo;&lsquo;For all our sakes, then, my dear cousin,
      only remember so much of the past as brings back pleasant memories. Make
      my peace with your kind-hearted husband. If I can forgive <i>him</i> all
      the pangs of jealousy he inflicted on <i>me, he</i> may well pardon any
      slight transgressions on <i>my</i> part, and Lionel, too.&mdash;But,
      first, tell me how have I offended my young kinsman? I have twice
      endeavored to make his acquaintance, but in vain. Two very cold and
      chilling answers to my invitations to Netherby are all I have been able to
      obtain from him: the first was a plea of duty, which I could easily have
      arranged; but the second note was too plain to be mistaken: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll none of
      you,&rdquo; was the tone of every line of it. But I will not be so easily
      repulsed: I am determined to know him, and, more still, determined that he
      shall know me. If you knew, my dear Eleanor, how proudly my heart beat at
      hearing his Royal Highness speak of him!&mdash;he had seen him at Hounslow
      at a review. It was a slight incident, but I am certain your son never
      told it, and so I must. Lionel, in passing with his company, forgot to
      lower the regimental flag before the Prince, on which Lord Maxwell, the
      colonel, the most passionate man in England, rode up, and said something
      in an angry tone. &ldquo;I beg pardon, Colonel,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;if I
      interfere with the details of duty, but I have remarked that young officer
      before, and, trust me, he &lsquo;ll come off &lsquo;with flying colors,&rsquo; on more
      occasions than the present.&rdquo; The <i>mot</i> was slight, but the flattery
      was perfect; indeed, there is not another man in the kingdom can compete
      with his Royal Highness on this ground. Fascination is the only word that
      can express the charm of his manner. To bring Lionel more particularly
      under the Prince&rsquo;s notice, has long been a favorite scheme of mine; and I
      may say, without arrogance, that my opportunities are not inferior to most
      men&rsquo;s in this respect; I am an old courtier now,&mdash;no small boast for
      one who still retains his share of favor. If the son have any of his
      father&rsquo;s gifts, his success with the Prince is certain. The manner of the
      highly-bred Irish gentleman has been already pronounced by his Royal
      Highness as the type of what manner should be, and, with your assistance,
      I have little doubt of seeing Lionel appointed on the staff, here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Now, I must hazard my reputation a little, and ask what is the name of
      your second boy, and what is he doing?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen burst into a fit of laughter at these words, nor could Lady
      Eleanor&rsquo;s chagrin prevent her joining in the emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, he shall certainly have an answer to,&rdquo; said the old lady,
      recovering her self-possession and her pride; &ldquo;he shall hear that my
      second boy is called Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, Mamma, is it not very kind of him to remember even so much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember even more, Helen,&rdquo; interrupted Lady Eleanor; &ldquo;and no great
      kindness in the act either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I read all the possible and impossible chances of pushing my
      fortune in the Army or Navy, Mamma?&rdquo; said Helen, archly, &ldquo;for I see that
      his Lordship is most profuse in offers for my advancement,&mdash;nay, if I
      have a clerical vocation, here is a living actually waiting my
      acceptance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us rather look for something that may explain the riddle, my dear,&rdquo;
       said Lady Eleanor, taking the letter in her own hand, while she lightly
      skimmed over the last page. &ldquo;No, I can find no clew to it here&mdash;Stay,
      what have we in this corner?&mdash;&lsquo;Politically speaking, there is no news
      here; indeed, in that respect, <i>your</i> side of the Channel engrosses
      all the interest; the great question of the &ldquo;Union&rdquo; still occupies all
      attention. Virtually, <i>we</i> know the ministry have the majority, but
      there will be still a very respectable fight, to amuse the world withal.
      How does the Knight vote? With us, I hope and trust, for although I may
      tell you, in confidence, the result is certain, his support would be very
      grateful to the Government, and, while he himself can afford to smile at
      ministerial flatteries, Lionel is a young fellow whom rapid promotion
      would well become, and who would speedily distinguish himself, if the
      occasion were favorable. At all events, let the Knight not vote <i>against</i>
      the minister; this would be a crime never to be forgiven, and personally
      offensive to his Royal Highness; and I trust Darcy is too good a sportsman
      to prefer riding the last horse, even should he not wish to mount the
      winner.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the letter concluded, amid protestations of regard most
      affectionately worded, and warm wishes for a renewal of intimacy, only to
      cease with life. Across this was written, with a different ink, and in a
      hurried hand: &ldquo;I have this moment seen Mr. Pitt; the Knight&rsquo;s vote is very
      important. He may make any terms he pleases,&mdash;Pitt spoke of a
      peerage; but I suppose that would not be thought advisable. Let me hear <i>your</i>
      opinion. Lionel has been gazetted to a company this morning, <i>en
      attendant</i> better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Eleanor, who had read these last lines to herself, here laid down the
      letter without speaking, while the slight flush of her cheek and the
      increased brilliancy of her eyes showed that her feelings were deeply and
      powerfully excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mamma, have you found the solution to this mystery?&rdquo; said Helen, as
      she gazed with affectionate solicitude on her mother&rsquo;s features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How unchangeable a thing is nature!&rdquo; muttered Lady Eleanor,
      unconsciously, aloud; &ldquo;that boy was a crafty tuft-hunter at Eton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of whom are you speaking, Mamma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Netherby, my dear, who would seem to have cultivated his natural
      gift with great success; but,&rdquo; added she, after a pause, and in a voice
      scarcely above a whisper, &ldquo;I am scarcely as easy a dupe now as when he
      persuaded me to take ash-berries in exchange for cherries. Let us hear
      what Lionel says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As usual, Mamma, four lines in each page, and the last a blank,&rdquo; said
      Helen, laughing:&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear mother, what blandishments have you been
      throwing over the War Office? They have just given me my company, which,
      by the ordinary rules of the service, I had no pretension to hope for,
      these five years to come! Our colonel, too, a perfect Tartar, overwhelms
      me with civilities, and promises me a leave of absence on the first
      vacancy. Have you seen Forester, of ours? and how do you like him? A
      little cold or so at first, but <i>you</i> will not dislike that. His
      riding will please my father. Get him to sing, if you can; his taste and
      voice are both first-rate. Your worthy relative, Lord Netherby, bores me
      with invitations to his houses, town and country. I say &ldquo;No;&rdquo; but he won&rsquo;t
      be denied. Was he not rude, or indifferent, or something or other, once
      upon a time, to the ancient house of Darcy? Give me the <i>consigne</i>, I
      pray you, for I hear he has the best cock-shooting in England; and let my
      virtue, if possible, be rewarded by a little indulgence. Tell Helen they
      are all giving up powder here, and wear their hair as she does; but not
      one of them half as good-looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours, as ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      Lionel Darcy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hounslow, January 1st, 1800&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that Sullivan, there?&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, as her daughter finished the
      reading of this brief epistle. &ldquo;What does he mean by staring so at the
      window? The old man seems to have lost his senses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ochone arie! ochone! ochone!&rdquo; cried Tate, wringing his hands with the
      gestures of violent grief, as he moved up and down before the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened, Tate?&rdquo; said Helen, as she threw open the sash to
      address him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ochone! he&rsquo;s kilt&mdash;he&rsquo;s murthered&mdash;cut down like a daisy in a
      May morning. And he, the iligant, fine young man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom do you mean? Speak plainly, Sullivan,&rdquo; said the commanding voice of
      Lady Eleanor. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis the young officer from England, my lady, that came down the night
      before last to see the master. Oh, murther! murther! if his honor was
      here, the sorra bit of this grief we &lsquo;d have to-day&mdash;ochone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go on,&rdquo; said his mistress, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he came down for joy, &lsquo;t is sorrow he supped for it,&rsquo; the young
      crayture! They soon finished him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once for all, sir, speak out plainly, and say what has occurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Bagenal Daly done it all, my lady,&mdash;divil a one of me cares
      who hears me say it. He&rsquo;s a cruel man, ould as he is. He made him fight a
      duel, the darling young man,&mdash;the &lsquo;moral&rsquo; of Master Lionel himself;
      and now he&rsquo;s kilt&mdash;ochone! ochone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can this dreadful story be true, Helen?&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, as the faint
      color left her features. &ldquo;Call Margaret; or, stay&mdash;Sullivan, is Mr.
      Daly here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he is, never fear him. He&rsquo;s looking at his morning&rsquo;s work&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      in the room where they carried the corpse; and the fine corpse it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go tell Mr. Daly that Lady Eleanor desires to see him at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, and lose no time, Tate,&rdquo; said Helen, as, almost fainting with terror,
      she half pushed the old man on his errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother and daughter sat silently gazing on each other for several
      minutes, terror and dismay depicted in the face of each, nor were they
      conscious of the lapse of time, when the door opening presented Mr.
      Bagenal Daly before them. He was dressed in his usual suit of dark brown,
      and with all his accustomed neatness. His long cravat, which, edged with
      deep lace, hung negligently over his waistcoat, was spotless in color and
      accurate in every fold, while his massive features were devoid of the
      slightest signs of emotion or excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant Lady Eleanor was deceived by all these evidences of
      tranquillity, but a glance at old Tate&rsquo;s face, as he stood near the door,
      assured her that from such signs she had nothing to hope. Twice had Mr.
      Bagenal Daly performed his courteous salutations, which, in the etiquette
      of a past time, he made separately to each lady, and still Lady Eleanor
      had not summoned courage to address him. At last he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I been mistaken, and must I apologize for a visit at an hour so
      unseemly? But I heard that your Ladyship wished to see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true, Mr. Daly,&rdquo; interrupted Lady Eleanor, her habitual tact
      supplying a courage her heart was far from feeling. &ldquo;Will you be seated?
      Leave the room, Sullivan. My daughter and I,&rdquo; continued she, speaking with
      increased rapidity, to cover the emotion of the moment, &ldquo;have just heard
      something of a dreadful event which is said to have occurred this morning.
      Old Sullivan so often exaggerates that we indulge the hope that there may
      be little or no foundation for the story. Is it true, sir, there has been
      a duel fought near this?&rdquo; Her voice grew fainter as she spoke, and at last
      became a mere whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam,&rdquo; replied Daly, with an air of perfect calmness. &ldquo;Two
      gentlemen met this morning at Cluan Point, and both were wounded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither of them killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wounded, madam,&rdquo; reiterated Daly, as if correcting a misconstruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the wounds deemed dangerous, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. MacDonough&rsquo;s, madam, is not so. The inconvenience of using his left
      hand on any similar occasion, in future, will be probably the extent of
      the mishap. The other gentleman has not been equally fortunate,&mdash;his
      life is in peril.&rdquo; Mr. Daly paused for a second, and then, perceiving that
      Lady Eleanor still awaited a further explanation, added, with gravity,
      &ldquo;When taking his position on the ground, madam, instead of standing
      half-front, as I took pains to point out to him, Captain Forester&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forester!&mdash;is that his name, sir?&rdquo; interrupted Helen, as, in a hand
      trembling with terror, she held out Lionel&rsquo;s letter towards her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend of my son&rsquo;s,&mdash;is he in the same regiment with Lionel?&rdquo;
       asked Lady Eleanor, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daly bowed, and answered, &ldquo;The same, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A low, faint sigh broke from Lady Eleanor, and, covering her eyes with her
      hand, she sat for some moments without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has any one seen him, sir?&rdquo; asked Helen, suddenly, and in a voice that
      showed energy of character had the mastery over every feeling of grief,&mdash;&ldquo;is
      there a surgeon with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss Darcy,&rdquo; said Daly, with a certain haughtiness of manner. &ldquo;I
      believe, however, that, although not a professional person, my knowledge
      of a gunshot wound is scarcely inferior to most men&rsquo;s. I have sent in two
      directions for a surgeon; meanwhile, with my servant&rsquo;s aid, I have
      succeeded in extracting the ball&mdash;I beg pardon, ladies, I think I
      heard the noise of wheels; it is probably the doctor.&rdquo; And, with a deep
      bow and a measured step, Mr. Bagenal Daly withdrew, leaving Lady Eleanor
      and her daughter speechless, between grief and terror.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. THE &ldquo;HEAD&rdquo; OF A FAMILY
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Bagenal Daly reached the courtyard, he was disappointed at finding
      that, instead of the surgeon whose arrival was so anxiously looked for,
      the visitor was no other than old Dr. Hickman, the father of Hickman
      O&rsquo;Reilly, M. P. for the county, and grandfather of that very promising
      young gentleman slightly presented to our reader in an early chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the acorn be a very humble origin for the stately oak of the forest,
      assuredly Peter Hickman, formerly of Loughrea, &ldquo;Apothecary and Surgeon,&rdquo;
       was the most unpretending source for the high and mighty house of
      O&rsquo;Reilly. More strictly speaking, the process was only a &ldquo;graft,&rdquo; and it
      is but justice to him to say, that of this fact no one was more thoroughly
      convinced than old Peter himself. Industry and thrift had combined to
      render him tolerably well off in the world, when the death of a brother
      who had sought his fortunes in the East&mdash;when fortunes were to be
      found in that region&mdash;put him in possession of something above two
      hundred thousand pounds. Even before this event, he had been known as a
      shrewd contriver of small speculations, a safe investor of little capital,
      was conversant, from the habits of his professional life, with the private
      circumstances of every family of the country where money was wanting, and
      where repayment was sure; the very temperament of his patients suggested
      to him the knowledge by which he guided his operations, and he could bring
      his skill as a medical man into his service, and study his creditors with
      the eye of a physiologist. When this great accession of wealth so suddenly
      occurred, far from communicating his good fortune to his friends and
      neighbors, he merely gave out that poor Tom had left him &ldquo;his little
      savings,&rdquo; &ldquo;though God knows, in that faraway country, if he&rsquo;d ever see any
      of it.&rdquo; His guarded caution on the subject, and the steady persistence
      with which he maintained his former mode of life, gave credence to the
      story, and the utmost estimate of his wealth would not have gone beyond
      being a snug old fellow &ldquo;that might give up his business any day.&rdquo; This
      was, however, the very last thing in his thoughts; the title of &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo;
       so courteously bestowed in Ireland on the humbler walks of medicine, was a
      &ldquo;letter of marque&rdquo; enabling him to cruise in latitudes otherwise
      inaccessible. Any moneyed embarrassment of the country gentry, any severe
      pressure to be averted by an opportune loan or the sale of landed
      property, was speedily made available by him as a call to see whether &ldquo;the
      cough was easier;&rdquo; or &ldquo;how was the gouty ankle;&rdquo; if the &ldquo;mistress was
      getting better of the nerves,&rdquo; &ldquo;and the children gaining strength by the
      camomile.&rdquo; And in this way he made one species of gain subservient to
      another, while his character for kindness and benevolence was the theme of
      the whole neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several years long he pursued this course without deviating, and in
      that space had become the owner of estated property to a very great
      extent, not only in his own, but in three neighboring counties. How much
      longer he might have persisted in growing rich by stealth it is difficult
      to say, when accident compelled him to change his <i>tactique</i>. A very
      large property had been twice put up for sale in the county Mayo, under
      the will of its late owner, the trustees being empowered to make a great
      reduction in the price to any purchaser of the whole,&mdash;a condition
      which, from the great value of the estates, seemed of little avail, no
      single individual being supposed able to make such a purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, and as a final effort to comply with the wishes of the testator,
      the estate was offered at ten thousand pounds below the original demand,
      when a bidder made his appearance, the offer was accepted, and the
      apothecary of Lough-rea became the owner of one of the most flourishing
      properties of the West, with influence sufficient to return a member for
      the county.
    </p>
    <p>
      The murder was now out, and the next act was to build a handsome but
      unpretentious dwelling-house on a part of the estate, to which he removed
      with his son, a widower with one child. The ancient family of O&rsquo;Reilly had
      been the owners of the property, and the name was still retained to grace
      the new demesne, which was called Mount O&rsquo;Reilly, while Tom Hickman became
      Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly, under the plea of some relationship to the defunct,&mdash;a
      point which gained little credence in the county, and drew from Bagenal
      Daly the remark &ldquo;that he trusted that they had a better title to the acres
      than the arms of the O&rsquo;Reillys.&rdquo; When old Peter had made this great
      spring, he would gladly have retired to Loughrea once more, and pursued
      his old habits; but, like a blackleg who has accidentally discovered his
      skill at the game, no one would play with him again, and so he was fain to
      put up with his changed condition, and be a &ldquo;gentleman,&rdquo; as he called it,
      in spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He it was who, under the pretence of a friendly call to see the Knight,
      now drove into the courtyard of Gwynne Abbey. His equipage was a small
      four-wheeled chair close to the ground, and drawn by a rough mountain pony
      which, in size and shape, closely resembled a water-dog. The owner of this
      unpretending conveyance was a very diminutive, thin old man, with a long,
      almost transparent nose, the tip of which was of a raspberry red; a stiff
      queue, formed of his wiry gray hair carefully brushed back, even from the
      temples, made a graceful curve on his back, or occasionally appeared in
      front of his left shoulder. His voice was a feeble treble, with a
      tremulous quiver through all he said, while he usually finished each
      sentence with a faint effort content with his opinion; and this, on
      remarkable occasions, at a laugh, a kind of acknowledgment to himself that
      he was would be followed by the monosyllable &ldquo;ay,&rdquo;&mdash;a word which,
      brief as it was, struck terror into many a heart, intimating, as it did,
      that old Peter had just satisfied himself that he had made a good bargain,
      and that the other party was &ldquo;done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The most remarkable circumstance of his appearance was his mode of
      walking, and even here was displayed his wonted ingenuity. A partial
      paralysis had for some years affected his limbs, and particularly the
      muscles which raise and flex the legs; to obviate this infirmity, he
      fastened a cord with a loop to either foot, and by drawing them up
      alternately he was enabled to move forward, at a slow pace, to be sure,
      and in a manner it was rather difficult to witness for the first time with
      becoming gravity. This was more remarkable when he endeavored to get on
      faster, for then the flexion, a process which required a little time, was
      either imperfectly performed or altogether omitted, and consequently he
      remained stationary, and only hopped from one leg to the other after the
      fashion of a stage procession. His dress was a rusty black coat with a
      standing collar, black shorts, and white cotton stockings, over which the
      short black gaiters reached half way up the leg; on the present occasion
      he also wore a spencer of light gray cloth, as the day was cold and
      frosty, and his hat was fastened under his chin by a ribbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so he is n&rsquo;t at home, Tate,&rdquo; said he, as he sat whipping the pony
      from habit,&mdash;a process which the beast seemed to regard with a
      contemptuous indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Docther,&rdquo; for by this title the old man was always addressed by
      preference, &ldquo;the Knight&rsquo;s up in Dublin; he went on Monday last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is the seventh of the month,&rdquo; muttered the other to himself.
      &ldquo;Faith, he takes it easy, anyhow! And you don&rsquo;t know when he&rsquo;ll be home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sorra know I know, Docther; &lsquo;t is maybe to-night he &lsquo;d come&mdash;maybe
      to-morrow&mdash;maybe it would be three weeks or a month; and it&rsquo;s not but
      we want him badly this day, if it was God&rsquo;s will he was here!&rdquo; These words
      were uttered in a tone that Tate intended should provoke further
      questioning, for he was most eager to tell of the duel and its
      consequences; but the &ldquo;doctor&rdquo; never noticed them, but merely muttered a
      short &ldquo;Ay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Hickman?&rdquo; cried out the deep voice of Bagenal Daly at the
      same moment. &ldquo;You did n&rsquo;t chance to see Mulville on the road, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do, Mister Daly? I hope I see you well. I did n&rsquo;t meet Dr.
      Mulville this morning,&mdash;is there anything that&rsquo;s wrong here? Who is
      it that&rsquo;s ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young fellow, a stranger, who has been burning powder with Mr.
      MacDonough up at Cluan, and has been hit under the rib here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, what folly it is, and all about nothing, I &lsquo;ll engage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So your grandson would tell you,&rdquo; said Daly, sternly; &ldquo;for if he felt it
      to be anything, this quarrel should have been his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, and I&rsquo;m glad he left it alone,&rdquo; said the other, complacently; &ldquo;&lsquo;t
      is little good comes of the same fighting. I &lsquo;ll be eighty-five if I live
      to March next, and I never drew sword nor trigger yet against any man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One reason for which forbearance is, sir, that you thereby escaped a
      similar casualty to yourself. A laudable prudence, and likely to become a
      family virtue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old doctor felt all the severity of this taunt against his grandson,
      but he merely gave one of his half-subdued laughs, and said, in a low
      voice, &ldquo;Did you get a note from me, about a fortnight ago? Ay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I received one from your attorney,&rdquo; said Daly, carelessly, &ldquo;and I threw
      it into the fire without reading it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was hasty, that was rash, Mr. Daly,&rdquo; resumed the other, calmly; &ldquo;it
      was about the bond for the four thousand six hundred&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash;n me if I care what was the object of it! I happened to
      have some weightier things to think of than usury and compound interest,
      as I, indeed, have at this moment. By the by, if you have not forgotten
      the old craft, come in and see this poor fellow. I &lsquo;m much mistaken, or
      his time will be but short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, that&rsquo;s a debt there&rsquo;s no escaping!&rdquo; muttered the old man,
      combining his vein of moralizing with a sly sarcasm at Daly, while he
      began the complicated series of manouvres by which he usually effected his
      descent from the pony carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the large library, and on a bed hastily brought down for the purpose,
      lay Forester, his dress disordered, and his features devoid of all color.
      The glazed expression of his eye, and his pallid, half-parted lips showed
      that he was suffering from great loss of blood, for, unhappily, Mr. Daly&rsquo;s
      surgery had not succeeded in arresting this symptom. His breathing was
      short and irregular, and in the convulsive movement of his fingers might
      be seen the evidence of acute suffering. At the side of the bed, calm,
      motionless, and self-possessed, with an air as stern as a soldier at his
      post, stood Sandy M&rsquo;Grane; he had been ordered by his master to maintain a
      perfect silence, and to avoid, if possible, even a reply to Forester&rsquo;s
      questions, should he speak to him. The failure of the first few efforts on
      Forester&rsquo;s part to obtain an infraction of this rule ended in his
      submitting to his destiny, and supplying by signs the want of speech; in
      this way he had just succeeded in procuring a drink of water, when Daly
      entered, followed by Hickman. As with slow and noiseless steps they came
      forward, Forester turned his head, and, catching a glance of the mechanism
      by which old Peter regulated his progression, he burst into a fit of
      uncontrollable laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye mauna do it, ye mauna do it, sir,&rdquo; said Sandy, sternly; &ldquo;ye are lying
      in a pool of blood this minute, and it&rsquo;s no time for a hearty laugh. Ech!
      ech! sir,&rdquo; continued he, turning towards his master, &ldquo;if we had that salve
      the Delawares used to put on their wounds, I wadna say but we &lsquo;d stap it
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time old Peter had laid his hand on the sick man&rsquo;s wrist, and,
      with a large watch laid before him on the bed, was counting his pulse
      aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hundred and fifty,&rdquo; said he, in a whisper, which, although
      intended for Daly&rsquo;s ear, was overheard by Forester; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s thin as a
      thread, and looks like inward bleeding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done, then? have you anything to advise?&rdquo; said Daly, almost
      savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very little,&rdquo; said Hickman, with a malignant grin, &ldquo;except writing to his
      friends. I know nothing else to serve him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A brief shudder passed over Daly&rsquo;s stern features, rather like the
      momentary sense of cold than proceeding from any mental emotion, and then
      he said, &ldquo;I spoke to you as a doctor, sir; and I ask you again, is there
      nothing can be done for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, we might plug up the wound, to be sure, and give him a little
      wine, for he&rsquo;s sinking fast. I &lsquo;ve got a case of instruments and some lint
      in the gig&mdash;never go without the tools, Mr. Daly&mdash;there&rsquo;s no
      knowing when one may meet a little accident like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name, then, lose no time!&rdquo; said Daly. &ldquo;Whatever you can do,
      do it at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of command in which he spoke seemed to act like a charm on the
      old doctor, for he turned at once to hobble from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My servant will bring what you want,&rdquo; said Daly, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Peter, shaking his head, &ldquo;I have them under lock and key in
      the driving-box; there&rsquo;s no one opens that but myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daly turned away with a muttered execration at the miser&rsquo;s suspicions, and
      then, fixing his eyes steadily on Sandy&rsquo;s face, he gave a short and
      significant nod. The servant instinctively looked after the doctor; then,
      slowly moving across the floor, the nod was repeated, and Sandy, wheeling
      round, made three strides, and, catching the old man round the body with
      his remaining arm, carried him out of the room with the same indifference
      to his struggles or his cries as a nurse would bestow on a misbehaving
      urchin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0004" id="linkimage-0004">
      <!-- IMG --></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/108.jpg" width="100%" alt="108 " />
    </div>
    <p>
      When Sandy deposited his burden beside the pony-carriage, old Peter&rsquo;s
      passion had reached its climax, and assuredly, if the will could have
      prompted the act, he would have stamped as roundly as he swore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awfu&rsquo; thing,&rdquo; observed Sandy, quaintly, &ldquo;to see an auld carle,
      wi&rsquo; his twa legs in the grave, blaspheming that gate; but come awa&rsquo;, tak&rsquo;
      your gimcracks, and let&rsquo;s get back again, or, by the saul of my body, I
      &lsquo;ll pit you in the fountain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reasoning on that excellent principle of analogy, that what had happened
      might happen again even in a worse form, old Hickman unlocked the box and
      delivered into Sandy&rsquo;s hands a black leather case, bearing as many signs
      of long years and service as his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me walk I let me walk!&rdquo; cried he, in a supplicating tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Av you ca&rsquo; it walking,&rdquo; said Sandy, grimly; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s mair, far mair,
      like the step o&rsquo; a goose than a Christian man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What success might have attended Peter&rsquo;s request it is difficult to say,
      for at this moment the noise of a horse was heard galloping up the avenue,
      and, immediately after, Mulville, the surgeon sent for by Mr. Daly,
      entered the courtyard. Without deigning a look towards Hickman, or paying
      even the slightest attention to his urgent demands for the restoration of
      his pocket-case, Sandy seized Mulville by the arm and hurried him away to
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newly arrived doctor was an army surgeon, and proceeded, with all the
      readiness experience had taught him, to examine Forester&rsquo;s wound; while
      Sandy, to save time, opened old Hickman&rsquo;s case on the bed, and arranged
      the instruments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Mr. Daly,&rdquo; said the doctor, as he drew some lint from the
      antiquated leather pocket,&mdash;&ldquo;look here, and see how our old friend
      practises the art of medicine.&rdquo; He took up, as he spoke, a roll of paper,
      and held it towards Daly: it was a packet of bill stamps of various value,
      for old Peter could never suffer himself to be taken short, and was always
      provided with the ready means of transacting money affairs with his
      patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my d&mdash;&mdash;d old bond,&rdquo; said Daly, laughing, as he drew
      forth a much-crumpled and time-discolored parchment; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d venture to say
      the man would deserve well of his country who would throw this confounded
      pocket-book, and its whole contents, into that fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye maybe want some o&rsquo; the tools yet,&rdquo; said Sandy, dryly, for, taking his
      master&rsquo;s observations in the light of a command, he was about to commit
      the case and the paper to the flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care! take care!&rdquo; said Mulville, in a whisper; &ldquo;it might be a
      felony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devilish little Sandy would care what name they would give it,&rdquo;
       replied Daly; &ldquo;he &lsquo;d put the owner on the top of them, and burn all
      together, on a very brief hint;&rdquo; then, lowering his voice, he added,
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s his chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chance of every young fellow of two or three-and-twenty to live
      through what would kill any man of my time of life. With good care and
      quiet, but quiet above all, he may rub through it. We must leave him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;ll remain here,&rdquo; said Daly; &ldquo;you &lsquo;ll not quit this, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a day or two at least, I &lsquo;ll not leave him.&rdquo; And with this
      satisfactory assurance Daly closed the door, leaving Sandy on guard over
      the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your case of instruments, Hickman,&rdquo; said Daly, as the old doctor
      sat motionless in his gig, awaiting their reappearance; for, in his dread
      of further violence, he had preferred thus patiently to await their
      return, than venture once more into the company of Sandy M&rsquo;Grane. &ldquo;We &lsquo;ve
      robbed you of nothing except some lint; and,&rdquo; added he in a whisper to
      Muiville, &ldquo;I very much doubt if that case were ever opened and closed
      before with so slight an offence against the laws of property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Hickman by this time had opened the pocket-book, and was busily
      engaged inspecting its contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that&rsquo;s the bond!&rdquo; said Daly, laughing; &ldquo;you may well think how small
      the chance of repayment is, when I did not think it worth while burning
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be paid in good time,&rdquo; said Hickman, in a low cackle, &ldquo;and the
      interest too, maybe&mdash;ay!&rdquo; And with sundry admonitions from the whip,
      and successive chucks of the rein, the old pony threw up his head, shook
      his tail crossly, and, with a step almost as measured as that of his
      master, moved slowly out of the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much for our century and our civilization!&rdquo; said Daly, as he looked
      after him; &ldquo;the old miser that goes there has more power over our country
      and its gentry than ever a feudal chief wielded in the days of vassalage.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. &ldquo;DALY&rsquo;S.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      It was upon one of the very coldest evenings of the memorably severe
      January of 1800 that the doors of Daly&rsquo;s Club House were besieged by
      carriages of every shape and description: some brilliant in all the lustre
      of a perfect equipage; others more plainly denoting the country gentleman
      or the professional man; and others, again, the chance occupants of the
      various coach-stands, displayed every variety of that now extinct family
      whose members went under the denominations of &ldquo;whiskeys,&rdquo; &ldquo;jingles,&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;noddies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A heavy fall of sleet, accompanied with a cutting north wind, did not
      prevent the assemblage of a considerable crowd, who, by the strange
      sympathy of gregarious curiosity, were drawn up in front of the building,
      satisfied to think that something unusual, of what nature they knew not,
      was going forward within, and content to gaze on the brilliant glare of
      the lustres as seen through the drawn curtains, and mark the shadowy
      outlines of figures as they passed and repassed continually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the mob, for it was in reality such, to speculate on the cause of
      this extraordinary gathering, we shall at once proceed up the ample stair
      and enter the great saloon of the Club, which, opening by eight windows
      upon College Green, formed the conversation-room of the members.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here were now assembled between three and four hundred persons, gathered
      in groups and knots, and talking with all the eagerness some engrossing
      topic could suggest. In dress, air, and manner they seemed to represent
      sections of every social circle of the capital: some, in full Castle
      costume, had just escaped from the table of the Viceroy; others, in
      military uniform or the dress of the Club, contrasted with coats of
      country squires or the even more ungainly quaintness of the lawyers&rsquo;
      costume. They were of every age, from the young man emerging into life, to
      the old frequenter of the Club, who had occupied his own place and chair
      for half a century, and in manner and style as various, many preserving
      the courteous observances of the old school in all its polished urbanity,
      and the younger part of the company exhibiting the traits of a more
      independent, but certainly less graceful, politeness. Happily for the
      social enjoyments of the time, political leanings had not contributed
      their bitterness to private life, and men of opinions the most opposite,
      and party connections most antagonistic, were here met, willing to lay
      aside for a season the arms of encounter, or to use them with only the
      sportive pleasantry of a polished wit. If this manly spirit of mutual
      forbearance did not characterize the very last debates of the Irish
      Parliament, it may in a great measure be attributed to the nature of that
      influence by which the measure of the Union was carried; for bribery not
      only corrupted the venal, but it soured and irritated the men who rejected
      its seductions; and in this wise a difference was created between the two
      parties, wider and more irreconcilable than all which political animosity
      or mere party dislike could effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the present occasion, however, the animating spirit of the assemblage
      seemed to partake of nothing less than a feature of political acrimony;
      and amid the chance phrases which met the ear, and the hearty bursts of
      laughter that every moment broke forth, it was easy to collect that no
      question of a party nature occupied their attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the room a group of some twenty persons stood or sat around
      a chair in which a thin elderly gentleman was seated, his fine and
      delicately marked features far more unequivocally proclaiming rank than
      even the glittering star he wore on his breast. Without being in reality
      very old, Lord Drogheda seemed so, for, partly from delicacy of health,
      and partly, as some affirmed, from an affectation of age (a more frequent
      thing than is expected), he had contracted a stoop, and walked with every
      sign of debility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen, how does time go?&rdquo; said he, with an easy smile. &ldquo;Are we
      not near the hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it wants but eleven minutes of ten now, my Lord,&rdquo; said one of the
      group. &ldquo;Do you mean to hold him sharp to time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad, I should think so,&rdquo; interrupted a red-whiskered squire, in splashed
      top-boots. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve ridden in from Kildare to-night to see the match, and I
      protest against any put-off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Drogheda turned his eyes towards the speaker with a look in which
      mildness was so marked, it could not be called reproof, but it evidently
      confused him, as he added, &ldquo;Of course, if the gentlemen who have heavy
      wagers on it are content I must be also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, for one, say &lsquo;sharp time,&rsquo;&rdquo; cried out a dapperly dressed young fellow,
      with an open pocket-book in his hand; &ldquo;play or pay is the only rule in
      these cases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ve backed my Lord at eight to ten, in hundreds,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;and
      certainly I &lsquo;ll claim my bet if the Knight is one minute late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have just three to decide that question,&rdquo; said one at his side.
      &ldquo;My watch is with the Post-office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite, time enough left to order my carriage,&rdquo; said Lord Drogheda, rising
      with an energy very different from his ordinary indolent habit. &ldquo;If the
      Knight of Gwynne should be accidentally delayed, gentlemen, I, for my
      part, prefer being also absent. It will then be a matter of some
      difficulty for the parties betting to say who is the delinquent.&rdquo; He took
      his hat as he spoke, and was moving through the crowd, when a sudden cheer
      from without was heard, and then, almost the instant after, a confused
      sound of acclamation as the Knight of Gwynne entered, leaning on the arm
      of Con Heffernan. Making his way with difficulty through the crowd of
      welcoming friends and acquaintances, the Knight approached the end of the
      room where Lord Drogheda now awaited him, standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not late, my Lord, though very near it,&rdquo; said he, extending his hand. &ldquo;If
      I should apologize, however, I have an excuse you will not reject,&mdash;Con
      Heffernan&rsquo;s Burgundy is hard to part with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, Knight,&rdquo; said his Lordship, smiling. &ldquo;With a friend one sees
      so seldom, a little dalliance is most pardonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sarcasm was met by a ready laugh, for Heffernan was better known as a
      guest at other tables than a host at his own; nor did he, at whose expense
      the jest was made, refrain from joining in the mirth, while he added,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Burgundy, like one of your Lordship&rsquo;s <i>bons mots</i>, is perhaps
      appreciated the more highly because of its rarity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, Heffernan,&rdquo; replied Lord Drogheda; &ldquo;we should keep our wit and
      wine only for our best friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, then,&rdquo; whispered the red-whiskered squire who spoke before, &ldquo;if
      the liquor does not gain more by keeping than the wit, I&rsquo;d recommend Con
      to drink it off a little faster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or, better still,&rdquo; interposed the Knight, &ldquo;only give it to those who
      understand its flavor. But we are, if I mistake not, losing very valuable
      time. What say you to the small room off the library, or will your
      Lordship remain here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, if equally agreeable to you. We are both of us too old in the
      harness to care much for being surrounded by spectators.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true, Con,&rdquo; said a friend in Heffernan&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;that Darcy has laid
      fifty thousand on this party?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are rather under than over the mark,&rdquo; whispered Heffernan.
      &ldquo;The wager has been off and on these last eight or ten years. It was made
      at Hutchinson&rsquo;s one evening when we all had drunk a good deal of wine. At
      first, whist was talked of; but Drogheda objected to Darcy&rsquo;s naming Vicars
      as his partner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More fool he! Vicars is a first-rate player, but confoundedly unlucky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be that as it may, they fixed on piquet as the game, and, if accounts be
      true, all the better for Darcy. They say he has beaten the best players in
      France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is really the stake? One hears so many absurd versions of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Ballydermot property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every acre, with the demesne, house, plate, pictures, carriages, wine,&mdash;begad!
      I &lsquo;m not sure if the livery servants are not included,&mdash;against fifty
      thousand pounds. You know Drogheda has lent him a very large sum on a
      mortgage of that property already, and this will make the thing about
      double or quits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Heffernan,&rdquo; cried the Knight, &ldquo;are you making your book there? When
      you&rsquo;ve quite finished, let me have a pinch of that excellent snuff of
      yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not try mine?&rdquo; said Lord Drogheda, pushing a magnificently jewelled
      box, containing a miniature, across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;T would be a bad augury, my Lord,&rdquo; said Darcy, laughing. &ldquo;If I remember
      aright, you won this handsome box from the Duke de Richelieu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you know that story, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was present at the time, and remember the circumstance perfectly. The
      King was leaning over the Duke&rsquo;s chair, watching the game&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true. The Duke affected not to know that his Majesty was there, and
      when he placed the box on the table, cried, &lsquo;A thousand louis against the
      portrait of the King!&rsquo; There was no declining such a wager at such a
      moment, although, intrinsically, the box was not worth half the sum. I
      accepted, and won it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Duke then offered to give you twice the money for it back again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did so, and I refused. I shall not readily forget the sweet, sad smile
      of the King as he tapped the wily courtier on the shoulder, and said, &lsquo;Ah!
      Monsieur le Duc, do you only value your King when you&rsquo;ve lost him?&rsquo; They
      were prophetic words! Well, well! we &lsquo;ve got upon a sorrowful theme; let&rsquo;s
      change it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are the cards, at last,&rdquo; said the Knight, taking a sealed packet
      from the waiter&rsquo;s hand, and breaking it open on the table. &ldquo;Now,
      Heffernan, order me a glass of claret negus, and take care that no one
      comes to worry us with news of the House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sugar bill, or a new clause in the Corporation Act, or something
      of that kind, they &lsquo;re working at,&rdquo; said Lord Drogheda, negligently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my Lord,&rdquo; interposed Heffernan, slyly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a bill to permit your
      Lordship&rsquo;s nephew to hold the living of Ardragh with his deanery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right and proper,&rdquo; said his Lordship, endeavoring to hide a rising
      flush on his cheek by an opportune laugh. &ldquo;Tom is a capital fellow, and a
      good parson too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ought never to omit the prayer for the Parliament!&rdquo; muttered
      Heffernan, loud enough to be heard by the bystanders, who relished the
      allusion heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deal is with you, Knight,&rdquo; said Lord Drogheda, pushing the cards
      across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment afterwards, a pin could not have fallen unheard in that crowded
      assembly. Even they who were not themselves bettors felt the deepest
      interest in the game where the stake was so great, and all who could set
      value on skill and address were curious to watch the progress of the
      contest. Not a word was spoken on either side as the cards fell upon the
      table, and although many of the bystanders displayed looks of more eager
      anxiety, the players showed by their intentness how strenuously each
      struggled for the victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the lapse of about half an hour, a low, murmuring noise spread
      through the room, and the news was circulated that the first game was
      over, and the Knight was the winner. The players, however, were silent as
      before, and the deal went over without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, my Lord,&rdquo; said Darcy, as he gently interposed his hand to
      prevent Lord Drogheda taking up his cards,&mdash;&ldquo;a single moment. You
      will call me faint-hearted for it, but I do not care. I beseech you, let
      the party cease here. It is a great favor; but as I could not ask it if I
      had lost the game, give me, I pray, so much of advantage for my good
      luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, Knight, that I, as a loser, could not accede to your
      proposal; what would be said of any man who, with such a stake at issue,
      accepted an offer like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lord, don&rsquo;t you think that you and I might afford to have our
      actions canvassed, and yet be very little afraid of criticism?&rdquo; said
      Darcy, proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my dear Darcy, I really could not do this; besides, you must
      concede something to mortified vanity. Now, I am anxious to have my
      revenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so, my Lord,&rdquo; said the Knight, with a sigh, and the game began.
    </p>
    <p>
      The looks and glances which were interchanged by those about during this
      brief colloquy showed how little sympathy there was felt with the
      generosity of either side. The bettors had set their hearts on gain, and
      cared little for the feelings of the players.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see he was right,&rdquo; whispered the red-whiskered squire to his
      neighbor; &ldquo;my Lord has won the game in one hand.&rdquo; And so it was; in less
      than five minutes the party was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for the conqueror,&rdquo; cried the Knight of Gwynne, who, somewhat nettled
      at a success which seemed to lessen the generous character of his own
      proposal, dealt the cards hastily, as if anxious to conclude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Darcy, we have a better opportunity,&rdquo; said Lord Drogheda, smiling;
      &ldquo;what say you to draw stakes as we stand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly, most willingly, my Lord. If a bad cause saps courage, I have
      reason to be low at heart. This foolish wager has cost me the loss of
      three nights&rsquo; sleep, and if you are content&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are these gentlemen here satisfied?&rdquo; said Lord Drogheda; and an
      almost universal cry of &ldquo;No&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then if we are to play for the bystanders, my Lord, let us not delay
      them,&rdquo; said the Knight, as he took up his cards and began to arrange them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darcy has it, by Jove!&mdash;the game is his,&rdquo; was muttered from one to
      another in the crowd behind his chair, and the report, gaining currency,
      was soon circulated in the larger room without.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anything heavy on it, Con?&rdquo; said a fashionably dressed man to
      Heffernan, who endeavored to force his way through the crowd to where the
      Knight sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at Heffernan!&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;They say he never bets; but mark the
      excitement of his face now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Heffernan?&rdquo; said the Knight, as the other leaned over his
      chair and tried to whisper something in his ear. &ldquo;Is that a queen, my
      Lord? In that case I believe the game is mine.&mdash;What is it,
      Heffernan?&rdquo; and he bent his ear to listen; then, suddenly dashing the
      cards upon the table, cried out, &ldquo;Great Heaven! is this true?&mdash;the
      young fellow I met at Kilbeggan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same,&rdquo; whispered Heffernan, rapidly; &ldquo;a brother officer of your son
      Lionel&rsquo;s&mdash;a cousin of Lord Castle-reagh&rsquo;s&mdash;a fine, dashing
      fellow, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he wounded?&rdquo; asked Darcy, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finish your game&mdash;I must tell you all about it,&rdquo; said Heffernan,
      folding up a letter which he had taken from his pocket a few minutes
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pardon, my Lord,&rdquo; said Darcy, with a look full of agitation; &ldquo;I have
      just heard very bad news.&mdash;I play the knave.&rdquo; A murmur ran through
      the crowd behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You meant the king, I know, Knight,&rdquo; said Lord Drogheda, restoring the
      card to his hand as he spoke, but a loud expression of dissatisfaction
      arose from those at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my Lord, I did intend the king,&rdquo; said the Knight; &ldquo;but
      these gentlemen insist upon the knave, and, if you &lsquo;ll permit me, I &lsquo;ll
      play it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole fortune of the game hung upon the card, and, after a brief
      struggle, the Knight was beaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so, my Lord,&rdquo; said the Knight, smiling calmly, &ldquo;you have beaten me
      against luck; Fortune will not do everything. The Roman satirist goes even
      further, and says she can do nothing.&rdquo; He rose as he said these words, and
      looked around for Heffernan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want Con Heffernan, Knight,&rdquo; said one of the party, &ldquo;I think he
      has gone down to the House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very man,&rdquo; said Darcy. &ldquo;Good-night, my Lord,&mdash;good-night,
      gentlemen all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not believe that anything could shake Darcy&rsquo;s nerve, but he
      certainly played that game ill,&rdquo; said a bystander.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heffernan could tell us more about it,&rdquo; said another; &ldquo;rely on it, Master
      Con and the devil knew why that knave was played.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. AN INTRIGUE DETECTED
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of all the evil influences which swayed the destinies of Ireland in latter
      days, none can compare, in extent of importance, with the fatal taste for
      prodigality that characterized the habits of the gentry. Reckless,
      wasteful extravagance, in every detail of life, suggested modes of acting
      and thinking at variance with all individual and, consequently, all
      national prosperity. Hospitality was pushed to profusion, liberality
      became a spendthrift habit. The good and the bad qualities of the Irish
      temperament alike contributed to this passion; there was the wish to
      please, the desire to receive courteously, and entertain with splendor
      within doors, and to appear with proportionate magnificence without.
    </p>
    <p>
      A proud sense of what they deemed befitting their station induced the
      gentry to vie in expenditure with the richly endowed officials of the
      Government, and the very thought of prudence or foresight in matters of
      expense would have been stigmatized as a meanness by those who believed
      they were sustaining the honor of their country while sapping the
      foundation of its prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we have little to plead in defence or in palliation of such habits, we
      can at least affirm that in many cases they were practised with a taste
      and elegance that shed lustre over the period. Unlike the vulgar displays
      of newly acquired wealth, they exhibited in a striking light the generous
      and high-spirited features of the native character, which deemed that
      nothing could be too good for the guest, nor any expenditure for his
      entertainment either too costly or too difficult. The fatal facility of
      Irish nature, and the still more ruinous influence of example, hurried men
      along on this road to ruin; and as political prospects grew darker, a
      reckless indifference to the future succeeded, in which little care was
      taken for the morrow, until, at last, thoughtless extravagance became a
      habit, and moneyed difficulties the lot of almost every family of Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      That a gentry so embarrassed, and with such prospects of ruin before them,
      should have been easy victims to Ministerial seduction, is far less
      surprising than that so many were to be seen who could prefer their
      integrity to the rich bribes of Government patronage; and it is a
      redeeming feature of the day that amid all the lavish and heedless course
      of prodigality and excess there were some who could face poverty with
      stouter hearts than they could endure the stigma of gilded corruption: nor
      is it the history of every Parliament that can say as much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us leave this theme, even at the hazard of being misunderstood, for
      the moment, by our reader, and turn to the Knight of Gwynne, who now was
      seated at his breakfast in a large parlor of his house in Henrietta
      Street. Sad and deserted as it seems now, this was in those days the
      choice residence of Irish aristocracy, and the names of peers and baronets
      on every door told of a class which, now, should be sought for in
      scattered fragments among the distant cities of the Continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knight was reading the morning papers, in which, amid the fashionable
      news, was an account of his own wager with Lord Drogheda, when a carriage
      drove up hastily to the door, and, immediately after, the loud summons of
      a footman resounded through the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Knight was yet wondering who this early visitor should prove,
      the servant announced Mr. Con Heffernan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very man I wished to see,&rdquo; cried Darcy, eagerly; &ldquo;tell me all about
      this unfortunate business. But, first of all, is he out of danger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite safe. I understand, for a time, it was a very doubtful thing;
      Daly&rsquo;s surgery, it would seem, rather increased the hazard. He began
      searching for the ball regardless of the bleeding, and the young fellow
      was very near sinking under loss of blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole affair was his doing!&rdquo; said the Knight, impatiently. &ldquo;How Mr.
      MacDonough could have found himself at <i>my</i> table is more than I can
      well imagine; that when he got there, something like this would follow,
      does not surprise me. Daly is really too bad. Well, well, I hoped to have
      set off for the abbey to-day, but I must stay here, I find; Drogheda is
      kind enough to let me redeem Ballydermot, and I must see Gleeson about it.
      It&rsquo;s rather a heavy blow just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I am not altogether blameless,&rdquo; said Heffernan, timidly. &ldquo;I
      ought not to have mentioned that unlucky business till the game was over;
      but I thought your nerve was proof against anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it was, Heffernan,&rdquo; said the Knight, laughing, &ldquo;some five-and-twenty
      years ago; but this shattered wreck has little remains of the old
      three-decker. I should have won that game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all past and over now, so never think more about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I should have won the game. Drogheda saw my advantage: he went on
      with the very suit in my hand, and when he reached over for his snuff-box,
      his hand trembled like in an ague-fit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, don&rsquo;t let the thing dwell in your mind. There is another and a
      heavier game to play, and you &lsquo;re certain to win there, if you do but like
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t clearly understand you,&rdquo; said Darcy, doubtingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be explicit enough, then,&rdquo; said Heffernan, taking a chair and
      seating himself directly in front of the Knight. &ldquo;You know the position of
      the Government at this moment. They have secured a safe and certain
      majority,&mdash;the &lsquo;Union&rsquo; is carried. When I say &lsquo;carried,&rsquo; I mean that
      there is not a doubt on any reasonable mind but that the bill will pass.
      The lists show a majority of seven, perhaps eight, for the Ministry; and
      if they had but one in their favor, Pitt is determined to go through with
      it. Now, we all very well know how this has been done. Our people have
      behaved infamously, disgracefully,&mdash;there&rsquo;s no mincing the matter.
      You heard of Fox&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. What of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has just accepted the escheatorship of&mdash;I forget what or where,
      but he vacates his seat to make room for Courtenay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam Courtenay?&mdash;Scrub, as we used to call him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scrub,&mdash;exactly so. Well, he comes in for Roscommon, and is to have
      a place under the new commission of twelve hundred a year. But to go back
      to what I was saying: Castlereagh has bought these fellows at his price or
      their own; some were dear enough, some were cheap. Barton, for instance,
      takes it out in Castle dinners, and has sold his birthright for the
      Viceroy&rsquo;s venison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May good digestion wait on appetite!&rdquo; repeated Darcy, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s not waste more time on them, but come to what I mean.
      Castlereagh wants to know how you mean to vote: some have told him you
      would be on his side; others, myself among the number, say the reverse. In
      fact, little as you may think about the matter, heavy bets are laid at
      this moment on the question, and&mdash;But I won&rsquo;t mention names; enough
      if I say a friend of ours&mdash;an old friend, too&mdash;has a thousand on
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Knight tapped his snuff-box calmly, and with his blandest smile begged
      Heffernan to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith! I &lsquo;ve nearly told all I had to say. Every one well knows that,
      whatever decision you come to, it will be unbiassed by everything save
      your own conscientious sense of right; and as arguments are pretty nearly
      equal on the question,&mdash;for, in truth, after having heard and read
      most of what has been written or spoken on the point,&mdash;I &lsquo;m regularly
      nonplussed on which side to see the advantage. The real question seems to
      be, Can we go on as we are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; observed the Knight, gravely. &ldquo;A Parliament which has
      exhibited its venality so openly can have little pretension to public
      confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very remark I made myself,&rdquo; cried Heffernan, triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men who sell themselves to-day to the Crown will, if need be, sell
      themselves to-morrow to the mob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own words, by Jove!&mdash;my very words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dependent Parliament, attempting separate and independent legislation,
      means an absurdity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no other name for it,&rdquo; cried Heffernan, in ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have known Ireland for something more than half a century now,&rdquo; said
      the Knight, with a touch of melancholy in his voice, &ldquo;and yet never before
      saw so much of social disorder as at present, and perhaps we are only at
      the beginning of it. The scenes we have witnessed in France have been more
      bloody and more cruel, but they will leave less permanent results behind
      them than our own revolution; for such, after all, it is. The property of
      the country is changing hands, the old aristocracy are dying out, if not
      dead; their new successors have neither any hold on the affection of the
      people, nor a bond of union with each other. See what will come of it; the
      old game of feudalism will be tried by these men of yesterday, and the
      peasantry, whose reverence for birth is a religion, will turn on them, and
      the time is not very distant, perhaps, when the men who would not harm the
      landlord&rsquo;s dog will have little reverence for the landlord&rsquo;s self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have drawn a sad picture,&rdquo; said Heffernan, either feeling or
      affecting to feel the truthfulness of the Knight&rsquo;s delineation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our share in the ruin,&rdquo; said the Knight, rising, and pacing the room with
      rapid strides,&mdash;&ldquo;our share is not undeserved. We had a distinct and
      defined duty to perform, and we neglected it; instead of extending
      civilization, we were the messengers of barbarism among the people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your own estates, I have heard, are a refutation of your theory,&rdquo;
       interposed Heffernan, insinuatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My estates&mdash;&rdquo; repeated the Knight; and then, stopping suddenly, with
      a changed voice, he said, &ldquo;Heffernan, we have got into a long and very
      unprofitable theme; let us try back, if we can, and see whence we started:
      we were talking of the Union.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Heffernan, not sorry to resume the subject which induced
      his visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have determined not to vote on the measure,&rdquo; said the Knight, solemnly;
      &ldquo;my reasons for the course I adopt I hope to be able to justify when the
      proper time arrives; meanwhile, it will prevent unnecessary speculation,
      and equally unnecessary solicitation, if I tell you frankly what I mean to
      do. Such is my present resolve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word &ldquo;solicitation&rdquo; fell from the Knight&rsquo;s lips with such a peculiar
      expression that Heffernan at once saw his own game was detected, and, like
      a clever tactician, resolved to make the best of his forced position.

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been frank with me, Knight; I&rsquo;ll not be less candid with <i>you</i>,
      I came here to convey to you a distinct offer from the Government,&mdash;not
      of any personal favor or advantage, <i>that</i>, they well knew, you would
      reject,&mdash;but, in the event of your support, to take any suggestion
      you might make on the new Bill into their serious and favorable
      consideration; to advise with you how, in short, the measure might be made
      to meet your views, and, so to say, admit you into conclave with the
      Cabinet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this is very flattering,&rdquo; said the Knight, with a smile of evident
      satisfaction, &ldquo;but I scarcely see how the opinions of a very humble
      country gentleman can weigh in the grave councils of a Government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best proof is the fact itself,&rdquo; replied Heffernan, artfully. &ldquo;Were I
      to tell you of other reasons, you might suspect me of an intention to
      canvass your support on very different grounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess I&rsquo;m in the dark; explain yourself more fully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a day for sincerity,&rdquo; said Heffernan, smiling, &ldquo;and so, here it
      is: the Prince has taken a special liking to your son Lionel, and has
      given him his company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His company! I never heard of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange enough that he should not have written to you on the subject, but
      the fact is unquestionable; and, as I was saying, he is a frequent guest
      at Carlton House, and admitted into the choice circle of his Royal
      Highness&rsquo;s parties: if, in the freedom of that intimacy with which he is
      honored by the Prince, the question should have arisen, how his father
      meant to vote, the fact was not surprising, no more than that Captain
      Darcy should have replied&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lionel never pledged himself to control <i>my</i> vote, depend upon that,
      Mr. Heffernan,&rdquo; said the Knight, reddening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor did I say so,&rdquo; interposed Heffernan. &ldquo;Hear me out: your son is
      reported to have answered, &lsquo;My father&rsquo;s family have been too trained in
      loyalty, sire, not to give their voice for what they believe the best
      interests of the empire: your Royal Highness may doubt his judgment, his
      honor will, I am certain, never be called in question.&rsquo; The Prince laughed
      good-naturedly, and said, &lsquo;Enough, Darcy,&mdash;quite enough; it will give
      me great satisfaction to think as highly of the father as I do of the son;
      there is a vacancy on the staff, and I can offer you the post of an extra
      aide-de-camp.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very good news,&mdash;the best I &lsquo;ve heard for many a day,
      Heffernan; and for its accuracy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Castlereagh is the guarantee,&rdquo; added Heffernan, hastily; &ldquo;I had it
      from his own lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll wait on him this morning. I can at least express my gratitude for
      his Royal Highness&rsquo;s kindness to my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;ll not have far to go,&rdquo; said Heffernan, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Castlereagh is at the door this moment in that carriage;&rdquo; and
      Hefifernan pointed to the chariot which, with its blinds closely drawn,
      stood before the street door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knight moved hastily towards the door, and then, turning suddenly,
      burst into a hearty laugh,&mdash;a laugh so racy and full of enjoyment
      that Heffernan himself joined in it, without knowing wherefore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a clever fellow, Hefifernan!&rdquo; said the Knight, as he lay back in
      a deep-cushioned chair, and wiped his eyes, now streaming with tears of
      laughter,&mdash;&ldquo;a devilish clever fellow! The whole affair reminds me of
      poor Jack Morris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith! I don&rsquo;t see your meaning,&rdquo; said Hefifernan, half fearful that all
      was not right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew Jack,&mdash;we all knew him. Well, poor Morris was going home
      one night,&mdash;from the theatre, I believe it was,&mdash;but, just as he
      reached Ely Place, he saw, by the light of a lamp, a gentlemanlike fellow
      trying to make out an address on a letter, and endeavoring, as well as he
      could, to spell out the words by the uncertain light. &lsquo;Devilish
      provoking!&rsquo; said the stranger, half aloud; &lsquo;I wrote it myself, and yet
      cannot read a word of it.&rsquo; &lsquo;Can I be of any service?&rsquo; said Jack. Poor
      fellow! he was always ready for anything kind or good-natured. &lsquo;Thank
      you,&rsquo; said the other; &lsquo;but I &lsquo;m a stranger in Dublin,&mdash;only arrived
      this evening from Liverpool,&mdash;and cannot remember the name or the
      street of my hotel, although I noted both down on this letter.&rsquo; &lsquo;Show it
      to me,&rsquo; said Jack, taking the document. But although he held it every way,
      and tried all manner of guesses, he never could hit on the name the
      stranger wanted. &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said Jack; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t bother yourself about it.
      Come home with, me and have an oyster,&mdash;I &lsquo;ll give you a bed; &lsquo;t will
      be time enough after breakfast to-morrow to hunt out the hotel.&rsquo; To make
      short of it, the stranger complied; after all the natural expressions of
      gratitude and shame, home they went, supped, finished two bottles of
      claret, and chatted away till past two o&rsquo;clock. &lsquo;You &lsquo;d like to get to
      bed, I see,&rsquo; said Jack, as the stranger seemed growing somewhat drowsy,
      and so he rang the bell and ordered the servant to show the gentleman to
      his room. &lsquo;And, Martin,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;take care that everything is
      comfortable, and be sure you have a nightcap.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh! I &lsquo;ve a nightcap
      myself,&rsquo; said the stranger, pulling one, neatly folded, out of his coat
      pocket. &lsquo;Have you, by G&mdash;d!&rsquo; said Jack. &lsquo;If you have, then, you &lsquo;ll
      not sleep here. A man that&rsquo;s so ready for a contingency has generally some
      hand in contriving it.&rsquo; And so he put him out of doors, and never saw more
      of him. Eh, Heffernan, was Jack right?&rdquo; And again the old man broke into a
      hearty laugh, in which Heffernan, notwithstanding his discomfiture, could
      not refrain from participating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, as he arose to leave the room, &ldquo;I feel twenty years
      younger for that hearty laugh. It reminds me of the jolly days we used to
      have long ago, with Price Godfrey and Bagenal Daly. By the way, where is
      Bagenal now, and what is he doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty much what he always was doing,&mdash;mischief and devilment,&rdquo; said
      the Knight, half angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he still the member for Old-Castle? I forget what fate the petition
      had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fate of the counsel that undertook it is easily remembered,&rdquo; said the
      Knight. &ldquo;Bagenal called him out for daring to take such a liberty with a
      man who had represented the borough for thirty years, and shot him in the
      hip. &lsquo;You shall have a plumper, by Jove,&rsquo; said Bagenal; and he gave him
      one. Men grew shy of the case afterwards, and it was dropped, and so
      Bagenal still represents the place. Good-by, Heffernan; don&rsquo;t forget Jack
      Morris.&rdquo; And so saying, the Knight took leave of his visitor, and returned
      to his chair at the breakfast-table.

      CHAPTER XI. THE KNIGHT AND HIS AGENT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The news of Lionel&rsquo;s promotion, and the flattering notice which the Prince
      had taken of him, made the Knight very indifferent about his heavy loss of
      the preceding evening. It was, to be sure, an immense sum; but as Gleeson
      was arranging his affairs, it was only &ldquo;raising&rdquo; so much more, and thus
      preventing the estate from leaving the family. Such was his own very mode
      of settling the matter in his own mind, nor did he bestow more time on the
      consideration than enabled him to arrive at this satisfactory conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      If ever there was an agent designed to compensate for the easy, careless
      habits of such a principal, it was Mr. Gleeson, or, as he was universally
      known in the world of that day, &ldquo;Honest Tom Gleeson.&rdquo; In him seemed
      concentrated all those peculiar gifts which made up the perfect man of
      business. He was cautious, painstaking, and methodical; of a temper which
      nothing could ruffle, and with a patience no provocation could exhaust;
      punctual as a clock, neither precipitate nor dilatory, he appeared prompt
      to the slow, and seemed almost tardy to the hasty man.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the management of several large estates&mdash;he might have had many
      more if he would have accepted the charge&mdash;Mr. Gleeson had amassed a
      considerable fortune; but so devotedly did he attach himself to the
      interests of his employers, so thoroughly identify their fortunes with his
      own, that he gave little time to the cares of his immediate property. By
      his skill and intelligence many country gentlemen had emerged from
      embarrassments that threatened to engulf their entire fortunes; and his
      aid in a difficulty was looked upon as a certain guarantee of success. It
      was not very surprising if a man endowed with qualities like these should
      have usurped something of ascendency over his employers. To a certain
      extent their destiny lay in his hands. Of the difficulties by which they
      were pressed he alone knew either the nature or amount, while by what
      straits these should be overcome none but himself could offer a
      suggestion. If in all his dealings the most strict regard to honor was
      observable, so did he seem also inexhaustible in his contrivances to
      rescue an embarrassed or encumbered estate. There was often the greatest
      difficulty in securing his services, solicitation and interest were even
      required to engage him; but once retained, he applied his energies to the
      task, and with such zeal and acuteness that it was said no case, however
      desperate, had yet failed in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several years past he had managed all the Knight&rsquo;s estates; and such
      was the complication and entanglement of the property, loaded with
      mortgages and rent-charges, embarrassed with dowries and annuities, that
      nothing short of his admirable skill could have supported the means of
      that expensive and wasteful mode of life which the Knight insisted on
      pursuing, and all restriction on which he deemed unfitting his station. If
      Gleeson represented the urgent necessity of retrenchment, the very word
      was enough to cut short the negotiation; until, at last, the agent was
      fain to rest content with the fruits of good management, and merely
      venture from time to time on a cautious suggestion regarding the immense
      expense of the Knight&rsquo;s household.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all his guardedness and care, these representations were not always
      safe; for though the Knight would sometimes meet them with some jocular or
      witty reply, or some bantering allusion to the agent&rsquo;s taste for
      money-getting, at other times he would receive the advice with impatience
      or ill-humor, so that, at last, Gleeson limited all complaints on this
      score to his letters to Lady Eleanor, with whom he maintained a close and
      confidential correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reserve on Gleeson&rsquo;s part had its effects on the Knight, who felt a
      proportionate delicacy in avowing any act of extravagance that should
      demand a fresh call for money, and thus embarrass the negotiation by which
      the agent was endeavoring to extricate the property.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Darcy felt the loss of the preceding night, it was far more from the
      necessity of avowing it to Gleeson than from the amount of the money,
      considerable as it was; and he, therefore, set out to call upon him, in a
      frame of mind far less at ease than he desired to persuade himself he
      enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gleeson lived about three miles from Dublin, so that the Knight had
      abundant time to meditate as he went along, and think over the interview
      that awaited him. His revery was only broken by a sudden change from the
      high-road to the noiseless quiet of the neat avenue which led up to the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gleeson&rsquo;s abode had been an ancient manor-house in the Gwynne family,
      a building of such antiquity as to date from the time of the Knights
      Templars; and though once a favored residence of the Darcys, had, from the
      circumstances of a dreadful crime committed beneath its roof,&mdash;the
      murder of a servant by his master,&mdash;been at first deserted, and
      subsequently utterly neglected by the owners, so that at last it fell into
      ruin and decay. The roof was partly fallen in, the windows shattered and
      broken, the rich ceilings rotten and discolored with damp; it presented an
      aspect of desolation, when Mr. Gleeson proposed to take it on lease. Nor
      was the ruin only within doors, but without; the ornamental planting had
      been torn up, or used as firewood; the gardens pillaged and overrun with
      cattle; and the large trees&mdash;among which were some rare and
      remarkable ones&mdash;were lopped and torn by the country people, who
      trespassed and committed their depredations without fear or impediment.
      Now, however, the whole aspect was changed; the same spirit of order that
      exercised its happy influence in the management of distant properties had
      arrested the progress of destruction here, and, happily, in sufficient
      time to preserve some of the features which, in days past, had made this
      the most beautiful seat in the county.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not without a feeling of astonishment that the Knight surveyed the
      change. An interval of twelve years&mdash;for such had been the length of
      time since he was last there&mdash;had worked magic in all around. Clumps
      had sprung up into ornamental groups, saplings become graceful trees,
      sickly evergreens that leaned their frail stems against a stake were now
      richly leaved hollies or fragrant laurustinas; and the marshy pond, that
      seemed stagnant with rank grass and duckweed, was a clear lake fed by a
      silvery cascade which descended in quaint but graceful terraces from the
      very end of the neat lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Darcy&rsquo;s eyes, the only fault was the excessive neatness perceptible in
      everything; the very gravel seemed to shine with a peculiar lustre, the
      alleys were swept clean, not even a withered leaf was suffered to
      disfigure them, while the shrubs had an air of trim propriety, like the
      self-satisfied air of a Sunday citizen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brilliant lustre of the heavy brass knocker, the white and spotless
      flags of the stone hall, and the immaculate accuracy of the staid footman
      who opened the door, were types of the prevailing tastes and habits of the
      proprietor. A mere glance at the orderly arrangement of Mr. Gleeson&rsquo;s
      study would have confirmed the impression of his strict notions and
      regularity of discipline: not a book was out of place; the boxes, labelled
      with high and titled names, were ranged with a drill-like precision upon
      the shelves; the very letters that lay in the baskets beside the table
      fell with an attention to staid decorum becoming the rigid habits of the
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knight had some minutes to bestow in contemplation of these objects
      before Gleeson entered; he had only that morning arrived from a distant
      journey, and was dressing when the Knight was announced. With a bland,
      soft manner, and an air compounded of diffidence and self-importance, Mr.
      Gleeson made his approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have anticipated me, sir,&rdquo; said he, placing a chair for the Knight;
      &ldquo;I had ordered the carriage to call upon you. May I beg you to excuse the
      question, but my anxiety will not permit me to defer it: there is no
      truth, or very little, I trust, in the paragraph I &lsquo;ve just read in
      Carrick&rsquo;s paper&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a party at piquet with Lord Drogheda?&rdquo; interrupted Darcy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every word of it correct, Gleeson,&rdquo; said the Knight, who, notwithstanding
      the occasion, could not control the temptation to laugh at the terrified
      expression of the agent&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely the sum was exaggerated; the paper says, the lands and demesne
      of Ballydermot, with the house, furniture, plate, wine, equipage, garden
      utensils&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m not sure that we mentioned the watering-pots,&rdquo; said Darcy, smiling;
      &ldquo;but the wine hogsheads are certainly included.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rental of clear three thousand four hundred and seventy-eight pounds,
      odd shillings, on a lease of lives renewable forever&mdash;pepercorn
      fine!&rdquo; exclaimed Gleeson, closing his eyes, and folding his hands upon his
      breast, like a martyr resigning himself to the torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much for going on spades without the head of the suit!&rdquo; observed the
      Knight; &ldquo;and yet any man might have made the same blunder; and then,
      Heffernan, with his interruption,&mdash;altogether, Gleeson, the whole was
      mismanaged sadly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The greater, part of the land tithe free,&rdquo; moaned Gleeson to himself; &ldquo;it
      was a grant from the Crown to your ancestor, Everard Darcy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was the king gave it, Gleeson, it was the queen lost it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lands of Corrabeg, Dunragheedaghan, and Muscarooney, let at fifteen
      shillings an acre, with a right to cut turf on the Derryslattery bog! not
      to speak of Knocksadowd! lost, and no redemption!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Gleeson, that&rsquo;s the point I&rsquo;m coming to; there is a proviso in favor
      of redemption, whenever your grief will permit you to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gleeson gave a brief cough, blew his nose with considerable energy, and
      with an air of submissive sorrow apologized for yielding to his feelings.
      &ldquo;I have been so many years, sir, the guardian&mdash;if I may so say&mdash;of
      that property that I cannot think of being severed from its interests
      without deep, very deep, regret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! Gleeson, so do I! you have no monopoly of the sorrow, believe
      me. I acknowledge, readily, the full extent of my culpability. This
      foolish bet came to pass at a dinner at Hutchison&rsquo;s,&mdash;it was the
      crowning point of a bragging conversation about play,&mdash;and Drogheda,
      it seems, booked it, though I totally forgot all about it. I&rsquo;m certain he
      never intended to push the wager on me, but when reminded of it, of course
      I had nothing else for it but to express my readiness to meet him. I must
      say he behaved nobly all through; and even when Heffer-nan&rsquo;s stupid
      interruption had somewhat ruffled my nerves, he begged I would reconsider
      the card&mdash;he saw I had made a mistake&mdash;very handsome that!&mdash;his
      backers, I assure you, did not seem as much disposed to extend the
      courtesy. I relieved their minds, however, I stood by my play, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And lost an estate of three thousand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite correct; I&rsquo;m sure no man knows the rental better. And now, let us
      see how to keep it in the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stare of amazement with which Gleeson heard these words might have met
      a proposition far more extravagant still, and he repeated the speech to
      himself, as if weighing every syllable in a balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Gleeson, that was exactly what I said; now that we are engaged in
      liquidating, let us proceed with the good work. If I have given you
      enlarged occasion for the exercise of your abilities, I &lsquo;m only acting
      like Peter Henessy,&mdash;old Peter, that held the mill at Brown&rsquo;s Barn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The agent looked up with an expression in which all interest to learn the
      precedent alluded to was lost in astonishment at the levity of a man who
      could jest at such a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you never heard it, and, as the lawyers say, the rule will apply. I
      &lsquo;ll tell it to you. When Peter was dying, he sent for old Rush of the
      Priory to give him absolution; he would not have the parish priest, for he
      was a &lsquo;hard man,&rsquo; as Peter said, with little compassion for human
      weakness, never loved pork nor &lsquo;poteen,&rsquo; but seemed to have a relish for
      fasts and vigils. &lsquo;Rush will do,&rsquo; said he to all the family applications
      in favor of the other,&mdash;&lsquo;I &lsquo;ll have Father Rush;&rsquo; and so he had, and
      Rush came, and they were four hours at it, for Peter had a long score of
      reminiscences to bring up, and it was not without considerable difficulty,
      it is said, that Rush could apply the remedies of the Church to the
      various infractions of the old sinner. At last, however, it was arranged,
      and Peter lay back in bed very tired and fatigued; for, I assure you,
      Gleeson, whatever you may think of it, confessing one&rsquo;s iniquities is
      excessively wearying to the spirits. &lsquo;Is it all right, Father?&rsquo; said he,
      as the good priest counted over the roll of ragged bank-notes that were to
      be devoted to the purchase of different masses and offerings. &lsquo;It will do
      well,&rsquo; said Rush; &lsquo;make your mind easy, your peace is made now.&rsquo; &lsquo;And are
      you sure it&rsquo;s quite safe?&rsquo; said Peter; &lsquo;a pound more or less is nothing
      now compared to&mdash;what you know,&rsquo;&mdash;for Peter was polite, and
      followed the poet&rsquo;s counsel. &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis safe and sure both,&rsquo; said Rush; &lsquo;I have
      the whole of the sins under my thumb now, and don&rsquo;t fret yourself.&rsquo; &lsquo;Take
      another thirty shillings then, Father,&rsquo; said he, pushing the note over to
      him, &lsquo;and let Whaley have the two barrels of seed oats&mdash;the smut is
      in them, and they &lsquo;re not worth sixpence; but, when we are at it, Father,
      dear, let us do the thing complete: what signifies a trifle like that
      among the rest?&rsquo; Such was Peter&rsquo;s philosophy, Gleeson, and, if not very
      laudable as he applied it, it would seem to suit our present emergency
      remarkably well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gleeson vouchsafed but a very sickly smile as the Knight finished, and,
      taking up a bundle of papers from the table, proceeded to search for
      something amongst them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This loss was most inopportune, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt of it, Gleeson; it were far better had I won my wager,&rdquo; said the
      Knight, half testily; but the agent, scarce noticing the interruption,
      went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Lionel has drawn on me for seven hundred, and so late as Wednesday
      last I was obliged to meet a bill of his amounting to twelve hundred and
      eighty pounds. Thus, you will perceive that he has this year overdrawn his
      allowance considerably. He seems to have been as unlucky as yourself,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soft and silky as the accents were, there was a tincture of sarcasm in the
      way these words were uttered that did not escape Darcy&rsquo;s notice; but he
      made no reply, and appeared to listen attentively as the other resumed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, the expenses of the abbey have been enormous this year; you would
      scarcely credit the outlay for the hunting establishment; and, as I learn
      from Lady Eleanor that you rarely, if ever, take the field yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that, Gleeson,&rdquo; broke in the Knight, suddenly. &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll not sell
      a horse or part with a dog amongst them. My income must well be able to
      afford me the luxuries I have always been used to. I &lsquo;m not to be told
      that, with a rental of eighteen thousand a year&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rental, sir, I grant you,&rdquo; said Gleeson, interrupting him; &ldquo;you said
      quite correctly,&mdash;the rental is even more than you stated; but
      consider the charges on that rental,&mdash;the heavy sums raised on
      mortgages, the debt incurred by building, the two contested elections,
      your losses on the turf: these make sad inroads in the amount of your
      income.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you frankly, Gleeson,&rdquo; said the Knight, starting up and pacing the
      room with hasty steps, &ldquo;I &lsquo;ve neither head nor patience for details of
      this kind. I was induced to believe that my embarrassments, such as they
      are, were in course of liquidation; that by raising two hundred and fifty
      thousand pounds at four-and-a-half, or even five per cent, we should be
      enabled to clear off the heavy debts, for which we are paying ten, twelve,&mdash;ay,
      by Jove! I believe fifteen per cent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, I believe you do not exaggerate,&rdquo; said Gleeson, in a
      conciliating accent. &ldquo;Hickman&rsquo;s bond, though nominally bearing six per
      cent, is actually treble that sum. He holds &lsquo;The Grove&rsquo; at the rent of a
      cottier&rsquo;s tenure, and with the right of cutting timber in Clon-a-gauve
      wood,&mdash;a right he is by no means chary of exercising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be stopped, and at once,&rdquo; broke in Darcy, with a heightened
      color. &ldquo;The old man is actually making a clearing of the whole mountain
      side; the last time I was up there, Lionel and I counted two hundred and
      eighteen trees marked for the hatchet. I ordered Finn not to permit one of
      them to be touched; to go with a message from me to Hickman, saying that
      there was a wide difference between cutting timber for farm purposes and
      carrying on a trade in rivalry with the Baltic. Oaks of twenty, eighty,
      ay, a hundred and fifty years&rsquo; growth, the finest trees on the property,
      were among those I counted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did he desist, sir?&rdquo; asked Gleeson, with a half cunning look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he?&mdash;what a question you ask me! By Heavens! if he barked a
      sapling in that wood after my warning, I &lsquo;d have sent the Derrahinchy boys
      down to his place, and they would not have left a twig standing on his
      cockney territory. Devilish lucky he &lsquo;d be if they stopped there, and left
      him a house to shelter him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very unsafe enemy, sir,&rdquo; observed Gleeson, timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! Gleeson, I think you are bent on driving me distracted this
      morning. You have hit upon perhaps the only theme on which I cannot
      control my irritability, and I beg of you, once and for all, to change
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should never have alluded to Mr. Hickman, sir, but that I wished to
      remark to you that he is in a position which requires all our
      watchfulness; he has within the last three weeks bought up Drake&rsquo;s
      mortgage, and also Belson&rsquo;s bond for seventeen thousand, and, I know from
      a source of unquestionable accuracy, is at this moment negotiating for the
      purchase of Martin Hamilton&rsquo;s bond, amounting to twenty-one thousand more;
      so that, in fact, with the exception of that small debt to Batty and Rowe,
      he will remain the sole creditor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sole creditor!&rdquo; exclaimed Darcy, growing pale as marble,&mdash;&ldquo;Peter
      Hickman the sole creditor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, this privilege he will not long enjoy,&rdquo; said Gleeson, with a
      degree of alacrity he had not assumed before; &ldquo;when our arrangements are
      perfected with the London house of Bicknell and Jervis, we can pay off
      Hickman at once; he shall have a check for the whole amount the very same
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how soon may we hope for this happy event, Gleeson?&rdquo; cried the
      Knight, recovering his wonted voice and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not be distant now, sir; one of the deeds is ready at this
      moment, or at least will be to-morrow. On your signing it, we shall have
      some very trifling delays, and the money can be forthcoming by the end of
      the next week. The other will be perfected and compared by Wednesday
      week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that within three weeks, or a month at furthest, Gieeson, we shall
      have cut the cable with the old pirate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three weeks, I trust, will see all finished; that is, if this affair of
      Ballydermot does not interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall not do so,&rdquo; cried the Knight, resolutely; &ldquo;let it go. Drogheda
      is a gentleman at least, and if our old acres are to fall into other
      hands, let their possessor have blood in his veins, and he will not
      tyrannize over the people; but Hickman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very right, sir, Hickman might foreclose on the 24th of this month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gieeson, no more of this; I &lsquo;m not equal to it,&rdquo; said the Knight,
      faintly; and he sat down with a wearied sigh, and covered his face with
      his hands. The emotion, painful as it was, passed over soon, and the
      Knight, with a voice calm and measured as before, said, &ldquo;You will take
      care, Gieeson, that my son&rsquo;s bills are provided for; London is an
      expensive place, and particularly for a young fellow situated like Lionel;
      you may venture on a gentle&mdash;mind, a very gentle&mdash;remonstrance
      respecting his repeated calls for money; hint something about arrangements
      just pending, which require a little more prudence than usual. Do it
      cautiously, Gieeson; be very guarded. I remember when I was a young fellow
      being driven to the Jews by an old agent of my grandfather&rsquo;s; he wrote me
      a regular homily on thrift and economy, and to show I had benefited by the
      lesson, I went straightway and raised a loan at something very like sixty
      per cent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may rely upon my prudence, sir,&rdquo; said Gieeson. &ldquo;I think I can promise
      that Mr. Lionel will not take offence at my freedom. May I say Tuesday to
      wait on you with the deeds,&mdash;Tuesday morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, whenever you appoint, I &lsquo;ll be ready. I hoped to have left
      town this week; but these are too important matters to bear postponement.
      Tuesday, then, be it.&rdquo; And with a friendly shake-hands, they parted,&mdash;Gleeson,
      to the duties of his laborious life; the Knight, with a mind less at ease
      than was his wont, but still bearing no trace of discomposure on his manly
      and handsome countenance.

      CHAPTER XII. A FIRST VISIT
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever Captain Forester is quite able to bear the fatigue, Sullivan,&mdash;mind
      that you say &lsquo;quite able,&rsquo;&mdash;it will give me much pleasure to receive
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was the answer Lady Eleanor Darcy returned to a polite message from
      the young officer, expressing his desire to visit Lady Eleanor and thank
      her for the unwearied kindness she had bestowed on him during his illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Eleanor and her daughter were seated in the same chamber in which
      they have already been introduced to the reader. It was towards the close
      of a dark and gloomy day, the air heavy and overcast towards the land,
      while, over the sea, masses of black, misshapen cloud were drifted along
      hurriedly, the presage of a coming storm. The pine wood blazed brightly on
      the wide hearth, and threw its mellow lustre over the antique carvings and
      the porcelain ornaments of the chamber, contrasting the glow of in-door
      comfort with the bleak and cheerless look of all without, where the
      crashing noise of breaking branches mingled with the yet sadder sound of
      the swollen torrent from the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be remarked that persons who have lived much on the seaside, and
      near a coast abounding in difficulties or dangers, are far more
      susceptible of the influences of weather than those who pass their lives
      inland. Storm and shipwreck become, in a measure, inseparably associated.
      The loud beating of the waves upon the rocky shore, the deafening thunder
      of the swollen breakers, speak with a voice to <i>their</i> hearts, full
      of most meaning terror. The moaning accents of the spent wind, and the
      wailing cry of the petrel, awake thoughts of those who journey over &ldquo;the
      great waters,&rdquo; amid perils more dreadful than all of man&rsquo;s devising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Partly from these causes, partly from influences of a different kind, both
      mother and daughter felt unusually sad and depressed, and had sat for a
      long interval without speaking, when Forester&rsquo;s message was delivered,
      requesting leave to pay his personal respects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the visit been one of mere ceremony, Lady Eleanor would have declined
      it at once; her thoughts were wandering far away, engrossed by topics of
      dear and painful interest, and she would not have constrained herself to
      change their current and direction for an ordinary matter of conventional
      intercourse. But this was a different case; it was her son Lionel&rsquo;s
      friend, his chosen companion among his brother officers, the guest, too,
      who, wounded and almost dying beneath her roof, had been a charge of
      intense anxiety to her for weeks past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something strange, Helen, is there not, in this notion of
      acquaintanceship with one we have never seen; but now, after weeks of
      watching and inquiry, after nights of anxiety and days of care, I feel as
      if I ought to be very intimate with this same friend of Lionel&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more for that very reason, Mamma, and simply because he is Lionel&rsquo;s
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear child, not so; it is the tie that binds us to all for whom we
      have felt interested, and in whose sorrows we have taken a share. Lionel
      has doubtless many friends in his regiment, and yet it is very unlikely
      any of them would cause me even a momentary impatience to see and know
      what they are like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you confess to such in the present case?&rdquo; said Helen, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I own it, I have a strange feeling of half curiosity, and should be
      disappointed if the real Captain Forester does not come up to the standard
      of the ideal one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Forester, my Lady,&rdquo; said Sullivan, as he threw open the door of
      the apartment, and, with a step which all his efforts could not render
      firm, and a frame greatly reduced by suffering, he entered. So little was
      he prepared for the appearance of the ladies who now stood to receive him,
      that, despite his habitual tact, a slight expression of surprise marked
      his features, and a heightened color dyed his cheek as he saluted them in
      turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an air which perfectly blended kindliness and grace, Lady Eleanor
      held out her hand, and said, &ldquo;My daughter, Captain Forester;&rdquo; and then,
      pointing to a chair beside her own, begged of him to be seated. The
      unaccustomed exertion, the feeling of surprise, and the nervous
      irritability of convalescence, all conspired to make Forester ill at ease,
      and it was with a low, faint sigh he sank into the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had hoped, madam,&rdquo; said he, in a weak and tremulous accent,&mdash;&ldquo;I
      had hoped to be able to speak my gratitude to you,&mdash;to express at
      least some portion of what I feel for kindness to which I owe my life; but
      the greatness of the obligation would seem too much for such strength as
      mine. I must leave it to my mother to say how deeply your kindness has
      affected us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The accents in which these few words were uttered, particularly that which
      marked the mention of his mother, seemed to strike a chord in Lady
      Eleanor&rsquo;s heart, and her hand trembled as she took from Forester a sealed
      letter which he withdrew from another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julia Wallincourt,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, unconsciously reading half aloud
      the signature on the envelope of the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother, madam,&rdquo; said Forester, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Countess of Wallincourt!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Eleanor, with a heightened
      color and a look of excited and even anxious import.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam, the widowed Countess of the Earl of Wallincourt, late
      Ambassador at Madrid; am I to have the happiness of hearing that my mother
      is known to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had, sir, the pleasure,&mdash;the honor of meeting Lady Julia
      D&rsquo;Esterre; to have enjoyed that pleasure, even once, is quite enough never
      to forget it.&rdquo; Then, turning to her daughter, she added: &ldquo;You have often
      heard me speak of Lady Julia&rsquo;s beauty, Helen; she was certainly the most
      lovely person I ever saw, but the charm of her appearance was even
      inferior to the fascination of her manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She retains it all, madam,&rdquo; cried Forester, as his eyes sparkled with
      enthusiastic delight; &ldquo;she has lost nothing of that power of captivating;
      and as for beauty, I confess I know nothing higher in that quality than
      what conveys elevation of sentiment, with purity and tenderness of heart:
      this she possesses still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your elder brother, Captain Forester?&rdquo; inquired Lady Eleanor, with a
      manner intended to express interest, but in reality meant to direct the
      conversation into another channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in Spain still, madam; he was Secretary of the Embassy when my
      father died, and replaced him in the mission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, a long and chilling silence, after these words, that
      each party felt embarrassing, and yet were unable to break; at last
      Forester, turning towards Helen, asked &ldquo;when she had heard from her
      brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for some days past,&rdquo; replied she; &ldquo;but Lionel is such an irregular
      correspondent, we think nothing of his long intervals of silence. You have
      heard of his promotion, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; pray let me learn the good news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has got his company. Some very unexpected&mdash;I might say, from
      Lionel&rsquo;s account, some very inexplicable&mdash;piece of good fortune has
      aided his advancement, and he now writes himself, greatly to his own
      delight, it would appear, Captain Darcy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, with a look
      of pride, &ldquo;has been pleased to notice my son, and has appointed him an
      extra aide-de-camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; cried Forester; &ldquo;I am rejoiced at it, with all my heart. I
      always thought, if the Prince were to know him, he &lsquo;d be charmed with his
      agreeability. Lionel has the very qualities that win their way at Carlton
      House: buoyant spirit, courtly address, tact equal to any emergency,&mdash;all
      these are his; and the Prince likes to see handsome fellows about his
      Court. I am overjoyed at this piece of intelligence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a hearty frankness with which he spoke this that captivated both
      mother and daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are few more winning traits of human nature than the unaffected,
      heartfelt admiration of one young man for the qualities and endowments of
      another, and never are they more likely to meet appreciation than when
      exhibited in presence of the mother of the lauded one. And thus the simple
      expression of Forester&rsquo;s delight at his friend&rsquo;s advancement went further
      to exalt himself in the good graces of Lady Eleanor than the display of
      any powers of pleasing, however ingeniously or artfully exercised.
    </p>
    <p>
      As through the openings of a dense wood we come unexpectedly upon a view
      of a wide tract of country, unfolding features of landscape unthought of
      and unlooked for, so occasionally doth it happen that, in conversation, a
      chance allusion, a mere word, will develop sources of interest buried up
      to that very moment, and display themes of mutual enjoyment which were
      unknown before. This was now the case. Lionel&rsquo;s name, which evoked the
      mother&rsquo;s pride and the sister&rsquo;s affection, called also into play the
      generous warmth of Forester&rsquo;s attachment to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus pleasantly glided on the hours, and none remarked how time was
      passing, or even heeded the howling storm that raged without, while
      anecdotes and traits of Lionel were recorded, and comments passed upon his
      character and temper such as a friend might utter and a mother love to
      hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Forester rose. More than once during the interview a consciousness
      crossed his mind that he was outstaying the ordinary limits of a visit;
      but at each moment some observation of Lady Eleanor or her daughter, or
      some newly remembered incident in Lionel&rsquo;s career, would occur, and delay
      his departure. At last he stood up, and, warned by the thickening darkness
      of how time had sped, was endeavoring to mutter some words of apology,
      when Lady Eleanor interrupted him with,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray do not let us suppose you felt the hours too long, Captain Forester;
      the theme you selected will always make my daughter and myself insensible
      to the lapse of time. If I did not fear we should be trespassing on both
      your kindness and health together, I should venture to request you would
      dine with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forester&rsquo;s sparkling eyes and flushed cheek replied to the invitation
      before he had words to say how gladly he accepted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel more reconciled to making this request, sir,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor,
      &ldquo;because in your present state of weakness you cannot enjoy the society of
      a pleasanter party, and it is a fortunate thing that you can combine a
      prudent action with a kind one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forester appreciated the flattery of the remark, and, with a broken
      acknowledgment of its import, moved towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, &ldquo;pray don&rsquo;t think of dressing; you have all
      the privilege of an invalid, and a&mdash;friend also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pause which preceded the word brought a slight blush into her cheek,
      but when it was uttered, she seemed to have resumed her self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall leave you now with the newspapers, which I suppose you are
      longing to look at, and join you at the dinner-table.&rdquo; And as she spoke,
      she took her daughter&rsquo;s arm and passed into an adjoining room, leaving
      Forester in one of those pleasant reveries which so often break in upon
      the hours of returning health, and compensate for all the sufferings of a
      sick-bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange and how unceasing are the anomalies of Irish life!&rdquo; thought
      he, as he sat alone, ruminating on the past. &ldquo;Splendor, poverty, elevation
      of sentiment, savage ferocity, delicacy the most refined, barbarism the
      most revolting, pass before the mind&rsquo;s eye in the quick succession of the
      objects in a magic lantern. Here, in these few weeks, what characters and
      incidents have been revealed to me! and how invariably have I found myself
      wrong in every effort to decipher them! Nor are the indications of mind
      and temper in themselves so very singular, as the fact of meeting them
      under circumstances and in situations so unlikely. For instance, who would
      have expected to see a Lady Eleanor Darcy here, in this wild region, with
      all the polished grace and dignity of manner the best circles alone
      possess; and her daughter, haughtier, perhaps, than the mother, more
      reserved, more timid it may be, and yet with all the elegance of a Court
      in every gesture and every movement. Lionel told me she was handsome,&mdash;he
      might have said downright beautiful. Where were these, fascinations
      nurtured and cultivated? Is it here, on the margin of this lonely bay,
      amid scenes of reckless dissipation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of this kind were his musings; nor, amid them all, did one thought obtrude
      of the cause which threw him first into such companionship, nor of that
      mission, to discharge which was the end and object of his coming.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. A TREATY REJECTED
    </h2>
    <p>
      Forester&rsquo;s recovery was slow, at least so his friends in the capital
      thought it, for to each letter requiring to know when he might be expected
      back again, the one reply forever was returned, &ldquo;As soon as he felt able
      to leave Gwynne Abbey.&rdquo; Nor was the answer, perhaps, injudiciously
      couched.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the evening of his first introduction to Lady Eleanor and her
      daughter, his visits were frequent, sometimes occupying the entire
      morning, and always prolonged far into the night. Never did an intimacy
      make more rapid progress; so many tastes and so many topics were in common
      to all, for while the ladies had profited by reading and study in matters
      which he had little cultivated, yet the groundwork of an early good
      education enabled him to join in discussions, and take part in
      conversation which both interested at the time, and suggested improvement
      afterward; and if Lady Eleanor knew less of the late events which formed
      the staple of London small-talk, she was well informed on the characters
      and passages of the early portion of the reign, which gave all the charm
      of a history to reminiscences purely personal.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the wits and distinguished men of that day she had lived in great
      intimacy, and felt a pride in contrasting the displays of intellectual
      wealth, so common then, with the flatter and more prosaic habita since
      introduced into society. &ldquo;Eccentricities and absurdities,&rdquo; she would say,
      &ldquo;have replaced in the world the more brilliant exhibitions of cultivated
      and gifted minds, and I must confess to preferring the social qualities of
      Horace Walpole to the exaggerations of Bagenal Daly, or the ludicrous
      caprices of Buck Whaley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Mr. Daly charming, for my part,&rdquo; said Helen, laughing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      certain that he is a miracle of truth, as he is of adventure; if
      everything he relates is not strictly accurate and matter of fact, it is
      because the real is always inferior to the ideal. The things <i>ought</i>
      to have happened as he states.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, at least, <i>ben trovato</i>,&rdquo; broke in Forester; &ldquo;yet I go
      further, and place perfect confidence in his narratives, and truly I have
      heard some strange ones in our morning rides together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspected as much,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, &ldquo;a new listener is such a boon
      to him; so, then, you have heard how he carried away the Infanta of Spain,
      compelled the Elector of Saxony to take off his boots, made the Doge of
      Venice drunk, and instructed the Pasha of Trebizond in the mysteries of an
      Irish jig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word of these have I heard as yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! then what, in all mercy, has he been talking of,&mdash;India,
      China, or North America, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still less; he has never wandered from Ireland and Irish life, and I must
      say, as far as adventure and incident are concerned, it would have been
      quite unnecessary for him to have strayed beyond it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are perfectly right there,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, with some seriousness
      in the tone; &ldquo;our home anomalies may shame all foreign wonders: he himself
      could scarcely find his parallel in any land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a sincere affection for Lionel, Mamma,&rdquo; said Helen, in an accent
      of deprecating meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that very same regard gave the bias to Lionel&rsquo;s taste for every
      species of absurdity! Believe me, Helen, Irish blood is too stimulating an
      ingredient to enter into a family oftener than once in four generations.
      Mr. Daly&rsquo;s has been unadulterated for centuries, and the consequence is,
      that, although neither deficient in strong sense or quick perception, he
      acts always on the impulse that precedes judgment, and both his generosity
      and his injustice outrun the mark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love that same rash temperament,&rdquo; said Helen, flushing as she spoke;
      &ldquo;it is a fine thing to see so much of warm and generous nature survive all
      that he must have seen of the littleness of mankind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! Captain Forester, there! Have I not reason on my side? You thought
      me very unjust towards poor Mr. Daly,&mdash;I know you did; but it demands
      all my watchfulness to prevent him being equally the model for my
      daughter, as he is for my son&rsquo;s imitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are traits in his character any might well be proud to imitate,&rdquo;
       said Helen, warmly; &ldquo;his life has been a series of generous, single-minded
      actions; and,&rdquo; added she, archly &ldquo;if Mamma thinks it prudent and safe to
      warn her children against some of Mr. Daly&rsquo;s eccentricities, no one is
      more ready to acknowledge his real worth than she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen is right,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor; &ldquo;if we could always be certain that
      Mr. Daly&rsquo;s imitators would copy the truly great features of his character,
      we might forgive them falling into his weaknesses; and now, can any one
      tell me why we have not seen him for some days past? He is in the Abbey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we rode out together yesterday morning to look at the wreck near the
      Sound of Achill; strange enough, I only learned from a chance remark of
      one of the sailors that Daly had been in the boat, the night before, that
      took the people off the wreck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So like him!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen, with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is angry with me, I know he is,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, musingly. &ldquo;I asked
      his advice respecting the answer I should send to a certain letter, and
      then rejected the counsel. He would have forgiven me had I run counter to
      his opinions without asking; but when I called him into consultation, the
      offence became a grave one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, Mamma, I side with him; his arguments were clear, strong, and
      unanswerable, and the best proof of it is, you have never had the courage
      to follow your own determination since you listened to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a great mind to choose an umpire between us. What say you, Captain
      Forester, will you hear the case? Helen shall take Mr. Daly&rsquo;s side; I will
      make my own statement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a novel idea,&rdquo; said Helen, laughing, &ldquo;that the umpire should be
      selected by one of the litigating parties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you doubt my impartiality, Miss Darcy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am to accept you as a judge, I &lsquo;ll not prejudice the Court against
      myself, by avowing my opinions of it,&rdquo; said she, archly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I spoke of your arbitration, Captain Forester,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor,
      &ldquo;I really meant fairly, for upon all the topics we have discussed
      together, politics, or anything bordering on political opinions, have
      never come uppermost; and, up to this moment, I have not the slightest
      notion what are your political leanings, Whig or Tory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the point in dispute is a political one?&rdquo; asked Forester, cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; interposed Helen; &ldquo;the policy of a certain reply to a
      certain demand is the question at issue; but the advice of any party in
      the matter might be tinged by his party leanings, if he have any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I judge Captain Forester aright, he has troubled his head very little
      about party squabbles,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor; &ldquo;and in any case, he can
      scarcely take a deep interest in a question which is almost peculiarly
      Irish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forester bowed,&mdash;partly in pretended acquiescence of this speech,
      partly to conceal a deep flush that mounted suddenly to his cheek; for he
      felt by no means pleased at a remark that might be held to reflect on his
      political knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be thou the judge, then,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor. &ldquo;And, first of all, read
      that letter.&rdquo; And she took from her work-box her cousin Lord Netherby&rsquo;s
      letter, and handed it to Forester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reserve my right to dispute that document being evidence,&rdquo; said Helen,
      laughing; &ldquo;nor is there any proof of the handwriting being Lord
      Netherby&rsquo;s. Mamma herself acknowledges she has not heard from him for
      nearly twenty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This cunning speech, meant to intimate the precise relation of the two
      parties, was understood at once by Forester, who could with difficulty
      control a smile, although Lady Eleanor looked far from pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was now a pause, while Forester read over the long letter with due
      attention, somewhat puzzled to conceive to what particular portion of it
      the matter in dispute referred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not read the postscript,&rdquo; said Helen, as she saw him folding the
      letter, without remarking the few concluding lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forester twice read over the passage alluded to, and at once whatever had
      been mysterious or difficult was revealed before him. Lord Netherby&rsquo;s wily
      temptation was made manifest, not the less palpably, perhaps, because the
      reader was himself involved in the very same scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have now seen my cousin&rsquo;s letter,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, &ldquo;and the whole
      question is whether the reply should be limited to a suitable
      acknowledgment of its kind expressions, and a grateful sense of the
      Prince&rsquo;s condescension, or should convey&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma means,&rdquo; interrupted Helen, laughingly,&mdash;&ldquo;Mamma means, that we
      might also avow our sincere gratitude for the rich temptation offered in
      requital of my father&rsquo;s vote on the &lsquo;nion.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No minister would dare to make such a proposition to the Knight of
      Gwynne,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ministers are very enterprising nowadays, Mamma,&rdquo; rejoined Helen; &ldquo;I have
      never heard any one speak of Mr. Pitt&rsquo;s cowardice, and Lord Castlereagh
      has had courage to invite old Mr. Hickman to dinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forester would gladly have acknowledged his relationship to the Secretary,
      but the moment seemed unpropitious, and the avowal would have had the
      semblance of a rebuke; so he covered his confusion by a laugh, and said
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can scarcely contemn the hardihood of a Government that has made
      Crofton a bishop, and Hawes a general,&rdquo; said Helen, with a flashing eye
      and a lip curled in superciliousness. &ldquo;Nothing short of a profound
      reliance on the piety of the Church and the bravery of the Army would
      support such a policy as that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Eleanor seemed provoked at the hardy tone of Helen&rsquo;s speech; but the
      mother&rsquo;s look was proud, as she gazed on the brilliant expression of her
      daughter&rsquo;s beauty, now heightened by the excitement of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not possible, Miss Darcy,&rdquo; said Forester, in a voice at once timid
      and insinuating,&mdash;&ldquo;is it not possible that the measure contemplated
      by the Government may have results so beneficial as to more than
      compensate for evils like these?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Jesuit, or a Tory, or both,&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;Mamma, you have chosen your
      umpire most judiciously; his is exactly the impartiality needed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but hear me out,&rdquo; cried the young officer, whose cheek was crimsoned
      with shame. &ldquo;If the measure be a good one,&mdash;well, let me beg the
      question, if it be a good one&mdash;and yet, the time for propounding it
      is either inopportune or unfortunate, and, consequently, the support it
      might claim on its own merits be withheld either from prejudice, party
      connection, or any similar cause,&mdash;you would not call a ministry
      culpable who should anticipate the happy working of a judicious Act, by
      securing the assistance of those whose convictions are easily won over, in
      preference to the slower process of convincing the men of more upright and
      honest intentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have begged so much in the commencement, and assumed so much in the
      conclusion, sir, that I am at a loss to which end of your speech to
      address my answer; but I will say this much: it is but sorry evidence of a
      measure&rsquo;s goodness when it can only meet with the approval of the venal. I
      don&rsquo;t prize the beauty so highly that is only recognized by the blind
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Distorted vision, Miss Darcy, may lead to impressions more erroneous than
      even blindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may have the infirmity you speak of,&rdquo; said she, quickly, &ldquo;but assuredly
      I&rsquo;ll not wear Government spectacles to correct it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Forester was surprised at finding a young lady so deeply interested in
      a political question, he was still more so on hearing the tone of
      determination she spoke in, and would gladly, had he known how, have given
      the conversation a less serious turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been all the time forgetting the real question at issue,&rdquo; said
      Lady Eleanor. &ldquo;I &lsquo;m sure I never intended to listen to a discussion on the
      merits or demerits of the Union, on which you both grow so eloquent; will
      you then kindly return to whence we started, and advise me as to the reply
      to this letter.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not perceive any remarkable difficulty, madam,&rdquo; said Forester,
      addressing himself exclusively to Lady Eleanor. &ldquo;The Knight of Gwynne has
      doubtless strong opinions on this question; they are either in favor of,
      or adverse to, the Government views: if the former, your reply is easy and
      most satisfactory; if the latter, perhaps he would condescend to explain
      the nature of his objections, to state whether it be to anything in the
      detail of the measure he is adverse to, or to the principle of the Bill
      itself. A declaration like this will open a door to negotiation, without
      the slightest imputation on either side. A minister may well afford to
      offer his reasons for any line of policy to one as eminent in station and
      ability as the Knight of Gwynne, and I trust I am not indiscreet in
      assuming that the Knight would not be derogating from that station in
      listening to, and canvassing, such explanations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Castlereagh, &lsquo;aut&mdash;-,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Helen, starting up from her seat,
      and making a low courtesy before Forester, who, feeling himself in a
      measure detected, blushed till his face became scarlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Helen, at this rate we shall never&mdash;But what is this?&mdash;who
      have we here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sudden exclamation was caused by the appearance of a small
      four-wheeled carriage drawn up at the gate of the flower-garden, from
      which old Hickman&rsquo;s voice could now be heard, inquiring if Lady Eleanor
      were at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sullivan,&rdquo; said she, with a sigh, &ldquo;and order luncheon.&rdquo; Then, as the
      servant left the room, she added, &ldquo;I am always better pleased when the
      visits of that family are paid by the old gentleman, whom I prefer to the
      son or the grandson. They are better performers, I admit, but he is an
      actor of nature&rsquo;s own making.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know him, Captain Forester?&rdquo; asked Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, before he could reply, the door was opened, and Sullivan announced,
      by his ancient title, &ldquo;Doctor Hickman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strange and grotesque as in every respect he looked, the venerable
      character of old age secured him a respectful, almost a cordial,
      reception; and as Lady Eleanor advanced to him, there was that urbanity
      and courtesy in her manner which are so nearly allied to the expression of
      actual esteem. It was true, there was little in the old man&rsquo;s nature to
      elicit such feelings towards him; he was a grasping miser, covetousness
      and money-getting filled up his heart, and every avenue leading to it. The
      passion for gain had alone given the interest to his life, and developed
      into activity any intelligence he possessed. While his son valued wealth
      as the only stepping-stone to a position of eminence and rank, old Hickman
      loved riches for their own sake. The bank was, in his estimation, the
      fountain of all honor, and a strong credit there better than all the
      reputation the world could confer. These were harsh traits. But then he
      was old; long years of infirmity were bringing him each hour closer to the
      time when the passion of his existence must be abandoned; and a feeling of
      pity was excited at the sight of that withered, careworn face, to which
      the insensate cravings of avarice lent an unnatural look of shrewdness and
      intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a cold morning for your drive, Mr. Hickman,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor,
      kindly. &ldquo;Captain Forester, may I ask you to stir the fire? Mr. Hickman&mdash;Captain
      Forester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Miss Helen, beautiful as ever!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man, as, with a
      look of real admiration, he gazed on Miss Darcy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it is,
      Lady Eleanor, but the young ladies never dressed so becomingly formerly.
      Captain Forester, your humble servant; I&rsquo;m glad to see you about again,&mdash;indeed,
      I did n&rsquo;t think it very likely once that you&rsquo;d ever leave the library on
      your own feet; Mac-Donough &lsquo;s a dead shot they tell me&mdash;ay, ay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope your friends at &lsquo;The Grove&rsquo; are well, sir?&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor,
      desirous of interrupting a topic she saw to be particularly distressing to
      Forester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, my Lady; my son Bob&mdash;Mr. Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly, I mean&mdash;God
      forgive me, I&rsquo;m sure they take trouble enough to teach me that name&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      got a kind of a water-brash, what we call a pyrosis. I tell him it&rsquo;s the
      French dishes he eats for dinner, things he never was brought op to,
      concoctions of lemon juice, and cloves, and saffron, and garlic, in meat
      roasted&mdash;no, but stewed into chips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You prefer our national cookery, Mr. Hickman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my Lady, with the gravy in it; the crag-end,&mdash;if your Ladyship
      knows what&rsquo;s the crag-end of a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Mr. Hickman,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, smiling, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m deplorably
      ignorant about everything that concerns the household. Helen affects to be
      very deep in these matters; but I suspect it is only a superficial
      knowledge, got up to amuse the Knight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg, Mamma, you will not infer any such reproach on my skill in <i>menage</i>.
      Papa called my <i>omelette à la curé</i> perfect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to hear Mr. Hickman&rsquo;s judgment on it,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor,
      with a sly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a plain joint, my Lady, boiled or roasted, without spices or
      devilment in it, but just the way Providence intended&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask, sir, how you suppose Providence intended to recommend any
      particular kind of cookery?&rdquo; said Helen, seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever is most natural, most simple, the easiest to do,&rdquo; stammered out
      Hickman, not over pleased at being asked for an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the Cossack ranks first in the art,&rdquo; exclaimed Forester; &ldquo;for
      nothing can be more simple or easier than to take a slice of a live ox and
      hang it up in the sun for ten or fifteen minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them&rsquo;s barbarians,&rdquo; said Hickman, with an emphasis that made the
      listeners find it no easy task to keep down a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luncheon, my Lady,&rdquo; said old Tate Sullivan, as with a reverential bow he
      opened the folding-doors into a small breakfast parlor, where an
      exquisitely served table was laid out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Practice before precept, Mr. Hickman,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor; &ldquo;will you join
      us at luncheon, where I hope you may find something to your liking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the old man seated himself at the table, his eye ranged over the
      cabinet pictures that covered the walls, the richly chased silver on the
      table, and the massive wine-coolers that stood on the sideboard, with an
      eye whose brilliancy betokened far more the covetous taste of the miser
      than the pleased expression of mere connoisseurship; nor could he recall
      himself from their admiration to hear Forester&rsquo;s twice-repeated question
      as to what he would eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;T is elegant fine plate, no doubt of it,&rdquo; muttered he, below his breath;
      &ldquo;and the pictures may be worth as much more&mdash;ay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last monosyllable was the only part of his speech audible, and being
      interpreted by Forester as a reply to his request, he at once helped the
      old gentleman to a very highly seasoned French dish before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; said Hickman, as he surveyed his plate with unfeigned
      astonishment; &ldquo;if I did n&rsquo;t see it laid down on your Ladyship&rsquo;s table, I
      &lsquo;d swear it was a bit of Gal way marble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a <i>gélatine truffée</i>, Mr. Hickman,&rdquo; said Forester, who was well
      aware of its merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so, in the name of God!&rdquo; said Hickman, with resignation, as though
      to say that any one who could eat it might take the trouble to learn the
      name. &ldquo;Ay, my Lady, that &lsquo;s what I like, a slice of Kerry beef,&mdash;a
      beast made for man&rsquo;s eating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hickman&rsquo;s pony is more of an epicure than his master,&rdquo; said Forester,
      as he arose from his chair and moved towards the glass-door that opened on
      the garden; &ldquo;he has just eaten the top of your lemon-tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by way of dessert, he is now cropping my japonica,&rdquo; cried Helen, as
      she sprang from the room to rescue her favorite plant. Forester followed
      her, and Lady Eleanor was left alone with the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my Lady, that I have the opportunity,&mdash;and sure it was luck
      gave it to me,&mdash;would you give me the favor of a little private
      conversation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the matter be on business, Mr. Hickman, I must frankly own I should
      prefer your addressing yourself to the Knight; he will be home early next
      week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is&mdash;and it is not, my Lady&mdash;but, there! they&rsquo;re coming back,
      now, and it is too late;&rdquo; and so he heaved a heavy sigh, and lay back in
      his chair, as though worn out and disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, in the library, Mr. Hickman,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor,
      compassionately, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;ve eaten some luncheon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more, my Lady; &lsquo;tis elegant fine beef as ever I tasted, and the gravy
      in it, but I&rsquo;m not hungry now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Eleanor, without a guess as to what might form the subject of his
      communication, perceived that he was agitated and anxious; and so,
      requesting Forester and her daughter to continue their luncheon, she
      added: &ldquo;And I have something to tell Mr. Hickman, if he will give five
      minutes of his company in the next room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taking a chair near the fire, Lady Eleanor motioned to the doctor to be
      seated; but the old man was so engaged in admiring the room and its
      furniture that he seemed insensible to all else. As his eye wandered over
      the many objects of taste and luxury on every side, his lips muttered
      unceasingly, but the sound was inarticulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot pledge myself that we shall remain long uninterrupted, Mr.
      Hickman,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, &ldquo;so pray lose no time in the communication
      you have to make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I humbly ask pardon, my Lady,&rdquo; said the old man, in a voice of deep
      humility; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m old and feeble now, and my senses none of the clearest,&mdash;but
      sure it&rsquo;s time for them to be worn out; ninety-one I &lsquo;ll be, if I live to
      Lady-day.&rdquo; It was his habit to exaggerate his age; besides, there was a
      tremulous pathos in his accents to which Lady Eleanor was far from feeling
      insensible, and she awaited in silence what was to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; sighed the old man, &ldquo;if I succeed in this, the last act of
      my long life, I &lsquo;m well content to go whenever the Lord pleases.&rdquo; And so
      saying, he took from his coat-pocket the ominous-looking old leather case
      to which we have already alluded, and searched for some time amid its
      contents. &ldquo;Ay! here it is&mdash;that is it&mdash;it is only a memorandum,
      my Lady, but it will show what I mean.&rdquo; And he handed the paper to Lady
      Eleanor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some time before she had arranged her spectacles and adjusted
      herself to peruse the document; but before she had concluded, her hand
      trembled violently, and all color forsook her cheek. Meanwhile; the doctor
      sat with his filmy eyes directed towards her, as if watching the working
      of his spell; and when the paper fell from her fingers, he uttered a low
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; as though to say his success was certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred thousand pounds!&rdquo; exclaimed she, with a shudder; &ldquo;this cannot
      be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all true, my Lady, and so is this too;&rdquo; and he took from his hat a
      newspaper and presented it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Ballydermot property! The whole estate lost at cards! This is a
      calumny, sir,&mdash;the libellous impertinence of a newspaper
      paragraphist. I&rsquo;ll not believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;T &lsquo;s true, notwithstanding, my Lady. Harvey Dawson was there himself,
      and saw it all; and as for the other, the deeds and mortgages are at this
      moment in the hands of my son&rsquo;s solicitor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this may be foreclosed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the 24th, at noon, my Lady,&rdquo; continued Hickman, as he folded the
      memorandum and replaced it in his pocket-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said she, as, with a great effort to master her emotion, she
      addressed him in a steady and even commanding voice, &ldquo;the next thing is to
      learn what are your intentions respecting this debt? You have not
      purchased all these various liabilities of my husband&rsquo;s without some
      definite object. Speak it out&mdash;what is it? Has Mr. Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s
      ambition increased so rapidly that he desires to date his letters from
      Gwynne Abbey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Saints forbid it, my Lady,&rdquo; said the old man, with a pious horror. &ldquo;I
      &lsquo;d never come here this day on such an errand as that. If it was not to
      propose what was agreeable, you &lsquo;d not see me here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, what is the proposition? Let me hear it at once, for my
      patience never bears much dallying with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming to it, my Lady,&rdquo; muttered Hickman, who already felt really
      ashamed at the deep emotion his news evoked. &ldquo;There are two ways of doing
      it&mdash;&rdquo; A gesture of impatience from Lady Eleanor stopped him, but,
      after a brief pause, he resumed: &ldquo;Bear with me, my Lady. Old age and
      infirmity are always prolix; but I&rsquo;ll do my best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would be as unfair a trial of the reader&rsquo;s endurance as it proved to
      Lady Eleanor&rsquo;s, were we to relate the slow steps by which Mr. Hickman
      announced his plan, the substance of which, divested of all his own
      circumlocution and occasional interruptions, was simply this: a promise
      had been made by Lord Castlereagh to Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly that if, through his
      influence, exercised by means of moneyed arrangements or otherwise, the
      Knight of Gwynne would vote with the Government on the &ldquo;Union,&rdquo; he should
      be elevated to the Peerage, an object which, however inconsiderable in the
      old man&rsquo;s esteem, both his son and grandson had set their hearts upon. For
      this service they, in requital, would extend the loan to another period of
      seven years, stipulating only for some trifling advantages regarding the
      right of cutting timber, some coast fisheries, and other matters to be
      mentioned afterwards,&mdash;points which, although evidently of minor
      importance, were recapitulated by the old man with a circumstantial
      minuteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only by a powerful effort that Lady Eleanor could control her
      rising indignation at this proposal, while the very thought of Hickman
      O&rsquo;Reilly as a Peer, and member of that proud &ldquo;Order&rdquo; of which her own
      haughty family formed a part, was an insult almost beyond endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, sir,&rdquo; said she, with a forced composure which deceived old Hickman
      completely, and made him suppose that his negotiation was proceeding
      favorably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m sure, my Lady, it &lsquo;s little satisfaction all this grandeur would
      give me. I &lsquo;d rather be twenty years younger, and in the back parlor of my
      old shop at Loughrea than the first peer in the kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ambition is not your failing, then, sir,&rdquo; said she, with a glance which,
      to one more quick-sighted, would have conveyed the full measure of her
      scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it is n&rsquo;t, my Lady; but they insist upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is the Peerage to be enriched by the enrolment of your name among its
      members? I thought, sir, it was your son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob&mdash;Mr. Hickman, I mean&mdash;suggests that I should be the first
      lord in the family, my Lady, because then Beecham&rsquo;s title won&rsquo;t seem so
      new when it comes to him. &lsquo;T is the only use they can make of me now&mdash;ay!&rdquo;
       and the word was accented with a venomous sharpness that told the secret
      anger he had himself awakened by his remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Knight of Gwynne,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, proudly, &ldquo;has often regretted
      to me the few opportunities he had embraced through life of serving his
      country; I have no doubt, sir, when he hears your proposal, that he will
      rejoice at this occasion of making an <i>amende</i>. I will write to him
      by this post. Is there anything more you wish to add, Mr. Hickman?&rdquo; said
      she, as, having risen from her chair, she perceived that the old man
      remained seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, my Lady, there is, and I don&rsquo;t think I &lsquo;d have the heart for
      it, if it was n&rsquo;t your Ladyship&rsquo;s kindness about the other business; and
      even now, maybe, it would take you by surprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can scarcely do that, sir, after what I have just listened to,&rdquo; said
      she, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there &lsquo;s no use in going round about the bush, and this is what I
      mean. We thought there might be a difficulty, perhaps, about the vote;
      that the Knight might have promised his friends, or said something or
      other how he &lsquo;d go, and would n&rsquo;t be able to get out of it so easily, so
      we saw another way of serving his views about the money. You see, my Lady,
      we considered it all well amongst us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should feel deeply grateful, sir, to know how far this family has
      occupied your kind solicitude. But proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the Knight does n&rsquo;t like to vote with the Government, of course there
      is no use in Bob doing it; so he &lsquo;ll be a Patriot, my Lady,&mdash;and why
      not? Ha! ha! ha! they &lsquo;ll be breaking the windows all over Dublin, and he
      may as well save the glass!&mdash;ay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, sir, if I cannot see how this has any reference to my
      family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to it&mdash;coming fast, my Lady. We were thinking then how we
      could help the Knight, and do a good turn to ourselves; and the way we hit
      upon was this: to reduce the interest on the whole debt to five per cent,
      make a settlement of half the amount on Miss Darcy, and then, if the young
      lady had no objection to my grandson, Beecham&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, sir,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor; &ldquo;I never could suppose you meant to offend
      me intentionally,&mdash;I cannot permit of your doing so through
      inadvertence or ignorance. I will therefore request that this conversation
      may cease. Age has many privileges, Mr. Hickman, but there are some it can
      never confer: one of these is the right to insult a lady and&mdash;a
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last words were sobbed rather than spoken: affection and pride, both
      outraged together, almost choked her utterance, and Lady Eleanor sat down
      trembling in every limb, while the old man, only half conscious of the
      emotion he had evoked, peered at her in stolid amazement through his
      spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any one who knew nothing of old Hickman&rsquo;s character might well have pitied
      his perplexity at that moment; doubts of every kind and sort passed
      through his mind as rapidly as his timeworn faculties permitted, and at
      last he settled down into the conviction that Lady Eleanor might have
      thought his demand respecting fortune too exorbitant, although not deeming
      the proposition, in other respects, ineligible. To this conclusion the
      habits of his own mind insensibly disposed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, my Lady,&rdquo; said he, after a pause, &ldquo;&lsquo;tis a deal of money, no doubt;
      but it won&rsquo;t be going out of the family, and that&rsquo;s more than could be
      said if you refuse the offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Eleanor, in a tone that to any one less obtusely
      endowed would have been an appeal not requiring repetition; but the old
      man had only senses for his own views, and went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me that Mr. Lionel is just as free with his money as his
      father; throws it out with both hands, horse-racing and high play, and
      every extravagance he can think of. Well, and if that&rsquo;s true, my Lady,
      sure it &lsquo;s well worth while to think that you &lsquo;ll have a decent house to
      put your head under when your daughter&rsquo;s married to Beecham. He has no
      wasteful ways, but can look after the main chance as well as any boy ever
      I seen. This notion about Miss Helen is the only thing like expense I ever
      knew him take up, and sure&rdquo;&mdash;here he dropped his voice to soliloquy&mdash;&ldquo;sure,
      maybe, that same will pay well, after all&mdash;ay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My head! my head is bursting with blood,&rdquo; sighed Lady Eleanor; but the
      last words alone reached Hickman&rsquo;s ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! blood&rsquo;s a fine thing, no doubt of it, but, faith, it won&rsquo;t pay
      interest on a mortgage; nor I never heard of it staying the execution of a
      writ! &lsquo;T is little good blood I had in my veins, and yet I contrived to
      scrape a trifle together notwithstanding&mdash;ay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not feel myself very well, Mr. Hickman,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor; &ldquo;may I
      request you will send my daughter to me, and excuse me if I wish you a
      good morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I hint anything to the young lady about what we were saying?&rdquo; said
      he, in a tone of most confidential import.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your peril, sir!&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, with a look that at once seemed
      to transfix him; and the old man, muttering his adieu, hobbled from the
      room, while Lady Eleanor leaned back in her chair, overcome by the
      conflict of her emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he gone?&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, faintly, as her daughter entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mamma; but are you ill? You look dreadfully pale and agitated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wearied&mdash;fatigued, my dear, nothing more. Tell Captain Forester I
      must release him from his engagement to us to-day; I cannot come to
      dinner.&rdquo; And, so saying, she covered her eyes with her hand, and seemed
      lost in deep thought.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. &ldquo;THE MECHANISM OP CORRUPTION&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Heffernan,&rdquo; said Lord Castlereagh, as they sat over their wine
      alone in a small dining-room of the Secretary&rsquo;s Lodge,&mdash;&ldquo;well, even
      with Hackett, we shall be run close. I don&rsquo;t fancy the thought of another
      division so nearly matched; our fellows don&rsquo;t see the honor of a
      Thermopylae.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, my Lord; and the desertions are numerous, as they always will
      be when men receive the bounty before they are enlisted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but what would you do? We make a man a Commissioner or a sinecurist
      for his vote,&mdash;he vacates his seat on taking office; and, instead of
      standing the brunt of another election, coolly says, &lsquo;That, differing as
      he must do from his constituents on an important measure, he restores the
      trust they had committed into his hands&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He hopes unsullied,&rsquo;&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget that, my Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&mdash;&lsquo;he hopes unsullied,&mdash;and prefers to retire from the
      active career of politics, carrying with him the esteem and regard of his
      former friends, rather than endanger their good opinion by supporting
      measures to which they are conscientiously opposed.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felicitous conjuncture, that unites patriotism and profit!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Heffernan. &ldquo;Happy man, that can draw tears from the Mob, and two thousand
      a year from the Treasury!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet I see no remedy for it,&rdquo; sighed the Secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one, notwithstanding; but it demands considerable address and
      skill. You have always been too solicitous about the estimation of the men
      you bought were held in,&mdash;always thinking of what would be said and
      thought of them. You pushed the system so far that the fellows themselves
      caught up the delusion, and began to fancy they had characters to lose.
      All this was wrong,&mdash;radically, thoroughly wrong. When the butcher
      smears a red streak round a lamb&rsquo;s neck,&mdash;we call it &lsquo;raddling&rsquo; in
      Ireland, my Lord,&mdash;any child knows he &lsquo;s destined for the knife; now,
      when you &lsquo;raddled&rsquo; your flock, you wanted the world to believe you were
      going to make pets of them, and you said as much, and so often that the
      beasts themselves believed it, and began cutting their gambols
      accordingly. Why not have paraded them openly to the shambles? It was
      their bleating you wanted, and nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, Heffernan, how many men would have refused our offers if we
      had not made a show, at least, of respect for their scruples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, my Lord; you offered a bonus on prudery, and hence you
      met nothing but coyness. I&rsquo;d have taken another line with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what might that be?&rdquo; asked Lord Castlereagh, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compromise them,&rdquo; said Heffernan, sternly. &ldquo;I never knew the man yet, nor
      woman either, that you could n&rsquo;t place in such a position of entanglement
      that every effort to go right should seem a struggle to do wrong; and <i>vice
      versa</i>. You don&rsquo;t agree with me! Well, my Lord, I ask you if, in your
      experience of public men, you have ever met one less likely to be captured
      in this way than my friend Darcy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what I have seen and heard of the Knight of Gwynne, I acknowledge
      his character has all those elements of frankness and candor which should
      except him from such an embarrassment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he &lsquo;s in the net already,&rdquo; said Heffernan, rubbing his hands
      gleefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you told me he refused to join us, and actually saw through your
      negotiation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he did, and, in return for his keen-sightedness, I &lsquo;ve compromised him
      with his party,&mdash;you did n&rsquo;t perceive it, but the trick succeeded to
      perfection. When the Knight told me that he would not vote on the Union,
      or any measure pertaining to it, I waited for Ponsonby&rsquo;s motion, and made
      Holmes and Dawson spread the rumor at Daly&rsquo;s and through town that Darcy
      was to speak on the division, well knowing he would not rise. About eleven
      o&rsquo;clock, just as Toler sat down, Prendergast got up to reply, but there
      was a shout of &lsquo;Darcy! Darcy!&rsquo; and Prendergast resumed his seat amid great
      confusion. At that moment I left the bench beside you, and walked over to
      Darcy&rsquo;s side of the House, and whispered a few words in his ear&mdash;an
      invitation to sup, I believe it was; but while he was answering me, I
      nodded towards you, and, as I went down the steps, muttered loud enough to
      be heard, &lsquo;All right!&rsquo; Every eye was turned at once towards him, and he,
      having no intention of speaking, nor having made any preparation, felt
      both confused and amazed, and left the House about five minutes
      afterwards, while Prendergast was bungling out his tiresome reply. Before
      Darcy reached the Club House, the report was current that he was bought,
      and old Gillespie was circumstantially recounting how that his title was
      &lsquo;Lord Darcy in England,&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Baron Gwynne in that part of the United
      Kingdom called Ireland.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even success, Heffernan,&rdquo; said the Secretary, with an air of
      severity,&mdash;&ldquo;not even success will excuse a trick of this kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heffernan looked steadily towards him, as if he half doubted the sincerity
      of the speech; it seemed something above or beyond his comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lord Castlereagh, &ldquo;you heard me quite correctly. I repeat it,
      advantages obtained in this fashion are too dearly purchased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an admirable actor John Kemble is, my Lord,&rdquo; said Heffernan, with a
      quiet smile; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Castlereagh nodded his assent: the transition was too abrupt to
      please him, and he appeared to suspect that it concealed some other object
      than that of changing the topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kemble,&rdquo; continued Heffernan, while he sipped his wine carelessly,&mdash;&rdquo;
       Kemble is, I suspect strongly, the greatest actor we have ever had on the
      English stage. Have you seen him in &lsquo;Macbeth&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Several times, and always with renewed pleasure,&rdquo; said the Secretary,
      gradually recovering from his reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a force of passion he throws into the part! How terrible he makes
      the conflict between a great purpose and a weak nature! Do you remember
      his horror at the murderers who come to tell of Banquo&rsquo;s death? The sight
      of their bloody hands shocks him as though they were not the evidences of
      his own success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Castlereagh&rsquo;s calm countenance became for a second crimson, and his
      lip trembled with struggling indignation; and then, as if subduing the
      temptation of anger, he broke into a low, easy laugh, and with an
      imitation at Kemble&rsquo;s manner, called out, &ldquo;There &lsquo;s blood upon thy face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking of a bloody hand, my Lord,&rdquo; said Heffernan, at once resuming his
      former easy jocularity, &ldquo;reminds me of that Mr. Hickman, or Hickman
      O&rsquo;Reilly, as the fashion is to call him: is he to have the baronetcy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not, certainly, if we can secure him without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I think we ought. It should be quite sufficient remuneration for a
      man like him to vote with the Government; his father became a Protestant
      because it was the gentlemanly faith; and I don&rsquo;t see why the son should
      not choose his politics on the same principle. Have you ever asked him to
      dinner, my Lord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and his father, too. I have had the three generations, but I rather
      fear the party did not go off well. I had not in those days, Heffernan,
      the benefit of your admirable counsels, and picked my company unwisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great mistake with such men as these,&rdquo; said Heffernan, oracularly; &ldquo;the
      guests should have been the cream of your Lordship&rsquo;s noble acquaintance. I
      &lsquo;d have had an Earl and a Marquis at either side of each of them; I &lsquo;d
      have turned their heads with noble names, and pelted them with the Peerage
      the whole time of dinner; when he had taken wine with a chamberlain and
      some lords-in-waiting, if your Lordship would only address him, in a voice
      loud enough to be heard, as &lsquo;O&rsquo;Reilly,&rsquo; referring to him on a point of
      sporting etiquette or country gentleman&rsquo;s life, I think you might spare
      the baronetage the honor of his alliance. Do you think, on a proper
      representation, and with due securities against the repetition of the
      offence, the chancellor would let himself be called &lsquo;Clare&rsquo;? only for
      once, remember,&mdash;because I &lsquo;m satisfied, if this could be arranged,
      O&rsquo;Reilly is yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;d rather depute you to ask the question,&rdquo; said Lord Castlereagh,
      laughing; &ldquo;assuredly I &lsquo;ll not do so myself. But when do these people come
      to town?&mdash;to-morrow or next day, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Friday next they will all be here. Old Hickman comes up to receive
      something like two hundred and twenty thousand pounds,&mdash;for Darcy has
      raised the money to pay off the incumbrances,&mdash;the son is coming for
      the debate, and the grandson is to be balloted for at Daly&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made yourself master of all their arrangements, Heffernan: may I
      ask if they afford you any clew to assisting us in our object?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When can you give a dinner, my Lord?&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any day after Wednesday,&mdash;nay, Wednesday itself; I might easily get
      off Brooke&rsquo;s dinner for that day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sooner the better; time is of great consequence now. Shall we say
      Wednesday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so; now for the party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A small one: selectness is the type of cordiality. The invitation must be
      verbal, done in your own admirable way: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be late, gentlemen, for
      Beerhaven and Drogheda are to meet you, and you know they scold if the
      soup suffers,&rsquo;&mdash;something in that style. Now let us see who are our
      men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begin with Beerhaven and Drogheda, they are sure cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Massey Hamilton,&mdash;but he&rsquo;s only a commoner,&mdash;to be
      sure his uncle&rsquo;s a Duke, but, confound him, he never talks of him! I might
      draw him out about the Highlands and deer-stalking, and the Christmas
      revels at Clanchattagan; he &lsquo;s three&mdash;Kilgoff four; he &lsquo;s first-rate,
      and will discuss his noble descent till his carriage is announced.
      Loughdooner, five&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s another bore, Heffernan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he is, my Lord; but he has seven daughters, and will consequently
      make up to young Beecham, who is a great prize in the wheel matrimonial.
      We shall want a Bishop to say grace; I think Dunmore is the man: he is the
      last of your Lordship&rsquo;s making, and can&rsquo;t refuse a short invitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six, and the three Hickmans nine, and ourselves eleven; now for the
      twelfth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darcy, of course,&rdquo; said Heffernan; &ldquo;he must be asked, and, if possible,
      induced to come; Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly will be far more easily managed if we
      make him suppose that we have already secured Darcy ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll decline, Heffernan; depend upon it, he&rsquo;ll not come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think he saw through my <i>ruse</i> in the House,&mdash;not a bit of
      it; he is the least suspecting man in Ireland, and I &lsquo;ll make that very
      circumstance the reason of his coming. Hint to him that rumor says he is
      coquetting with the Government, and he &lsquo;ll go any lengths to brave public
      opinion by confronting it,&mdash;that&rsquo;s Darcy, or I &lsquo;m much mistaken in my
      man; and, to say truth, my Lord, it&rsquo;s an error I rarely fall into.&rdquo; A
      smile of self-satisfaction lit up Heffernan&rsquo;s features as he spoke; for,
      like many cunning people, his weak point was vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may call me as a witness to character whenever you please,&rdquo; said Lord
      Castlereagh, who, in indulging the self-glorification of the other, was
      now taking his own revenge; &ldquo;you certainly knew Upton better than I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depend upon it,&rdquo; said Heffernan, as he leaned back in his chair and
      delivered his words in a tone of authority,&mdash;&ldquo;depend upon it, the
      great events of life never betray the man, it is the small, every-day
      dropping occurrences both make and mar him. I made Upton my friend for
      life by missing a woodcock he aimed at; <i>he</i> brought down the bird,
      and I bagged the sportsman. Ah, my Lord, the real science of life is
      knowing how to be gracefully in the wrong; how to make those slips that
      reflect on your own prudence, by exhibiting the superior wisdom of your
      acquaintances. Of the men who compassionate your folly or deplore your
      weakness, you may borrow money, from the fellows who envy your abilities
      and extol your capacity, you &lsquo;ll never get sixpence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How came it, Heffernan, that you never took office?&rdquo; said Lord
      Castlereagh, suddenly, as if the idea forced itself abruptly upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, my Lord,&rdquo; replied Heffernan, speaking in a lower tone, and
      as if imparting a deep secret, &ldquo;they could not spare me&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
      real fact&mdash;they could not spare me. Reflect, for a moment, what kind
      of thing the Government of Ireland is; see the difficulty, nay, the
      impossibility, of any set of men arriving here fresh from England being
      able to find out their way, or make any guess at the leading characters
      about them: every retiring official likes to embarrass his successor,&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all natural and fair; then, what a mass of blunders and mistakes await the
      newly come Viceroy or Secretary! In the midst of the bleak expanse of
      pathless waste I was the sign-post. The new players, who took up the cards
      when the game was half over, could know nothing of what trumps were in, or
      what tricks were taken. I was there to tell them all; they soon saw that I
      could do this; and they also saw that I wanted nothing from any party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be confessed on every hand, Heffernan. Never was support more
      generous and independent than yours! and the subject reminds me of a
      namesake, and, as I hear, a nephew of yours, the Reverend Joshua
      Heffernan,&mdash;is not that the name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, my Lord, my nephew; but I&rsquo;m not aware of having asked anything for
      him; I never&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I did, Heffernan, and I do. He shall have the living of Drumslade; I
      spoke to the Lord-Lieutenant about it yesterday. There is a hitch
      somewhere, but we&rsquo;ll get over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What may be the obstacle you allude to?&rdquo; said Heffernan, with more
      anxiety than he wished to evince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Killgobbin says the presentation was promised to his brother, for
      his influence over Rochfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it, my Lord. It was I secured Rochfort. The case was this.
      He is separated from his wife, Lady Mary, who had a life annuity
      chargeable on Rochfort&rsquo;s pension from the Ordnance. Cook enabled me to get
      him twelve thousand pounds on the secret service list, provided he
      surrendered the pension. Rochfort was only too happy to do so, because it
      would spite his wife; and the next Gazette announced &lsquo;that the member for
      Dun raven had declared his intention of voting with the Government, but,
      to prevent even the breath of slander on his motives, had surrendered his
      retiring pension as a Store-keeper-General.&rsquo; There never was a finer theme
      for editorial panegyric, and in good sooth your Lordship&rsquo;s press made the
      most of it. What a patriot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a scoundrel!&rdquo; muttered Lord Castlereagh; and it would have puzzled a
      listener, had there been one, to say on whom the epithet was conferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for Killgobbin or his brother having influence over Rochfort, it&rsquo;s all
      absurd. Why, my Lord, it was that same brother married Rochfort to Lady
      Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is conclusive,&rdquo; said Lord Castlereagh, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, I think so,&rdquo; rejoined Heffernan; &ldquo;if you do recover after being
      hanged, I don&rsquo;t see that you want to make a friend of the fellow that
      pinioned your hands in the &lsquo;press-room.&rsquo; If there&rsquo;s no other reason
      against Jos&rsquo;s promotion than this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there were, I &lsquo;d endeavor to overcome it,&rdquo; said Lord Castlereagh.
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you take more wine? Pray let&rsquo;s have another bottle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more, my Lord; it&rsquo;s only in such safe company I ever drink so freely,&rdquo;
       said Heffernan, laughing, as he rose to say, &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;ll take measures for Wednesday, then; that is agreed upon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All settled,&rdquo; said Heffernan, as he left the room. &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a building debt on that same living of seventeen hundred pounds,&rdquo;
       said Lord Castlereagh, musing; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll easily satisfy Killgobbin that we
      mean to do better for his brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take office, indeed!&rdquo; muttered Heffernan, as he lay back in his carriage;
      &ldquo;there &lsquo;s something better than that,&mdash;governing the men that hold
      office, holding the reins, pocketing the fare, and never paying the
      breakage when the coach upsets. No, no, my Lord, you are a clever fellow
      for your years, but you must live longer before you measure Con
      Heffernan.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. THE KNIGHT&rsquo;S NOTIONS OF FINANCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Heffernan&rsquo;s calculations were all correct, and the Knight accepted Lord
      Castlereagh&rsquo;s invitation, simply because rumor attributed to him an
      alliance with the Government &ldquo;It is a pity,&rdquo; said he, laughing, &ldquo;so much
      good calumny should have so little to feed upon; so here goes to give it
      something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darcy had as little time as inclination to waste on the topic, as the
      whole interval was occupied in law business with Gleeson, who arrived each
      morning with a chariot full of parchments, and almost worried the Knight
      to death by reciting deeds and indentures, to one word of which throughout
      he could not pay the least attention. He affected to listen, however, as
      he saw how much Gleeson desired it, and he wrote his name everywhere and
      to everything he was asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; cried he, at last, &ldquo;I could have run through the whole estate
      with less fatigue of mind or body than it has cost me to keep a hold of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through all the arrangements, there was but one point on which he felt
      anxious, and the same question recurred at every moment, &ldquo;This cannot
      compromise Lionel in any way?&mdash;this will lead to no future charge
      upon the estate after my death?&rdquo; Indeed, he would not consent to any plan
      which in the slightest degree affected his son&rsquo;s interests, being
      determined that whatever his extravagances, the penalty should end with
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these matters were progressing, old Hickman studiously avoided
      meeting the Knight; a sense of his discomfiture at the abbey&mdash;a fact
      he supposed must have reached Darcy&rsquo;s ears&mdash;and the conviction that
      his long-cherished game to obtain the property was seen through, abashed
      the old man, and led him to affect illness when the Knight called.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pleasant letter which the post had brought from Lionel routed every
      other consideration from Darcy&rsquo;s mind. His son was coming over to see him,
      and bringing three or four of his brother officers to have a peep at &ldquo;the
      West,&rdquo; and a few days&rsquo; hunting with the Knight&rsquo;s pack. Every line of this
      letter glowed with buoyancy and high spirits; schemes for amusement
      alternating with the anticipated amazement of his English friends at the
      style of living they were to witness at Gwynne Abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have but eight days with you, my leave from the Prince will go
      no further,&rdquo; wrote he; &ldquo;but I know well how much may be done in that short
      space. Above all, secure Daly; I wish our fellows to see him particularly.
      I do not ask about the stable, because I know the horses are always in
      condition; but let Dan give the black horse plenty of work every day; and
      if the brown mare we got from Mulloch can be ridden by any one, she must
      have a saddle on her now. We hope to have four days&rsquo; hunting; and let the
      woodcocks take care of themselves in the intervals, for we are bent on
      massacre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The postscript was brief, but it surprised Darcy more than all the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only think of my spending four days last week down in Essex with a worthy
      kinsman of my mother&rsquo;s, Lord Netherby: a splendid place, glorious
      shooting, and the best greyhounds I ever saw run. He understands
      everything but horses; but I have taken on me to enlighten him a little,
      and have sent down four grays from Guildfords&rsquo; yesterday,&mdash;better
      than any we have in the Prince&rsquo;s stables; he is a fine fellow, though I
      did n&rsquo;t like him at first; a great courtier in his way, but <i>au fond</i>
      warm-hearted and generous. Keep my secret from my mother, but he intends
      coming over with us. Adieu! dear father. Look to Forester, don&rsquo;t let him
      run away before we arrive. Cut Dublin and its confounded politics.
      Netherby says the ministers have an immense majority,&mdash;the less
      reason for swelling or decreasing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lionel Darcy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so our trusty and well-beloved cousin of Netherby is coming to visit
      us,&rdquo; said the Knight, musing. &ldquo;Well, Lionel, I confess myself half of your
      mind. I did not like him at first: the better impression is yet to come.
      In any case, let us receive him suitably; and, fortunately, here&rsquo;s Gleeson
      to help the arrangement&mdash;Well, Gleeson, I hope matters are making
      some progress. Are we to see the last of these parchments soon? Here&rsquo;s a
      letter from my son. Read it, and you &lsquo;ll see I must get back to &lsquo;the West&rsquo;
      at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gleeson perused the letter, and when he had finished, returned it into the
      Knight&rsquo;s hand without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can we conclude this week?&rdquo; asked Darcy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are several points yet, sir, of great difficulty. Some I have
      already submitted for counsel&rsquo;s opinion; one in particular, as regards the
      serving the notice of repayment: there would appear to be a doubt on this
      head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be none in reality,&rdquo; said Darcy, hastily. &ldquo;I have Hickman&rsquo;s
      letter, in his own handwriting, averring his readiness to release the
      mortgage at any day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the document witnessed, and on a stamp?&rdquo; asked Gleeson, cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is not. Those are scarcely the forms of a note between two
      private gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be of use in equity, no doubt,&rdquo; muttered Gleeson, &ldquo;or before a
      jury; but we have no time for these considerations now. The
      Attorney-General thinks&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the Attorney-General. Have we the money to repay? Well, does
      Hickman refuse to accept it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not been asked as yet, sir,&rdquo; said Gleeson, whose business notions
      were not a little ruffled by this abrupt mode of procedure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, Gleeson! why pester yourself and me with
      overcoming obstacles that may never arise? Wait on Hickman at once,&mdash;to-day.
      Tell him we are prepared, and desirous of paying off these incumbrances.
      If he objects, hear his objection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will refer me to his solicitor, sir,&mdash;Mr. Kennedy, of Hume
      Street,&mdash;a very respectable man, no higher in the profession, but I
      may remark, in confidence, one who has no objection to a suit in equity or
      a trial at bar. It is not money Hickman wants, sir. He is perfectly
      satisfied with his security.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil is it, then? He&rsquo;s not Shylock, is he?&rdquo; said Darcy,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very unlike, perhaps, sir; but in the present instance, it is your
      influence with the Government he desires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have none, Gleeson,&mdash;actually none. No man knows that better
      than you do. I could not make a gauger or a tide-waiter to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you might, sir,&mdash;you might make a peer of the realm if you
      wished it. Hickman knows this; and whatever scruples <i>you</i> might have
      in adopting the necessary steps, <i>his</i> conscience could never
      recognize them as worthy a moment&rsquo;s consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a topic I &lsquo;ll scarcely discuss with him,&rdquo; said the Knight,
      proudly. &ldquo;I never, so far as I know, promised to pay a percentage in my
      principles as well as in my gold. Mr. Hickman has a fair claim on the one;
      on the other, neither he nor any other man shall make an unjust demand. I
      am not of Christie Ford&rsquo;s mind,&rdquo; added he, laughingly. &ldquo;He says, Gleeson,
      that if the English are bent on taking away <i>our</i> Parliament, the
      only revenge we have left is to spoil <i>their</i> peerage. This is but a
      sorry theme to joke upon, after all; and, to come back, what say you to
      trying my plan? I am to meet the old fellow at dinner, on Wednesday next,
      at Lord Castlereagh&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, sir!&rdquo; said Gleeson, with a mixture of surprise and agitation
      greatly disproportioned to the intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Why does that astonish you? The Secretary is too shrewd to neglect
      such men as these; they are the rising influences of Ireland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gleeson muttered a half assent; but evidently too much occupied with his
      own reflections to pay due attention to the Knight&rsquo;s remark, continued to
      himself, &ldquo;on Wednesday!&rdquo; then added aloud, &ldquo;On Monday he is to be in
      Kildare. He told me he would remain there to receive his rents, and on
      Wednesday return to town. I believe, sir, there may be good counsel in
      your words. I &lsquo;ll try on Monday. I &lsquo;ll follow him down to Kildare, and as
      the papers relative to the abbey property are all in readiness, I&rsquo;ll
      endeavor to conclude that at once. So you are to meet at dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That same dinner-party seems to puzzle you,&rdquo; said the Knight, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not at all, sir,&rdquo; replied Gleeson, hurriedly. &ldquo;You were desirous of
      getting home next week to meet Mr. Lionel&mdash;Captain Darcy I must call
      him; if this arrangement can be made, there will be no difficulty in your
      return. But of course you will not leave town before it is completed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Knight pledged himself to be guided by his man of business in all
      respects; but when they parted, he could not conceal from himself that
      Gleeson&rsquo;s agitated and troubled manner, so very unlike his usual calm
      deportment, boded difficulties and embarrassments which to his own eyes
      were invisible.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. A HURRIED VISIT
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was on a severe night, with frequent gusts of stormy wind shaking the
      doors and window-frames, or carrying along the drifted flakes of snow with
      which the air was charged, that Lady Eleanor, her daughter, and Forester,
      were seated round the fire. All the appliances of indoor comfort by which
      they were surrounded seemed insufficient to dispel a sense of sadness that
      pervaded the little party. Conversation flowed not as it was wont, in its
      pleasant current, diverging here and there as fancy or caprice suggested;
      the sentences were few and brief, the pauses between them long and
      frequent; a feeling of awkwardness, too, mingled with the gloom, for, at
      intervals, each would make an endeavor to relieve the weariness of time,
      and in the effort show a consciousness of constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Eleanor lay back in her deep chair, and, with half-closed lids,
      seemed lost in thought. Helen was working at her embroidery, and,
      apparently, diligently too, although a shrewd observer might have remarked
      on the slow progress the work was making, and how inevitably her balls of
      colored worsted seemed bent on entanglement; while Forester sat silently
      gazing on the wood fire, and watching the bright sparks as they flitted
      and danced above the red flame; his brow was clouded, and his look
      sorrowful; not without reason, perhaps: it was to be his last evening at
      the abbey; the last of those hours of happiness which seemed all the
      fairer when about to part with them forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Eleanor seemed grieved at his approaching departure. From the habit
      of his mind, and the nature of his education, he was more companionable to
      her than Lionel.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw in him many qualities of high and sterling value, and even in his
      prejudices she could trace back several of those traits which marked her
      own youth, when, in the pride of her English breeding, she would tolerate
      no deviation from the habits of her own country. It was true, many of
      these notions had given way since his residence at the abbey; many of his
      opinions had undergone modification or change, but still he was
      distinctively English.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen, who possessed no standard by which to measure such prejudices, was
      far less indulgent towards them; her joyous, happy nature&mdash;the
      heirloom of her father&rsquo;s house&mdash;led her rather to jest than argue on
      these topics, and she contrasted the less apt and ready apprehension of
      Forester with the native quickness of her brother Lionel, disadvantageous
      to the former. She was sorry, too, that he was going; more so, because his
      society was so pleasing to her mother, and that before him, Lady Eleanor
      exerted herself in a way which eventually reacted favorably on her own
      health and spirits. Further than this, her interest in him was weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so Forester: he was hopelessly, inextricably, in love, not the less so
      that he would not acknowledge it to himself; far more so because he had
      made no impression on the object of his passion. There is a period in
      every story of affection when the flame grows the brighter because
      unreflected, and seems the more concentrated because unreturned. Forester
      was in this precise stage of the malady; he was as much piqued by the
      indifference as fascinated by the charms of Helen Darcy. The very
      exertions he made for victory stimulated his own passion; while, in her
      efforts to interest or amuse him, he could not help feeling the evidence
      of her indifference to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have said that the conversation was broken and interrupted; at length
      it almost ceased altogether, a stray remark of Lady Eleanor&rsquo;s, followed by
      a short reply from Forester, alone breaking the silence. Nor were these
      always very pertinent, inasmuch as the young aide-de-camp occasionally
      answered his own reflections, and not the queries of his hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An interesting time in Dublin, no doubt,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, half talking
      to herself; &ldquo;for though the forces are unequal, and victory and defeat
      predestined, there will be a struggle still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam, a brief one,&rdquo; answered Forester, dreamily, comprehending only
      a part of her remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A brief and a vain one,&rdquo; echoed Lady Eleanor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, rather, a glorious one,&rdquo; interposed Helen; &ldquo;the last cheer of a
      sinking crew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forester looked up, startled into attention by the energy of these few
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say so too, Helen,&rdquo; remarked her mother, &ldquo;if they were not
      accessory to their own misfortunes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, Mamma, you must not remember their failings in their hour of
      distress; there is a noble-hearted minority untainted yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be a majority of eighteen,&rdquo; said Forester, whose thoughts were
      wandering away, while he endeavored to address himself to what he believed
      they were saying; nor was he aware of his error till aroused by the
      laughter of Lady Eleanor and her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighteen!&rdquo; reiterated he, solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How few!&rdquo; remarked Lady Eleanor, almost scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should say, how costly, Mamma!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen. &ldquo;These gentlemen are
      as precious from their price as their rarity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is scarcely fair, Miss Darcy,&rdquo; said Forester, at once recalled to
      himself by the tone of mockery she spoke in; &ldquo;many adopted the views of
      Government, after duly weighing every consideration of the measure: some,
      to my own knowledge, resisted offers of great personal advantage, and Lord
      Castlereagh was not aware of their adhesion&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till he had them <i>en poche</i>, I suppose,&rdquo; said Helen, sarcastically;
      &ldquo;just as you have been pleased to do with my ball of yellow worsted, and
      for which I shall be thankful if you will restore it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forester blushed deeply, as he drew from his coat-pocket the worsted,
      which in a moment of abstraction he had lifted from the ground, and thrust
      into his pocket, without knowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had any moderately shrewd observer witnessed his confusion, and her
      enjoyment of it, he would easily have understood the precise relation of
      the two parties to each other. Forester&rsquo;s absence of mind betrayed his
      engaged affection as palpably as Helen&rsquo;s laughter did her own
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Eleanor did not remark either; her thoughts still rested on the topic
      of which they had spoken, for it was a subject of no inconsiderable
      difficulty to her. Whatever her sense of indignant contempt for the bribed
      adherents of the Ministry, her convictions always inclined to these
      measures, whose origin was from her native country; her predilections were
      strongly English; not only her happiest days had been passed there, but
      she was constantly contrasting the position they would have occupied and
      sustained in that favored land, against the wasteful and purposeless
      extravagance of their life in Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it too late to amend? was the question ever rising to her mind, now if
      even yet the Knight should be induced to adopt the more ambitious course?
      Every accidental circumstance seemed favorable to the notion: the
      Government craving his support; her own relatives, influential as they
      were from rank and station, soliciting it; the Prince himself according
      favors which could no more be rejected than acknowledged ungraciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a career for Lionel! What a future for Helen!&rdquo; such were reflections
      that would press themselves upon her, but to whose disentanglement her
      mind suggested no remedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis Mr. Daly, my Lady,&rdquo; said Tate, for something like the fourth time,
      without being attended to. &ldquo;&lsquo;T is Mr. Daly wants leave to visit you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bagenal Daly, Mamma, wishes to know if you&rsquo;ll receive him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Daly is exactly the kind of person to suggest this impracticable line
      of policy,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, with half-closed eyes; for the name alone
      had struck her, and she had not heard what was said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mamma,&rdquo; said Helen, rising, and leaning over her chair, &ldquo;it is a
      visit he proposes; nothing so very impracticable in that, I hope!&rdquo; and
      then, at a gesture from her mother, continued to Tate, &ldquo;Lady Eleanor will
      be very happy to see Mr. Daly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Eleanor had scarcely aroused herself from her revery when Bagenal
      Daly entered. His manner was stately, perhaps somewhat colder than usual,
      and he took his seat with an air of formal politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come, my Lady,&rdquo; said he, slowly, &ldquo;to learn if I can be of any
      service in the capital; unexpected news has just reached me, requiring my
      immediate departure for Dublin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-night, sir, I hope; it is very severe, and likely, I fear, to
      continue so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night, madam, within an hour, I expect to be on the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you defer a little longer, and we may be fellow-travellers,&rdquo; said
      Forester; &ldquo;I was to start to-morrow morning, but my packing can soon be
      made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, smiling, &ldquo;that you will not leave us
      unprotected, gentlemen, and that one, at least, will remain here.&rdquo; This
      speech, apparently addressed to both, was specially intended for Forester,
      whose cheek tingled with a flush of pleasure as he heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt, madam, that Captain Forester, whose age and profession
      are more in accordance with gallantry, will respond to your desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could really fancy that I was not yielding to my own wishes only,&rdquo;
       stammered out Forester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I make it a request.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, sir, how happy to be entreated to what one&rsquo;s wishes incline them,&rdquo;
       added Daly; &ldquo;you may go through a deal of life without being twice so
      fortunate. I should apologize for so brief a notice of my departure, Lady
      Eleanor, but the intelligence I have received is pressing.&rdquo; Here he
      dropped his voice to a whisper. &ldquo;The Ministers have hurried forward their
      bill, and I shall scarcely be in time for the second reading.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All accounts agree in saying that the Government majority is certain,&rdquo;
       observed Lady Eleanor, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to be feared, madam, that such rumors are well founded, but the
      party who form the forlorn hope have their devoirs also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a very indifferent politician, Mr. Daly, but it strikes me that a
      body so manifestly corrupt, give the strongest possible reasons for their
      own destruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were they all so, madam, I should join in the sentiment as freely as you
      utter it,&rdquo; replied Daly, proudly; &ldquo;but it is a heavy sentence that would
      condemn the whole crew because there was a mutiny in the steerage;
      besides, these rights and privileges are held only in trust; no man can in
      honor or justice vote away that of which he is only the temporary
      occupant; forgive me, I beg, for daring to discuss the topic, but I
      thought the Knight had made you a convert to his own opinions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have never spoken on the subject, Mr. Daly,&rdquo; replied Lady Eleanor,
      coldly; &ldquo;the Knight dislikes the intrusion of a political matter within
      the circle of his family, and for that reason, perhaps,&rdquo; added she, with a
      smile, &ldquo;my daughter and myself feel for it all the temptation of a
      forbidden pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen, who heard the last few words of her mother&rsquo;s
      speech, &ldquo;I am as violent a partisan as Mr. Daly could ask for; indeed, I
      am not certain if all my doctrines are not of his own teaching; I fear the
      Premier, distrust the Cabinet, and put no faith in the Secretary for
      Ireland; is not that the first article of our creed?&mdash;nay, nay, fear
      was no part of your instruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet I have fears, my dear Helen, and very great fears just now,&rdquo; said
      Daly in a low whisper, only audible by herself, and she turned her full
      and beaming eyes upon him for an explanation. As if anxious to escape the
      interrogatory, Daly arose hastily. &ldquo;I must crave your indulgence for an
      abrupt leave-taking, Lady Eleanor,&rdquo; said he, approaching, as he kissed the
      hand held out to him; &ldquo;I shall be able to tell the Knight that I left you
      both well, and under safe protection. Captain Forester, adieu; you need no
      admonition of mine respecting your charge;&rdquo; and, with a low and courtly
      salute, he departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rely upon it, Captain Forester, he&rsquo;s bent on mischief now. I never saw
      him particularly mild and quiet in his manner that it was not the prelude
      to some desperate ebullition,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the very strangest of all mortals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, the most single-minded and straightforward,&rdquo; interposed Helen, &ldquo;and
      I &lsquo;ll agree with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When men of strong minds and ambitious views are curbed and held in
      within the petty sphere of a small social circle, they are, to my
      thinking, intolerable. It is making a drawing-room pet of a tiger; every
      step he takes upsets a vase or smashes a jar. You smile at my simile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a most happy one,&rdquo; said Forester, continuing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I enter a dissent,&rdquo; cried Helen, playfully. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a tiger, if you will,
      with his foes, but in all the relations of private life, gentleness
      itself; for my part, I can imagine no more pleasing contrast to the modern
      code of manners than Mr. Bagenal Daly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Captain Forester, if you would win Miss Darcy&rsquo;s favor, you have
      now the model for your imitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forester&rsquo;s face flushed, and he appeared overwhelmed with confusion, while
      Helen went on with her embroidery, tranquil as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; resumed Lady Eleanor,&mdash;&ldquo;I believe, after all, I am
      unjust to him; but much may be forgiven me for being so; he has made my
      son a wild, thoughtless boy, and my daughter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No indiscretions, Mamma,&rdquo; cried Helen, holding up her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he has made my daughter <i>telle que vous la voyez</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forester was too well bred to venture on a word of flattery or compliment,
      but his glowing color and sparkling eyes spoke his admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Eleanor&rsquo;s quick glance remarked this; and, as if the thought had
      never occurred before, she seemed amazed, either at the fact or at her own
      previous inattention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us finish that second volume you were reading, Captain Forester,&rdquo;
       said she, glad to cut short the discussion. And, without a word, he took
      the book and began to read.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. BAGENAL DALY&rsquo;S JOURNEY TO DUBLIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is not our desire to practise any mystery with our reader, nor would
      the present occasion warrant such. Mr. Daly&rsquo;s hurried departure for Dublin
      was caused by the receipt of tidings which had that morning reached him,
      conveying the startling intelligence that his friend the Knight had
      accepted terms from the Government, and pledged himself to support their
      favored measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a time when men were accustomed to witness the most flagrant
      breaches of honor and good faith. No station was too high to be above the
      reach of this reproach, no position too humble not to make its possessor a
      mark for corruption. It was an epidemic of dishonesty, and people ceased
      to wonder as they heard of each new victim to the malady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bagenal Daly well knew that no man could be more exempt from an imputation
      of this nature than the Knight of Gwynne: every act of his life, every
      sentiment he professed, every trait of his character, flatly contradicted
      the supposition. But he also knew that though Darcy was unassailable by
      all the temptations of bribery, come in what shape they might, that his
      frank and generous spirit would expose him to the stratagems and devices
      of a wily and insidious party, and that if, by any accident, an expression
      should fall from him in all the freedom of convivial enjoyment that could
      be tortured into even the resemblance of a pledge, he well knew that his
      friend would deem any sacrifice of personal feeling light in the balance,
      rather than not adhere to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resolved not to lose a moment, he despatched Sandy to order horses along
      the line, and having passed the remainder of the day in the preparations
      for his departure, he left the abbey before midnight. A less determined
      traveller might have hesitated on setting out on such a night: the long
      menacing storm had at length burst forth, and the air resounded with a
      chaos of noise, amid which the roaring breakers and the crash of falling
      trees were uppermost; with difficulty the horses were enabled to keep
      their feet, as the sea washed heavily over the wall and deluged the road,
      while at intervals the fallen timber obstructed the way and delayed his
      progress. Difficulty was, however, the most enjoyable stimulant to Daly&rsquo;s
      nature; he loved an obstacle as other men enjoy a pleasure, and, as he
      grew older, so far from yielding to the indolence of years, his hardy
      spirit seemed to revel in the thought that amid dangers and perils his
      whole life had been passed, yet never had he suffered himself to be a
      beaten enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of that night, and all the following day, the violence of the
      storm was unabated; uprooted trees and wrecked villages met his eye as he
      passed, while, in the larger towns, the houses were strongly barred and
      shuttered, and scarcely one living thing to be seen through the streets.
      Nothing short of the united influence of bribery and intimidation could
      procure horses in such a season, and had any messenger of less sturdy
      pretensions than honest Sandy been despatched to order them, they would
      have been flatly refused. Bagenal Daly and his man were, however, too well
      known in that part of Ireland to make such a course advisable, and though
      postboys and ostlers condoled together, the signal of Daly&rsquo;s appearance
      silenced every thought of opposition, and the words, &ldquo;I &lsquo;m ready!&rdquo; were an
      order to dash forward none dared to disobey.
    </p>
    <p>
      So had it continued until he reached Moate, where he found a message from
      Sandy, informing him that no horses could be procured, and that he must
      bring on those from Athlone the entire way to Kilbeggan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear me,&rdquo; cried Daly to the astonished postboy, who for the last two
      miles had spared neither whip nor spur, in the glad anticipation of a
      speedy shelter,&mdash;&ldquo;you hear me. To Kilbeggan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, begorra! that&rsquo;s impossible, yer honor. If it was the month of May,
      and the road was a bowling-green, the bastes couldn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; cried Daly, shutting up the glass, and throwing himself back in
      the chaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0006" id="linkimage-0006">
      <!-- IMG --></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/185.jpg" width="100%" alt="185 " />
    </div>
    <p>
      But the postboy only buttoned up the collar of his coat around his face,
      thrust his whip into his boot, and, drawing his sleeves over his hands,
      sat a perfect picture of fatalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, go on!&rdquo; shouted Daly, as he lowered the front window of the
      chaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      A low muttering from the driver, still impassive as before, was all the
      reply, and at the same instant a sharp report was heard, and a pistol
      bullet whizzed beside his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go <i>now?</i>&rdquo; cried Bagenal Daly, as he levelled another
      weapon on the window; but no second entreaty was necessary, and, with his
      bead bent down almost to the mane, and with a mingled cry for mercy and
      imprecation together, he drove the spurs into his jaded beast, and whipped
      with all his might through the almost deserted town. With the despairing
      energy of one who felt his life was in peril, the wretched postboy hurried
      madly forward, urging the tired animals up the hills, and caring neither
      for rut nor hollow on his onward course, till at length, blown and
      exhausted, the animals came to a dead stand, and, with heaving flanks and
      outstretched forelegs, refused to budge a step farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried the postboy, as, dropping from the saddle, he fell on his
      knees upon the road, &ldquo;shoot, and be d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d to you; I can
      do no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The terrified expression of the fellow&rsquo;s face as the lamp of the chaise
      threw its light upon him, seemed to change the current of Daly&rsquo;s thoughts,
      for he laughed loud and heartily as he looked upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said he, good-humoredly, &ldquo;is not that Kilbeggan where I see
      the lights yonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorra bit of it,&rdquo; sighed the other, &ldquo;it is only Horseleap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, push on to Horseleap; perhaps they &lsquo;ve horses there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begorra! you might as well look for black tay in a bog-hole; &lsquo;t is a poor
      &lsquo;shebeen&rsquo; is the only thing in the village;&rdquo; and, so saying, he took the
      bridle on his arm, and walked along before the horses, who, with drooping
      heads, tottered after at a foot pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half an hour of such travelling brought Daly in front of a miserable
      cabin, over the door of which a creaking sign proclaimed accommodation for
      man and beast. To the partial truth of this statement the bright glare of
      a fire that shone between the chinks of the shutters bore witness, and,
      disengaging himself from the chaise, Daly knocked loudly for admission.
      There are few less conciliating sounds to the ears of a hot-tempered man
      than those hesitating whispers which, while exposed to a storm himself, he
      hears deliberating on the question of his admission. Such were the
      mutterings Daly now listened to, and to which he was about to reply by
      forcing his entrance, when the door was opened by a man in the dress of a
      peasant, who somewhat sulkily demanded what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horses, if you have them, to reach Kilbeggan,&rdquo; said Daly, &ldquo;and if you
      have not, a good fire and shelter until they can be procured;&rdquo; and as he
      spoke, he pushed past the man, and entered the room from which the blazing
      light proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his back to the fire, and hands thrust carelessly into the pockets of
      his coat, stood a man of eight-and-thirty or forty years of age; in dress,
      air, and appearance he might have been taken for a country horse-dealer;
      and so, indeed, his well-worn top-boots and green coat, cut in jockey
      fashion, seemed to bespeak him. He was rather under the middle size, but
      powerfully built, his wide chest, long arms, and bowed legs all indicating
      the possession of that strength which is never the accompaniment of more
      perfect symmetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Daly&rsquo;s appearance unquestionably proclaimed his class in life,
      the other exhibited no mark of deference or respect to him as he entered,
      but maintained his position with the same easy indifference as at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make yourself at home here, good friend, if one might judge from the
      way you knocked at the door,&rdquo; said he, addressing Daly with a look whose
      easy familiarity was itself an impertinence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have yet to learn,&rdquo; said Daly, sternly, &ldquo;that a gentleman must practise
      any peculiar ceremony when seeking the shelter of a &lsquo;shebeen,&rsquo; not to
      speak of the right by which such as you address me as your good friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An insolent laugh, that Daly fancied was re-echoed by some one without,
      was the first reply to this speech; when, after a few minutes, the man
      added, &ldquo;I see you &lsquo;re a stranger in these parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had not been so, the chance is I should have taught you somewhat
      better manners before this time. Move aside, sir, and let me see the
      fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the other never budged in the slightest, standing in the same easy
      posture as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daly&rsquo;s dark face grew darker, and his heavy brows met in a deep frown,
      while, with a spring that showed no touch of time in his strong frame, he
      bounded forward and seized the man by the collar. Few men were Daly&rsquo;s
      equals in point of strength; but although he with whom he now grappled
      made no resistance whatever, Daly never stirred him from the spot, to
      which he seemed fast and firmly rooted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s enough of it!&rdquo; said the fellow, as with a rough jerk he
      freed himself from the grasp, and sent Daly several paces back into the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so!&rdquo; cried Daly, whose passion now boiled over, and, drawing a pistol
      from his bosom, he levelled it at him. Quick as the motion was, the other
      was equally ready, for his hand now presented a similar weapon at Daly&rsquo;s
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Move aside, or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A coarse, insulting laugh drowned Daly&rsquo;s words, and he pulled the trigger;
      but the pistol snapped without exploding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is, now,&rdquo; cried the fellow, rudely; &ldquo;luck&rsquo;s against you, old
      boy, so you &lsquo;d better keep yourself cool and easy;&rdquo; and with these words
      he uncocked the weapon and replaced it in his bosom. Daly watched the
      moment, and with a bound placed himself beside him, when, bringing his leg
      in front, he caught the man round the middle, and hurled him headlong on
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell as if he had been shot; but, rolling over, he leaned upon his
      elbow and looked up, without the slightest sign of passion or even
      excitement on his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;d know that trip in a thousand; begad, you &lsquo;re Bagenal Daly, and
      nobody else!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although not a little surprised at the recognition, Daly suffered no sign
      of astonishment to escape him, but drew his chair to the fire, and
      stretched out his legs before the blaze. Meanwhile, the other, having
      arisen, leaned over the back of a chair, and stared at him steadfastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am as glad as a hundred-pound note, now, you did n&rsquo;t provoke me to lay
      a hand on you, Mr. Daly,&rdquo; said he, slowly, and in a voice not devoid of a
      touch of feeling; &ldquo;&lsquo;t is n&rsquo;t often I bear malice, but I &lsquo;d never forgive
      myself the longest day I &lsquo;d live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daly turned his eyes towards him, and, for some minutes, they continued to
      look at each other without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you don&rsquo;t remember me, sir,&rdquo; said the stranger, at length; &ldquo;but I
      &lsquo;ve a better memory, and a better reason to have it besides: you saved my
      life once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saved your life!&rdquo; repeated Daly, thoughtfully; &ldquo;I &lsquo;ve not the slightest
      recollection of ever having seen you before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all true I &lsquo;m telling, for all that,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;and
      although it happened above five-and-twenty years since, I&rsquo;m not much
      changed, they tell me, in look or appearance.&rdquo; He paused at these words,
      as if to give Daly time to recognize him; but the effort seemed in vain,
      as, after along and patient scrutiny, Daly said, &ldquo;No, I cannot remember
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see, then,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;if I can&rsquo;t refresh your memory. Were
      you in Dublin in the winter of &lsquo;75?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I had a house in Stephen&rsquo;s Green&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And used to drive four black thoroughbreds without winkers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear that <i>you</i> know me, at least,&rdquo; said Daly; &ldquo;go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, do you remember, it was about a week before Christmas, that
      Captain Burke Fitzsimon was robbed of a pair of pistols in the guard-room
      of the Upper Castle Yard, in noonday, ay, and tied with his own sash to
      the guard-bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! I do. He was regularly laughed out of the regiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, and many that laughed at him mightn&rsquo;t have behaved a deal better
      than he did,&rdquo; replied the other, with a dogged sternness in his manner. He
      became silent after these words, and appeared deeply sunk in meditation,
      when suddenly he drew two splendidly chased pistols from his bosom, and
      held them out to Daly as he said, &ldquo;There they are, and as good as they are
      handsome, true at thirty paces, and never fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daly gazed alternately from the pistols to their owner, but never uttered
      a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That same day,&rdquo; resumed the man, &ldquo;you were walking down the quay near the
      end of Watling Street, when there was a cry of &lsquo;Stop thief!&mdash;stop
      him!&mdash;a hundred guineas to the man that takes him!&rsquo; and shortly after
      a man crossed the quay, pursued closely by several people, one of them,
      and the foremost, being Tom Lambert, the constable, the strongest man,
      they said, of his day, in Ireland. The fellow that ran could beat them
      all, and was doing it too, when, just as he had gained Bloody Bridge, he
      saw a child on the pathway all covered with blood, and a bulldog standing
      over him, worrying him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it all,&rdquo; said Daly, interrupting him; &ldquo;&lsquo;tis as fresh before me as
      if it happened yesterday. The robber stopped to save the child, and,
      seizing the bulldog by the throat, hurled him over the wall into the
      Liffey. Lambert, as you call him, had by this time come close up, and was
      within two yards of the man, when I, feeling compassion for a fellow that
      could be generous at such a moment, laid my hand on the constable&rsquo;s arm to
      stop him; he struck me; but if he did, he had his reward, for I threw him
      over the hip on the crown of his head, and he had a brain fever after it
      that almost brought him to death&rsquo;s door. And where were you all this time,
      and what were you doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was down Barrack Street, across the park, and near Knockmaroon Gate,
      before they could find a door to stretch Tom Lambert on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; said Daly, staring at him; &ldquo;why, it was Freney, they told me,
      performed that exploit for a wager.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it was, sir,&rdquo; said the man, standing up and crossing his arms, not
      without something of pride in his look,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Freney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daly arose and gazed at the man with all that curious scrutiny one bestows
      upon some remarkable object, measuring his strong, athletic frame with the
      eye of a connoisseur, and, as it were, calculating the physical resources
      of so powerful a figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, sir,&rdquo; said the robber, at last, &ldquo;I was right when I told you
      that you saved my life: there were thirteen indictments hanging over my
      head that day, and if I &lsquo;d been taken they &lsquo;d have hanged me as round as a
      turnip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You owe it to yourself,&rdquo; said Daly; &ldquo;had you not stopped for the child,
      it was just as likely that I &lsquo;d have tripped you up myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a feeling I never could get over,&rdquo; said the robber; &ldquo;&lsquo;twas a little
      boy, about the same age as that, that saved the Kells coach the night I
      stopped it near Dangan. And now, sir, let me ask you what in the world
      brought you into the village of Horseleap? For I am sure,&rdquo; added he with a
      laugh, &ldquo;it was never to look after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right there, friend; I&rsquo;m on my way up to town to be present at
      the debate in Parliament on the Union,&mdash;a question that has its
      interest for yourself too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so, sir?&rdquo; said the other, curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plainly enough, man; if they carry the Union, they&rsquo;ll not leave a man
      worth robbing in the island. You &lsquo;ll have to take to an honest calling,
      Freney,&mdash;turn cattle-drover. By the way, they tell me you &lsquo;re a good
      judge of a horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except yourself, there&rsquo;s not a better in the island; and if you &lsquo;ve no
      objection, I &lsquo;ll mount and keep you company as far as Maynooth, where you
      &lsquo;ll easily get horses&mdash;and it will be broad daylight by that time&mdash;to
      bring you into Dublin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept the offer willingly. I&rsquo;ll venture to say we shall not be robbed
      on the journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, the horses won&rsquo;t be here for an hour yet, and if you &lsquo;ll join
      me in a bit of supper I was going to have when you came in, it will help
      to pass the time till we are ready to start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daly assented, not the less readily that he had not eaten anything since
      morning, and Freney left the room to hasten the preparations for the meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Freney,&rdquo; said Daly, as the other entered the room a few moments
      after, &ldquo;was it the strength of conscious rectitude that made you stand my
      fire as you did a while ago, or did you think me so bad a marksman at four
      paces?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither, sir,&rdquo; replied the robber, laughing; &ldquo;I saw the pan of the lock
      half open as you drew it from your pocket, and I knew the priming must
      have fallen out; but for that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had probably fired, yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; rejoined he, with a short nod. &ldquo;I could have shot you before
      you levelled at me. Now, sir, here&rsquo;s something far better than burning
      powder. I am sure you are too old a traveller not to be able to eat a
      rasher of bacon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this I take to be as free of any allegiance to the king as yourself,&rdquo;
       said Daly, as he poured out a wineglass-ful of &ldquo;poteen&rdquo; from a short black
      bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;re right, sir,&rdquo; said Freney, with a laugh. &ldquo;We &lsquo;re both duty free.
      Let me help you to an egg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never ate better bacon in my life,&rdquo; said Daly, who seemed to relish his
      supper with considerable gusto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you like it, sir. It is a notion of mine that Costy Moore of
      Kilcock cures a pig better than any man in this part of Ireland; and
      though his shop is next the police-barracks, I went in there myself to buy
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daly stared, with something of admiration in his look, at the man whose
      epicurism was indulged at the hazard of his neck; and he pledged the
      robber with a motion of the head that betokened a high sense of his
      daring. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard you have had some close escapes, Freney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was never taken but once, sir. A woman hid my shoes when I was asleep.
      I was at the foot of the Galtee mountains: the ground is hard and full of
      sharp shingle, and I could n&rsquo;t run. They brought me into Clonmel, and I
      was in the heaviest irons in the jail before two hours were over. That&rsquo;s
      the strong jail, Mr. Daly; they &lsquo;ve the best walls and the thickest doors
      there I have ever seen in any jail in Ireland. For,&rdquo; added he, with a sly
      laugh, &ldquo;I went over them all, in a friendly sort of a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A kind of professional tour, Freney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so, sir; taking a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the country from the drop,
      because, maybe, I would n&rsquo;t have time for it at another opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;re a hardened villain!&rdquo; said Daly, looking at him with an expression
      the robber felt to be a finished compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no lie, Mr. Daly; and if I wasn&rsquo;t, could I go on for twenty years,
      hunted down like a wild beast, with fellows tracking me all day, and lying
      in watch for me all night? Where we are sitting now is the only spot in
      the whole island where I can say I &lsquo;m safe. This is my brother&rsquo;s cabin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother is the same man that opened the door for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Freney nodded, and went on: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a poor laboring man, with four acres of
      wet bog for a farm, and a young woman, in the ague, for a wife, and if it
      was n&rsquo;t for myself he &lsquo;d be starving; and would you believe it, now, he &lsquo;d
      not take to the road for one night&mdash;just one single night&mdash;to be
      as rich as the Duke of Leinster; and here am I&rdquo;&mdash;and, as he spoke,
      his chest expanded, and his dark eyes flashed wildly&mdash;&ldquo;here am I,
      that would rather be on my black mare&rsquo;s back, with my holsters at the
      saddle, watching the sounds of wheels on a lonely road, than I &lsquo;d be any
      gentleman in the land, barring your own self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why me?&rdquo; said Daly, in a voice whose melancholy cadence made it
      solemn as a death-bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just because you &lsquo;re the only man I ever heard tell of that was fond of
      danger for the fun of it. Did n&rsquo;t I see the leap you took at the Black
      Lough, just to show the English Lord-Lieutenant how an Irish gentleman
      rides, with the rein in your mouth, and your hands behind your back? Isn&rsquo;t
      that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daly nodded, and muttered, &ldquo;I have the old horse still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the good day! I &lsquo;d spend a week in Newgate to see you on his back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Freney,&rdquo; said Daly, who seemed not disposed to encourage a
      conversation so personal in its allusions, &ldquo;where have you been lately?&mdash;in
      the South?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I spent the last fortnight watching an old fox that doubled on
      me at last,&mdash;old Hickman, of Loughrea, that used to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Hickman!&mdash;what of him?&rdquo; cried Daly, whose interest became at
      once excited by the mention of the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found out, sir, that he was to be down here at Kildare to receive his
      rents,&mdash;for he owns a fine estate here,&mdash;and that, besides, Tom
      Gleeson, the great agent from Dublin, was to meet him, as some said, to
      pay him a large sum of money for the Knight of Gwynne,&mdash;some heavy
      debt, I believe, owing for many a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, go on. What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well. I knew the reason Hickman wanted the money here: Lord Tyrawley was
      going to sell him a part of Gore&rsquo;s Wood, for hard cash&mdash;d &lsquo;ye mind,
      sir, hard cash&mdash;down on the nail, for my Lord likes high play at
      Daly&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash;n Lord Tyrawley!&rdquo; said Daly, impatiently. &ldquo;What of
      Hickman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, d&mdash;&mdash;n him too! He&rsquo;s a shabby negur. I stopped &lsquo;him at
      Ball&rsquo;s Bridge once, and got but three guineas and some shillings for my
      pains. But to come back to old Hickman: I found he had arrived at the
      &lsquo;Black Dog,&rsquo; and that Gleeson had come the same evening, and so I
      disguised myself like an old farmer the next morning, and pretended I
      wanted his advice about an asthma that I had, just to see the lie of the
      old premises, and whether he was alone, or had the two bailiffs with him,
      as usual. There they were, sir, sure enough, and well armed too, and fresh
      hasps on the door, to lock it inside, all secure as a bank. I saw these
      things while the old doctor was writing the prescription, for he tore a
      leaf out of his pocket-book to order me some stuff for the cough,&mdash;faith,
      &lsquo;t is pills of another kind they &lsquo;d have given me if they found me out.
      That was all I got for my guinea in goold, not to speak of the danger;&rdquo;
       and, so saying, he pulled a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket, and
      held it out towards Daly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it, sir; &lsquo;t is the other side the
      writing is on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Daly&rsquo;s eyes were fixed upon the paper, which he held firmly between
      both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I see what you are looking at,&rdquo; said Freney; &ldquo;that was a kind of
      memorandum the old fellow made of the money Gleeson paid him the day
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daly paid no attention to the remark, but muttered half aloud the contents
      of the document before him: &ldquo;Check on Ball for eighteen thousand, payable
      at sight,&mdash;thirty-six thousand eight hundred and ten pounds in notes
      of the Bank of England,&mdash;gold, seventeen hundred guineas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a lob,&rdquo; cried Freney, as he rubbed his hands together. &ldquo;I was
      set up for life if I got half of it! And now, Mr. Daly, just tell me one
      thing: isn&rsquo;t Mr. Darcy there as bad as myself, to take all this money for
      his vote?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; said Daly, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that a gentleman born and bred as he is, oughtn&rsquo;t to sell his
      country for goold; that if a blackguard like myself takes to the road,
      it&rsquo;s all natural and reasonable, and the world&rsquo;s little worse off when
      they hang half a dozen of my kind; but for a real born gentleman of the
      old stock of the land to go and take money for his vote in Parliament!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who dares to say he did so?&rdquo; cried Daly, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, that&rsquo;s the story up in Dublin; they say he &lsquo;d no other way of
      clearing off the debts on his property. Bad cess to me if I &lsquo;d do it! Here
      I am, a robber and a highwayman, I don&rsquo;t deny it, but may I wear hemp for
      a handkerchief if I &lsquo;d sell my country. Bad luck to the Union, and all
      that votes for it,&rdquo; said he, as, filling a bumper of whiskey, he tossed it
      off to this laudable sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had n&rsquo;t wronged my friend the Knight of Gwynne, I&rsquo;m not certain
      that I wouldn&rsquo;t have pledged your toast myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he &lsquo;s a friend of yours I say nothing against him; but sure when he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once for all,&rdquo; said Daly, sternly, &ldquo;this story is false;&rdquo; while he added,
      in a low muttering to himself, &ldquo;corruption must needs have spread widely
      when such a calumny was even ventured on.&mdash;And so, Freney, Hickman
      escaped you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did, sir,&rdquo; said Freney, sighing; &ldquo;he made a lodgment in Kildare next
      day, and more of the money he carried up to town, guarded all the way by
      the two fellows I told you. Ah! Mr. Daly, if all the world was as cunning
      as old Peter, I might give up the road as a bad job. There! do you hear
      that? Listen, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Daly, after a moment&rsquo;s silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re my nags, sir, coming up the road. I&rsquo;d know their trot if I heard
      it among a troop of dragoons. &lsquo;T is clippers they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he arose from the table, and, lighting a small lantern he
      always carried with him, hastened to the door, where already the two
      horses were standing, a bare-legged &ldquo;gossoon&rdquo; holding the bridles.

    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jemmy, what &lsquo;s the news to-night?&rdquo; said Freney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, sir, at all. I passed the down mail at Seery&rsquo;s Mill, and when
      the coachman heard the step of the horses, he laid on the wheelers wid all
      his might, and sat down on the footboard, and the two outside passengers
      lay flat as a pancake on the top when I passed. I could n&rsquo;t help giving a
      screech out of me for fun, and the old guard let fly, and sent a ball
      through my &lsquo;caubeen;&rsquo;&rdquo; and as he said these words he exhibited his ragged
      felt hat, which, in addition to its other injuries, now displayed a round
      bullet-hole through either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serve you right,&rdquo; said Freney, harshly; &ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d levelled three
      inches lower. That young rascal, sir, keeps the whole road in a state of
      alarm that stops all business on it.&rdquo; Then he added, in a whisper, &ldquo;but he
      never failed me in his life. I &lsquo;ve only to say when and where I want the
      horses, and I &lsquo;d lay my neck on it he&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daly, who had been for some minutes examining the two horses by the
      lantern with all the skill of an adept, now turned the light full upon the
      figure of the boy whose encomium was thus pronounced. The urchin, as if
      conscious that he was passing an inspection, set his tattered hat jauntily
      on one side, and with one arm a-kimbo, and a leg advanced, stood the very
      perfection of ragged, self-sufficient rascality. Though at most not above
      fourteen years of age, and short in size even for that, his features had
      the shrewd intelligence of manhood; a round, wide head, covered with dark
      red hair, projected over two eyes set wide apart, whose bad expression was
      ingeniously improved by a habit of squinting at pleasure,&mdash;a practice
      with which he now amused himself, as Mr. Daly continued to stare at him.
      His nose, which a wound had partly separated from the forehead, was short
      and wide, leaving an unnatural length to the lower part of the face, where
      an enormous mouth, garnished with large and regular teeth, was seen,&mdash;a
      feature that actually gave a look of ferocity even to a face so young.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain to see what destiny awaits that young scoundrel,&rdquo; said Daly,
      as he gazed almost sadly at the assemblage of bad passions so palpably
      displayed in his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;d wager the young devil knows it himself, and can see the gallows even
      now before him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A wild burst of frantic laughter broke from the urchin as, in the
      exuberance of his merriment, he capered round Daly with gambols the most
      strange and uncouth, and then, mimicking an air of self-admiration, he
      strutted past, while he broke into one of the slang ditties of the day:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;With beauty and manners to plaze,
     I &lsquo;ll seek a rich wife, and I &lsquo;ll find her,
     And live like a Lord all my days,
     And sing, Tally-high-ho the Grinder!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Freney actually screamed with laughter as he watched the mingled
      astonishment and horror depicted in Daly&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fellow&rsquo;s fate will lie heavily on your heart yet,&rdquo; said Daly, in a
      voice whose solemn tones at once arrested Freney&rsquo;s merriment, while the
      &ldquo;gossoon,&rdquo; with increased animation and in a wilder strain, burst forth,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;My Lord cheats at play like a rogue,
     And my Lady flings honor behind her;
     And why wold n&rsquo;t I be in vogue,
     And sing, Tally-high-ho the Grinder!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Daly, turning away, for, amid all his disgust, a sense of the
      ludicrous was stealing over him, and the temptation to laugh was
      struggling in him,&mdash;&ldquo;come, let us be off; you have nothing to wait
      for, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, sir; I&rsquo;m ready this instant. Here, Jemmy, take this portmanteau,
      and meet us outside of Maynooth, under the old castle wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; cried Daly, whose misgivings about the safe arrival of his luggage
      would have made him prefer any other mode of transmission; &ldquo;he &lsquo;ll
      scarcely be in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in time! I wish I&rsquo;d a bet of fifty guineas on it that he would not
      visit every stable on the road, and know every traveller&rsquo;s name and
      business, and yet be a good half hour before us. Off with you! Away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diving under the two horses, the &ldquo;gossoon&rdquo; appeared at the other side of
      the road, and then, with a wild spring in the air, and an unearthly shout
      of laughter, he cleared the fence before him and disappeared, while as he
      went the strain of his slang song still floated in the air, and the
      refrain, &ldquo;Tally-high-ho the Grinder,&rdquo; could be heard through the stillness
      of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the dark horse, sir; you &lsquo;re heavier than me,&rdquo; said Freney, as he
      held the stirrup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A clever hack, faith,&rdquo; said Daly, as he seated himself in the saddle, and
      gathered up the reins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mounts you well,&rdquo; cried Freney, admiring both horse and rider once
      more by the light before he extinguished the lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm had now considerably abated, and they rode on at a brisk pace,
      nor did they draw rein till the tall ruined castle of Maynooth could be
      seen, rearing its dark head against the murky sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We part here,&rdquo; said Daly, who for some time had been lost in thought,
      &ldquo;and I have nothing but thanks to offer you for this night&rsquo;s service,
      Freney; but if the time should come that I can do you a good turn&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll never ask it, sir,&rdquo; said Freney, interrupting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not? Are you too proud?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too proud to be under any obligation to you,&rdquo; said the robber,
      stopping him, &ldquo;but too proud of the honor you did me this night by keeping
      my company, ever to hurt your fame by letting the world know it. No, Mr.
      Daly, I knew your courage well; but this was the bravest thing ever you
      did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sprang from his horse as he spoke, and gave a long, shrill whistle. A
      deep silence followed, and he repeated the signal, and, soon after, the
      tramp of naked feet was heard on the road, and Jemmy advanced towards them
      at his ordinary sling trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the trunk up to the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Daly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that myself;&rdquo; and he relieved the urchin of
      his burden, taking the opportunity to slip some crown-pieces into his
      willing hand while he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, sir,&rdquo; said Freney, taking off his hat with courteous deference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Freney,&rdquo; said Daly, as he seized the robber&rsquo;s hand and shook it
      warmly. &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll soon be shaking hands with twenty fellows not a whit more
      honest,&rdquo; said Daly, as he looked after him through the gloom. &ldquo;Hang me if
      I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s better company, too!&rdquo; and with this very flattering
      reflection on some parties unknown, he plodded along towards the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, again, new disappointment awaited him: a sudden summons had called
      the members of both political parties to the capital, and horses were not
      to be had at any price.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;T is the Lord&rsquo;s marciful providence left him only the one arm,&rdquo; said a
      waiter, as he ushered Daly into a sitting-room, and cast a glance of most
      meaning terror at the retiring figure of Sandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Daly, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what he smashed the best chaise in the yard, as if it was a taycup,
      this morning. Mr. Tisdal ordered it to be ready at seven o&rsquo;clock, to take
      him up to town, and, when it came to the door, up comes that long fellow
      with his one arm, and says, &lsquo;This will do for my master,&rsquo; says he, and
      cool and aisy he gets up into the chaise, and sits down, and when he was
      once there, by my conscience you might as well try to drain the canal with
      a cullender as get him out again! We had a fight that lasted nigh an hour,
      and signs on it, there&rsquo;s many a black eye in the stable-yard to show for
      it; but he beat them all off, and kept his ground. &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Tisdal, and he whispered a word to the master; and what did they do, sir,
      but nailed him up fast in the chaise, and unharnessed the horses, put them
      to a jaunting-car, and started with Mr. Tisdal before you could turn
      round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Sandy,&rdquo; cried Daly, &ldquo;what did he do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sandy?&mdash;av it&rsquo;s that you call him,&mdash;a divil a doubt but he&rsquo;s
      sandy and stony too,&mdash;he made a drive at the front panel wid one leg,
      and away it went; and he smashed open the door with his fist; and put that
      short stump of an arm through the wood as if it was cheese. &lsquo;T is a holy
      show, the same chaise now! And when he got out, may I never spread a
      tablecloth if you&rsquo;d see a crayture in the street: they run in every
      direction, as if it was the duke&rsquo;s bull was out of the paddock, and it&rsquo;s
      only a while ago he grew raysonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However little satisfactory the exploit was to the innkeeper and his
      household, it seemed to sharpen Daly&rsquo;s enjoyment of his breakfast, and
      compensate him for the delay to which he was condemned. The messenger sent
      to seek for horses returned at last without them, and there was now no
      alternative but to await, with such patience as he could muster, some
      chaise for town, and thus reach Dublin before nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      A return chaise from Kilcock was at last secured, and Daly, with his
      servant on the box, proceeded towards Dublin.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dark when they reached the capital, and drove with all the speed
      they could accomplish to the Knight&rsquo;s house in Henrietta Street. Great was
      Daly&rsquo;s discomfort to learn that his friend Darcy had just driven from the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; said he, as he held his watch in his hand, as if considering
      the chances of still overtaking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a dinner-party, sir, at Lord Castlereagh&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Lord Castlereagh&rsquo;s!&rdquo; And nothing but the presence of the man repressed
      the passionate exclamation that quivered on his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, his Lordship and Mr. Heffernan called here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Heffernan,&mdash;Mr. Con Heffernan do you mean?&rdquo; interrupted he,
      quickly. &ldquo;Ah! I have it now. And when was this visit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Monday last, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Monday,&rdquo; said Daly to himself. &ldquo;The very day the letter was written to
      me: there&rsquo;s something in it, after all. Drive to Kildare Place, and as
      fast as you can,&rdquo; said he, aloud, as he sprang into the chaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steps were up, the door banged to, the horses lashed into a gallop,
      and the next moment saw the chaise at the end of the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Short as the distance was,&mdash;scarcely a mile to Heffer-nan&rsquo;s house,&mdash;Daly&rsquo;s
      impatient anxiety made him think it an eternity. His object was to reach
      the house before Heffernan started; for he judged rightly that not only
      was the Secretary&rsquo;s dinner planned by that astute gentleman, but that its
      whole conduct and machinery rested on his dexterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the fellow well,&rdquo; muttered Daly,&mdash;&ldquo;ay, and, by Heaven! he
      knows <i>me</i>. His mock candor and his counterfeit generosity have but a
      bad chance with such men as myself; but Darcy&rsquo;s open, unsuspecting
      temperament is the very metal he can weld and fashion to his liking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was in the midst of reflections like these, mingled with passionate
      bursts of impatience at the pace, which was, notwithstanding, a sharp
      gallop, that they dashed up to Heffer-nan&rsquo;s door. To make way for them, a
      chariot that stood there was obliged to move on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose carriage is this?&rdquo; said Daly, as, without waiting for the steps to
      be lowered, he sprang to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Heffernan&rsquo;s, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is at home, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; but just about to leave for a dinner-party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand by that chariot, Sandy, and take care that no one enters it till I
      come back,&rdquo; whispered Daly in his servant&rsquo;s ear. And Sandy took up bis
      post at the door like a sentinel on duty. &ldquo;Tell your master,&rdquo; said Daly to
      the servant, who stood at the open hall-door, &ldquo;that a gentleman desires to
      speak with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just going out, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give my message,&rdquo; said Daly, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With what name, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Repeat the words as I have given them to you, and don&rsquo;t dictate to me how
      I am to announce myself,&rdquo; said he, harshly, as he opened the door and
      walked into the parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had he reached the fireplace when a bustle without proclaimed
      that Heffernan was passing downstairs, and the confused sound of voices
      was heard as he and his servant spoke together. &ldquo;Ah! very well,&rdquo; said
      Heffernan, aloud; &ldquo;you may tell the gentleman, John, that I can&rsquo;t see him
      at present. I &lsquo;ve no notion of keeping dinner waiting half an hour.&rdquo; And
      so saying, he passed out to enter the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na, na,&rdquo; said Sandy, as the footman offered his arm to assist his master
      to mount the steps; &ldquo;ye maun wait a wee. I trow ye hae no seen my master
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What means this insolence? Who is this fellow?&mdash;push him aside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s na sae easy to do,&rdquo; replied Sandy, gravely; &ldquo;and though I hae but
      one arm, ye &lsquo;ll no be proud of yer-sel &lsquo;gin you try the game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you? By what right do you stop me here?&rdquo; said Heffernan, who,
      contrary to his wont, was already in a passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Bagenal Daly&rsquo;s man; and there&rsquo;s himsel in the parlor, and he&rsquo;ll tell
      you mair, maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mention of that name seemed to act like a spell upon Heffernan, and,
      without waiting for another word, he turned back hastily, and re-entered
      the house. He stopped as he laid his hand on the handle of the door, and
      his face, when the light fell on it, was pale as death; and although no
      other sign of agitation was perceptible, the expression of his features
      was very different from ordinary. The pause, brief as it was, seemed
      sufficient to rally him, for, opening the door with an appearance of
      haste, he advanced towards Daly, and, with an outstretched hand,
      exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Daly, I little knew who it was I declined to see. They gave
      me no name, and I was just stepping into my carriage when your servant
      told me you were here. I need not tell you that I would not deny myself to
      <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe not, sir,&rdquo; said Daly, with a strong emphasis on the words. &ldquo;I
      have come a long journey to see and speak with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask it, as a great favor, that you will let our interview be for
      to-morrow morning? You may name your hour, or as many of them as you like&mdash;or
      will you dine with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We &lsquo;ll dine together to-day, sir,&rdquo; said Daly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; said Heffernan, with a smile which all his tact could
      not make an easy one. &ldquo;I have been engaged for four days to Lord
      Castlereagh,&mdash;a party which I had some share in assembling together,&mdash;and,
      indeed, already I am five-and-twenty minutes late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret deeply, sir,&rdquo; said Daly, as, crossing his hands behind his back,
      he slowly walked up and down the room,&mdash;&ldquo;I regret deeply that I must
      deprive the noble Secretary&rsquo;s dinner-party of so very gifted a guest. I
      know something of Mr. Heffernan&rsquo;s entertaining powers, and I have heard
      even more of them; but for all that, I must be unrelenting, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing is really impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will dine with me to-day,&rdquo; was the cool answer of Daly, as, fixing
      his eyes steadily on him, he uttered the words in a low, determined tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once for all, sir&mdash;&rdquo; said Heffernan, as he moved towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once for all,&rdquo; repeated Daly, &ldquo;I will have my way. This is no piece of
      caprice,&mdash;no sudden outbreak of that eccentricity which you and
      others affect to fasten on me. No, Mr. Heffernan; I have come a hundred
      and fifty miles with an object, and not all the wily dexterity of even you
      shall balk me. To be plain, sir, there are reports current in the clubs
      and society generally that you have been the means of securing the Knight
      of Gwynne to the side of Government. I know&mdash;ay, and you know&mdash;how
      many of these rumors originate on the shallow foundation of men being seen
      together in public, and cultivating an intimacy on purely social grounds.
      Now, Mr. Heffernan, Darcy&rsquo;s opinions, it is well known, are not those of
      the Ministry, and the only result of such calumnies will be that he, the
      head of a family, and a country gentleman of the highest rank, will be
      drawn into a dangerous altercation with some of those lounging puppies
      that circulate such slanders. I am his friend, and, as it happens, with no
      such ties to life and station as he possesses. I will, if possible, place
      myself in a similar position, and, to do so, I know no readier road than
      by keeping your company. I will give the gentlemen every pretext to talk
      of me as they have done of him; and if I hear a mutter, or if I see a
      signal that the most suspicious nature can torture into an affront, I will
      teach the parties that if they let their tongues run glibly, they at least
      shall keep their hair-triggers in order. Now, sir, you &lsquo;ll not only dine
      with me to-day, but you &lsquo;ll do so in the large room of the Club. I &lsquo;ve
      given you my reasons, and I tell you flatly that I will hear nothing in
      opposition to them; for I am quite ready to open the ball with Mr. Con
      Heffernan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heffernan&rsquo;s courage had been proved on more than one occasion; but,
      somehow, he had his own reasons, it would seem, for declining the gage of
      battle here. That they were valid ones would appear from the evident
      struggle compliance cost him, as, with a quivering lip and whisper, he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There may be much force in what you say, Mr. Daly,&mdash;your motives, at
      least, are unquestionable. I will offer, therefore, no further
      opposition.&rdquo; So saying, he opened the door to permit Daly to pass out. &ldquo;To
      the Club,&rdquo; said he to the footman, as they both seated themselves in the
      chariot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Club, sir!&rdquo; repeated the astonished servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to Daly&rsquo;s Club,&rdquo; said Bagenal himself. And they drove off.

      CHAPTER XVIII. LORD CASTLEREAGH&rsquo;S DINNER-PARTY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day of Lord Castlereagh&rsquo;s dinner-party had arrived, and the guests,
      all save Mr. Heffernan, were assembled in the drawing-room. The party was
      small and select, and his Lordship had gone through the usual routine of
      introducings, when Hamilton asked if he still expected any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Mr. Heffernan promised to make one of our twelve; he is generally
      punctuality itself, and I cannot understand what detains him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he &lsquo;d call for me on his way,&rdquo; said Lord Beerhaven, &ldquo;and I waited
      some time for him; but as I would not risk spoiling your Lordship&rsquo;s <i>entrées</i>,
      I came away at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech was made by one who felt no small uneasiness on his own part
      respecting the cookery, and took the occasion of suggesting his fears, as
      a hint to order dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we vote him present, then?&rdquo; said Lord Castle-reagh, who saw the
      look of dismay the further prospect of waiting threw over the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; said Lord Beerhaven; &ldquo;Heffernan never eats soup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he cares much for fish, either,&rdquo; said Hamilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think our friend Con is fond of walnuts,&rdquo; said the Knight, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them &lsquo;s the unwholesomest things he could eat,&rdquo; muttered old Hickman,
      who, although seated in a corner of the room, and partly masked by his son
      and grandson, could not be altogether secluded from earshot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they indeed?&rdquo; said the bishop, turning sharply round; for the theme
      of health was one that engaged all his sympathies; and although his short
      apron covered a goodly rotundity of form, eating exacted to the full as
      many pains as it afforded pleasures to the Churchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my Lord,&rdquo; said Hickman, highly gratified to obtain such exalted
      notice; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s an essential oil in them that destroys the mucous
      membrane&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Destroys the mucous membrane!&rdquo; said the bishop, interrupting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine is pretty much in that way already,&rdquo; said Lord Beerhaven,
      querulously; &ldquo;five-and-twenty minutes past six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my dear Darcy,&rdquo; said Lord Drogheda, who, having drawn the Knight
      aside, was speaking in an earnest but low tone, &ldquo;I never was easier in my
      life, on the score of money; don&rsquo;t let the thing give you any trouble;
      consult Gleeson about it, he&rsquo;s a clever fellow, and take your own time for
      the payment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gleeson is a clever fellow, my Lord, but there are straits that prove too
      much even for his ingenuity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I know what you mean,&rdquo; said Lord Drogheda, secretly, &ldquo;you &lsquo;ve heard
      of that Spanish-American affair,&mdash;yes, he made a bad hit there; some
      say he&rsquo;ll lose fifty thousand by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was at this moment announced, and the Knight was unable to learn
      further on a subject the little he had heard of which gave him great
      sorrow. Unfortunately, too, his position at table was opposite, not next,
      to Lord Drogheda, and he was thus compelled to wait for another
      opportunity of interrogating him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Castlereagh has left behind him one reputation which no political or
      party animosity has ever availed to detract from, that of being the most
      perfect host that ever dispensed the honors of a table. Whatever seeming
      reserve or coldness he maintained at other times, here he was courteous to
      cordiality; his manner, the happy union of thorough good-breeding and
      friendly ease. Gifted with a most retentive memory, and well versed on
      almost every topic that could arise, he possessed that most difficult art,
      the power of developing the resources and information of others, without
      ever making any parade of his own acquirements; or, what is still harder,
      without betraying the effort which, in hands less adroit, becomes the most
      vulgar of all tricks, called &ldquo;drawing out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With all these advantages, and well suited as he was to meet every
      emergency of a social meeting, he felt on the present occasion far less at
      ease than was his wont. The party was one of Heffernan&rsquo;s contriving,&mdash;the
      elements were such as he himself would never have dreamed of collecting
      together,&mdash;and he relied upon his &ldquo;ancient&rdquo; to conduct the plan he
      had so skilfully laid down. It was, as he muttered to himself,
      &ldquo;Heffernan&rsquo;s Bill,&rdquo; and he was not coming forward to explain its
      provisions or state its object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily for the success of such meetings in general, the adjuncts
      contribute almost equally with the intellectual resources of the party;
      and here Heffernan, although absent, had left a trace of his skill. The
      dinner was admirable. Lord Castlereagh knew nothing of such matters; the
      most simple, nay, the most ill-dressed, meats would have met equal
      approval from him with the greatest triumphs of the art; and as to wine,
      he mixed up his madeira, his claret, and his burgundy together in a
      fashion which sadly deteriorated him in the estimation of many of his more
      cultivated acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the detail of the dinner was perfect, and Lord Beer-haven, his fears
      on that score allayed, emerged from the cloud of his own dreary
      anticipations, and became one of the pleasantest of the party. And thus
      the influence of good cheer and easy converse extended its happy sway
      until even Mr. Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly began to suffer less anxiety respecting
      his father&rsquo;s presence, and felt relieved at the preoccupation the good
      things of the table exacted from the old doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party was of that magnitude which, while enabling the guests to form
      into the twos and threes of conversational intimacy, yet affords, from
      time to time, the opportunity of generalizing the subject discussed, and
      drawing, as it were, into a common centre the social abilities of each.
      And there Lord Castlereagh shone conspicuously, for at the same time that
      he called forth all the anecdotic stores of Lord Beerhaven, and the witty
      repartee for which Hamilton was noted, he shrouded the obtrusive old
      Hickman, or gave a character of quaint originality to remarks which, with
      less flattering introduction, had been deemed low-lived and vulgar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wine went freely round, and claret, whose flavor might have found
      acceptance with the most critical, began to work its influence upon the
      party, producing that pleasant amalgamation in which individual
      peculiarities are felt to be the attractive, and not the repelling,
      properties of social intercourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What splendid action that horse you drive has, Mr. Beecham O&rsquo;Reilly,&rdquo;
       said Lord Loughdooner, who had paid the most marked attention to him
      during dinner. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the style of moving they &lsquo;re so mad after in
      London,&mdash;high and fast at the same time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave three hundred and fifty for him,&rdquo; lisped out the youth,
      carelessly, &ldquo;and think him cheap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheap at three hundred and fifty!&rdquo; exclaimed old Hickman, who had heard
      the fact for the first time. &ldquo;May I never stir from the spot, but you told
      me forty pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you can pick up another at that price let me know, I beg you,&rdquo; said
      Lord Loughdooner, coming to the rescue, and with a smile that seemed to
      say, &ldquo;How well you quizzed the old gentleman! I say, Hamilton, who bought
      your gray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ecclesmere bought him for his uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he starts, or shies, or something of that sort, don&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my Lord, he &lsquo;comes down,&rsquo; which is what the uncle does not; and as he
      stands between Ecclesmere and the Marquisate&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve always maintained,&rdquo; said the bishop to Lord Castlereagh.
      &ldquo;The potato disposes to acidity. I know the poor people correct that by
      avoiding animal food,&mdash;a most invaluable fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are good grounds for your remark,&rdquo; said Lord Castlereagh to the
      Knight, while he smiled an easy assent to the bishop, without attending to
      him, &ldquo;and the social relations of the country will demand the earliest
      care of the Government whenever measures of immediate importance permit
      this consideration. We have been unfortunate in not drawing closer to us
      men who, like yourself, are thoroughly acquainted with the condition of
      the people generally. It is not too late&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late for what?&rdquo; interrupted Lord Drogheda. &ldquo;Not too late for more
      claret, I trust; and the decanter has been standing opposite to me these
      ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pardons!&mdash;O&rsquo;Reilly, will you touch that bell? Thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of easy familiarity with which he spoke covered Hickman with a
      flush of ecstatic pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ginger them up so, nowadays,&rdquo; said Lord Loughdooner to Beecham
      O&rsquo;Reilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ginger!&rdquo; chimed in Hickman,&mdash;&ldquo;the devil a finer thing for the
      stomach. I ask your pardon, my Lord, for saying his name, but I &lsquo;ll give
      you a receipt for the windy bile worth a guinea-note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a pinch of snuff, Dr. Hickman,&rdquo; said Lord Castle-reagh, who saw the
      mortification of the two generations at the old man&rsquo;s vulgarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my Lord. &lsquo;Tis blackguard I like best: them brown snuffs ruins
      the nose entirely.&mdash;I was saying about the mixture,&rdquo; said he,
      addressing the bishop. &ldquo;Take a pint of infusion of gentian, and put a
      pinch of coriander seeds, and the peel of a Chaney orange&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I recommend a bumper of that claret, my Lord,&rdquo; said Lord Castlereagh,
      determined to cut short the prescription, which now was being listened to
      by the whole board; &ldquo;and when I add the health of the primate, I &lsquo;m sure
      you &lsquo;ll not refuse me.&rdquo; The toast was drunk with all suitable honors, and
      the Secretary resumed in a whisper: &ldquo;He wants our best wishes on that
      score, poor fellow, if they could serve him. He&rsquo;s not long to be with us,
      I fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, my Lord!&rdquo; said the bishop, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! too true,&rdquo; sighed Lord Castlereagh; &ldquo;he &lsquo;ll be a severe loss, too.
      I wanted to have some minutes&rsquo; talk with you on the matter. These are
      times of no common emergency, and the men we promote are of great
      consequence at this moment. Say to-morrow, about one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll be punctual,&rdquo; said the bishop, taking out his tablets to make a
      note of what his memory would retain to the end of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Castlereagh caught the Knight&rsquo;s eye at the instant, and they both
      smiled, without being able to control their emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said Lord Castlereagh, hastening to conceal his laugh, &ldquo;my young
      relation continues to enjoy the hospitalities of your house. I don&rsquo;t doubt
      in the least that he reckons that wound the luckiest incident of his
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend Darcy paid even more dearly for it,&rdquo; said Lord Drogheda,
      overhearing the remark; &ldquo;but for Heffernan&rsquo;s tidings, I should certainly
      have lost my wager.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, Knight,&rdquo; broke in Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly, &ldquo;it was through no
      fault of mine that the altercation ended so seriously. I visited Captain
      Forester in his room, and thought I obtained his pledge to take no further
      notice of the affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, too, told him the style of fellow MacDonough was,&rdquo; said Beecham,
      affectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard honorable mention of both facts, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Darcy,
      dryly; &ldquo;that nothing could have less contributed to a breach of the peace
      than Mr. Beecham O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s conduct, my friend Daly is willing to vouch
      for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish his own had been equally prudent and pacific,&rdquo; said Hickman
      O&rsquo;Reilly, reddening at the taunt conveyed in the Knight&rsquo;s speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daly is unquestionably the best friend on the ground&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On or off the ground, my Lord Loughdooner,&rdquo; interrupted the Knight,
      warmly; &ldquo;he may be, now and then, somewhat hasty or rash; but rich as our
      country is in men of generous natures, Bagenal Daly is second to none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I protest, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the bishop, gravely; &ldquo;I wish I could hear a
      better reason for the panegyric than his skill as a duellist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True for you, my Lord,&rdquo; muttered old Hickman, in a whisper; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s readier
      with a pistol-bullet than with the interest on his bond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He &lsquo;d favor you with a discharge in full, sir, if he heard the
      observation,&rdquo; said Hamilton, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter, my Lord,&rdquo; said a servant, presenting a sealed epistle to the
      Secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heffernan&rsquo;s writing, gentlemen, so I shall, with your permission, read
      it.&rdquo; He broke the seal, and read aloud: &ldquo;&lsquo;My dear Lord,&mdash;An
      adventure, which would be laughable if it were not so provoking, prevents
      my coming to dinner, so I must leave the menagerie&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo; Here he
      dropped his voice, and, crumpling up the letter, laughingly remarked, &ldquo;Oh,
      we shall hear it all later on, I &lsquo;ve no doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the by, my Lord, there&rsquo;s a House to-night, is there not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, bishop; we moved an adjournment for to-morrow evening. You &lsquo;ll come
      down for the debate, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bishop nodded significantly, and sipped his wine. There was now a
      pause. This was the great topic of the day, and yet, up to this moment,
      not even a chance allusion to politics had been dropped, and all recoiled
      from adventuring, even by a word, on a theme which might lead to
      disagreement or discordance. Old Hickman, however, dated his origin in
      life too far back for such scruples, and, leaning across the table, said,
      with an accent to which wine imparted a tone of peculiar cunning, &ldquo;I wish
      you well through it, my Lord; for, by all accounts, it is dirty work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The roar of laughter that followed the speech actually shook the table,
      Lord Castlereagh giving way to it with as much zest as the guests
      themselves. Twice he essayed to speak, but each time a fresh burst of
      mirth interrupted him, while old Hickman, unable to divine the source of
      the merriment, stared at each person in turn, and at last muttered his
      consolatory &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; but with a voice that showed he was far from feeling
      satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d made that speech in the House, Mr. Hickman,&rdquo; said Lord
      Drogheda; &ldquo;I do believe you&rsquo;d have been the most popular man in Ireland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; said Lord Castlereagh, wiping his eyes, &ldquo;I cannot conceive a
      more dangerous opponent to the Bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he held your own bill, with a protest on it,&rdquo; whispered Hamilton,
      &ldquo;your opinion would not be easily gainsaid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask for a cup of coffee?&rdquo; said the bishop, rising, for he saw that
      although as yet no untoward results had followed, at any moment something
      unpleasant might occur. The party rose with him, and adjourned to the
      drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Singular old man!&rdquo; said Lord Castlereagh, in a whisper to the Knight.
      &ldquo;Shrewd and cunning, no doubt, but scarcely calculated, as our friend
      Drogheda thinks, to distinguish himself in the House of Commons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think the Upper House would suit him better, my Lord?&rdquo; said Darcy,
      slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, Knight,&rdquo; said Lord Castlereagh, laughing, &ldquo;you have caught up the
      popular joke of the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust, my Lord, it may be no more than a joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you doubt it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the present moment,&rdquo; said the Knight, gravely, &ldquo;I see no reason for
      doubting anything merely on the score of its unlikelihood; your Lordship&rsquo;s
      colleagues have given us some sharp lessons on the subject of credulity,
      and we should be more unteachable than the savage if we had not learnt
      something by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Castlereagh was about to answer, when Lord Drogheda came forward to
      say &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo; The others were going too, and in the bustle of
      leave-taking some moments were passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your carriage has not come yet, sir,&rdquo; replied a servant to the Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we take you home, Darcy,&rdquo; said Lord Drogheda; &ldquo;or are you going to
      the Club?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me say no to that offer, Knight,&rdquo; interposed Lord Castlereagh, &ldquo;and
      give me the pleasure of your company till the carriage arrives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darcy acceded to a request, the courteous mode of making which had already
      secured its acceptance, and the Knight sat down at the fire <i>tête-à-tête</i>
      with the Secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was most anxious for a moment like this,&rdquo; said Lord Castlereagh, with
      the air of one abandoning himself to the full liberty of sincerity. &ldquo;It
      very seldom happens to men placed like myself to have even a few brief
      minutes&rsquo; intercourse with any out of the rank of partisans or opponents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not disguise from you how highly I should value the alliance of
      yourself to our party; I place the greatest price upon such support, but
      there is something better and more valuable than even a vote in a strong
      division, and that is, the candid judgment of a man who has enjoyed your
      opportunities and your powers of forming an opinion. Tell me now, frankly,&mdash;for
      we are here in all freedom of intercourse,&mdash;what do you object to?
      What do you fear from this contemplated enactment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me rather hear,&rdquo; said the Knight, smiling, &ldquo;what do you hope from it,&mdash;how
      you propose it to become the remedy of our existing evils? Because I shall
      thereby see whether your Lordship and myself are like-minded on the score
      of the disease, before we begin to discuss the remedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so, then,&rdquo; said the Secretary, gayly; and at once, without
      hesitation, he commenced a short and most explicit statement of the
      Government intentions. Arguments that formed the staple of long
      Parliamentary harangues he condensed into a sentence or two; views that,
      dilated upon, sufficed to fill the columns of a newspaper, he displayed
      palpably and boldly, exhibiting powers of clear and rapid eloquence for
      which so few gave him credit in public life. Not an epithet nor an
      expression could have been retrenched from a detail which denoted
      faculties of admirable training, assisted by a memory almost miraculous.
      Stating in order the various objections to the measure, he answered each
      in turn; and wherever the reply was not sufficiently ample and conclusive,
      he adroitly took occasion to undervalue either the opinion or the source
      from which it originated, exhibiting, while restraining, considerable
      powers of sarcasm, and a thorough insight into the character of the public
      men of the period.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Knight was unconvinced by the arguments, he was no less astonished
      by the abilities of the Secretary. Up to that hour he had been a follower
      of the popular notion of the Opposition party, which agreed in decrying
      his talents, and making his displays as a speaker the touchstone of his
      capacity. Darcy was too clever himself to linger longer in this delusion.
      He saw the great and varied resources of the youthful statesman tested by
      a question of no common difficulty, and he could not control the
      temptation of telling him, as he concluded,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made me a convert to the union&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I, indeed?&rdquo; cried the Secretary, in an ecstasy of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear me out, my Lord,&mdash;to the union of great political abilities
      with the most captivating powers of conversation. Yes, my Lord, I am old
      enough to make such a remark without the hazard of being deemed
      impertinent or a flatterer,&mdash;<i>your</i> success in life is certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Bill!&rdquo; cried Lord Castlereagh, while his handsome face was
      flushed between delight and eagerness,&mdash;&ldquo;the Bill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is an admirable Bill for England, my Lord, and were there not two sides
      to a contract, would be perfect,&mdash;indeed, until I heard the lucid
      statement you have just made, I never saw one-tenth part of the advantages
      it must render to your country, nor, consequently,&mdash;for we move not
      in parallel lines,&mdash;the great danger with which it is fraught to
      mine. Let me now explain more fully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words the Knight entered upon the question of the Union in all
      its relations to Ireland; and while never conceding, nor even extenuating,
      the difficulties attendant upon a double legislature, he proceeded to show
      the probable train of events that must result on the passing of the
      measure, strengthening his anticipations by facts derived from deep
      knowledge of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far be it from us to endeavor to recapitulate his arguments: some of them,
      now forgotten, were difficult enough to answer; others, treasured up, have
      been fashionable fallacies in our own day. Such as they were, they were
      the reasons why an Irish gentleman demurred to surrendering privileges
      that gave his own country rank, place, and preeminence, without the
      evidence of any certain or adequate compensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not tell me, my Lord, that we shall hold our influence and our station
      in the Imperial Parliament. There are many reasons against such a belief.
      We shall be in the minority, a great minority; a minority branded with
      provincialism as our badge, and accused of prejudice and
      narrow-sightedness, from the very fact of our nationality. No, no; we
      shall occupy a very different position in your country: and who will take
      our places here? That&rsquo;s a point your Lordship has not touched upon, but I
      &lsquo;ll tell you. The demagogue, the public disturber, the licensed hawker of
      small grievances, every briefless lawyer of bad fortune and worse
      language, every mendicant patriot that can minister to the passions of a
      people deserted by their natural protectors,&mdash;the day will come, my
      Lord, when these men will grow ambitious, their aspirings may become
      troublesome; if you coerce them, they are martyrs,&mdash;conciliate them,
      and they are privileged. What will happen then? You will be asked to
      repeal the Union, you will be charged with all the venality by which you
      carried your Bill, every injustice with which it is chargeable, and with a
      hundred other faults and crimes with which it is unconnected. You will be
      asked, I say, to repeal the Union, and make of this miserable rabble,
      these dregs and sweepings of party, a Parliament. You shake your head. No,
      no, it is by no means impossible,&mdash;nay, I don&rsquo;t think it even remote.
      I speak as an old man, and age, if it have many deficiencies as regards
      the past, has at least some prophetic foresight for the future. You will
      be asked to repeal the Union, to give a Parliament to a country which you
      have drained of its wealth, from which you have seduced the aristocracy;
      to restore a deliberative body to a land whose resources for
      self-legislation you have studiously and industriously ruined. Think,
      then, twice of a measure from which, if it fail, there is no retreat, and
      the opposition to which may come in a worse form than a vote in the House
      of Commons. I see you deem my anticipations have more gloom than
      truthfulness; I hope it may be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Knight of Gwynne&rsquo;s carriage,&rdquo; cried a servant, throwing wide the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How opportune!&rdquo; said Darcy, laughing; &ldquo;it is so satisfactory to have the
      last shot at the enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t go yet,&mdash;a few moments more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a second, my Lord; I dare not. The fact is, I have strenuously
      avoided this subject; an old friend of mine, Bagenal Daly, has wearied me
      of it,&mdash;he is an Anti-Unionist, but on grounds I scarcely concur in.
      Your Lordship&rsquo;s defence of the measure I also demur to. I am like poor old
      Murray, the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, who, when called on for his
      opinion in a case where Judge Wallace was in favor of a rule, and Judge
      Mayne against it, he said, &lsquo;I agree with my brother Mayne for the cogent
      reasons laid down by my brother Wallace.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said the Secretary, laughing heartily, &ldquo;I have convinced you against
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, my Lord. I came here this evening intending not to vote on the
      Bill,&mdash;indeed, I accepted your Lordship&rsquo;s hospitality without a
      thought upon a party question; I am equally certain you will acquit me of
      being a spy in the camp. To-morrow I intend to vote against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could have the same esteem for my friends that I now pledge for
      my&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;enemy,&rsquo; my Lord; we both aspire to the same end,&mdash;our
      country&rsquo;s good. If we take different roads, it is because each thinks his
      own path the shortest. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Castlereagh accompanied the Knight to his carriage, and again shook
      his hand cordially as they parted.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. A DAY OF EXCITEMENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Great was the Knight&rsquo;s astonishment, and not less his satisfaction, as he
      entered the breakfast-room the morning after his dinner with the
      Secretary, to find Bagenal Daly there before him. They met with all the
      cordial warmth of men whose friendship had continued without interruption
      for nigh half a century; each well disposed to prize good faith and
      integrity at a time when so many lapsed from the path of honor and
      principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Darcy,&rdquo; cried Daly, the first greetings over, &ldquo;there is little hope
      left us; that rascally newspaper already proclaims the triumph,&mdash;a
      majority of twenty-eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They calculate on many more; you remember what old Hayes, of the
      Recruiting Staff, used to say: &lsquo;There was no getting fellows to enlist
      when the bounty was high; make it half-a-crown,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and I &lsquo;ll raise
      a battalion in a fortnight.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Castlereagh adopting the policy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and with infinite success! Some that held out for English Peerages
      are fain to take Irish Baronetcies, expectant Bishops put up with
      Deaneries, and an acquaintance of ours, that would take nothing below a
      separate command, is now satisfied to make his son a clerk in the War
      Office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m sorry for it,&rdquo; said Daly, as he arose and paced the room backwards
      and forwards, &ldquo;sincerely sorry. I had fostered the hope that if they
      succeeded in corrupting <i>our</i> gentry, they had polluted <i>their own</i>
      Peerage. I wish every fellow had been bought by an Earldom at least. I
      would like to think that this Judas Peerage might become a jest and a
      scoff among their order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have no such expectation, Bagenal,&rdquo; said the Knight, reflectively; &ldquo;their
      origin will be forgiven before the first generation dies out. To all
      purposes of worldly respect and esteem, they &lsquo;ll be as high and mighty
      Lords as the best blood of all the Howards. The penalty will fall upon
      England in another form.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the Lower House, politics will become a trade to live by, and the
      Irish party, with such an admirable market for grievances, will be a
      strong and compact body in Parliament, too numerous to be bought by
      anything save great concessions. Englishmen will never understand the
      truth of the condition of the country from these men, nor how little
      personal importance they possess at home. They will be regarded as the
      exponents of Irish opinion; they will browbeat, denounce, threaten, fawn,
      and flatter by turns; and Ireland, instead of being easier to govern, will
      be rendered ten times more difficult, by all the obscuring influences of
      falsehood and misrepresentation. But let us quit the theme. How have you
      left all at the Abbey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well and happy; here are my despatches.&rdquo; And he laid on the table several
      letters, the first the Knight had received since his arrival, save a few
      hurried lines from Lady Eleanor. Darcy broke the envelopes, and skimmed
      the contents of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good!&rdquo; cried he, handing Lord Netherby&rsquo;s letter across the table;
      &ldquo;this is really amusing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen it,&rdquo; said Daly, dryly. &ldquo;Lady Eleanor asked my opinion as to
      what answer she should make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insolent old miser!&rdquo; broke in Darcy, who, without attending to Daly&rsquo;s
      remark, had been reading Lady Eleanor&rsquo;s account of Dr. Hickman&rsquo;s proposal.
      &ldquo;I say, Bagenal, you &lsquo;ll not believe this. What social earthquakes are we
      to look for next? Read that.&rdquo; And with a trembling hand he presented the
      letter to Daly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Knight&rsquo;s passion had been more openly displayed, Daly&rsquo;s indignation
      seemed to evoke deeper emotion, for his brows met, and his stern lips were
      clenched, as he perused the lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darcy,&rdquo; said he, at length, &ldquo;O&rsquo;Reilly must apologize for this; he must be
      made to disavow any share in the old man&rsquo;s impertinence&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; interrupted Darcy, &ldquo;never speak of it again; rest assured that
      Lady Eleanor received the offer suitably. The best thing we can do is to
      forget it. If,&rdquo; added he, after a pause, &ldquo;the daring that prompted such a
      proposition has not a deeper foundation than mere presumption. You know
      these Hickmans have purchased up my bonds and other securities?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Gleeson is making arrangements for the payment. One large sum,
      something like £20,000&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was paid the day before yesterday,&rdquo; said Daly; &ldquo;here is a memorandum of
      the moneys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How the deuce came you by the information? I have heard nothing of it
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That entails somewhat of a story,&rdquo; said Daly; &ldquo;but I &lsquo;ll be brief with
      it.&rdquo; And in a few words he narrated his meeting with the robber Freney,
      and how he had availed himself of his hospitality and safe convoy as far
      as Maynooth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ireland forever!&rdquo; said the Knight, in a burst of happy laughter; &ldquo;for
      every species of incongruity, where was ever its equal? An independent
      member of the Legislature sups with a highwayman, and takes a loan of his
      hackney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, faith,&rdquo; said Daly, joining in the laugh; &ldquo;and had I not been one of
      the Opposition, I had been worth robbing, and consequently not so civilly
      treated. By Jove! Darcy, I felt an evening with Freney to be a devilish
      good preparation for the company I should be keeping up in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager ten pounds you talked politics together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we did, and he is as stout an Anti-Unionist as the best of us,
      though he told me he signed a petition in favor of the Bill when confined
      in Clonmel jail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that true, Bagenal? did they hawk a petition for signature among the
      prisoners of a jail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took his oath of it to me, and I intend to declare it in the House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if asked for your authority?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll give it,&rdquo; said Daly, determinedly. &ldquo;Ay, faith, and if I catch a
      sneer or a scoff amongst them, I &lsquo;ll tell them that a highwayman is about
      as respectable and somewhat more courageous than a bribed representative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If the Knight enjoyed the absurdity of Daly&rsquo;s supper with the noted
      Freney, he laughed till the tears came at the account of his dining with
      Con Heffernan. Darcy could appreciate the dismay of Heffernan, and the
      cool, imperturbable tyranny of Daly&rsquo;s manner throughout, and would have
      given largely to have witnessed the <i>tête-à-tête</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do him the justice to say,&rdquo; said Daly, &ldquo;that when he found escape
      impossible, he behaved as well as any man, his conversation was easy and
      unaffected, and his manner perfectly well-bred. Freney was more anecdotic,
      but Heffernan saw deeper into mankind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you hinted the comparison?&rdquo; said Darcy, slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I observed upon the superiority practical men possess in all the
      relations of social intercourse, and quoted Freney and himself as
      instances!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he took it well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirably. Once, and only once, did he show a little disposition to turn
      restive; it was when I remarked upon the discrepancy in point of destiny,
      the one being employed to empty, the other to fill, the pockets of his
      Majesty&rsquo;s lieges. He winced, but it was over in a second. His time was up
      at ten o&rsquo;clock, but we sat chatting till near twelve, and we parted with
      what the French term a &lsquo;sense of the most distinguished consideration&rsquo; on
      each side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! I envy the fellows who sat at the other tables and saw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were most discreet in their observations,&rdquo; remarked Daly,
      significantly. &ldquo;One young fellow, it is true, coughed twice or thrice as a
      signal to a friend across the room, but I ordered the waiter to bring me a
      plate, and, taking three or four bullets out of my pocket, sent them over
      to him, with my respectful compliments, as &lsquo;admirable pills for a cough.&rsquo;
      The cure was miraculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent! Men have taken out a patent for a poorer remedy. And now,
      Bagenal, for the reason of your journey. What, in the name of everything
      strange and eccentric, brought you up to town? Don&rsquo;t affect to tell me you
      came for the debate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; said Daly, who, unwilling to reveal the true cause,
      preferred to do battle on this pretence. &ldquo;I admit as freely as ever I did,
      I&rsquo;m no lover of Parliament. I have slight respect or esteem for
      deliberative assemblies split up into factions and parties. A Government,
      to my thinking, should represent unity as the chief element of strength;
      but such as it is,&mdash;bad enough and base enough, in all conscience,&mdash;yet
      it is the last remnant of national power left, the frail barrier between
      us and downright provincialism. But I had another reason for coming up,&mdash;half-a-dozen
      other reasons, for that matter,&mdash;one of them was, to see your
      invaluable business man, Gleeson, who, from some caprice or other about a
      higher rate of interest, has withdrawn my sister&rsquo;s fortune from the funds
      to invest it in some confounded mortgage. I suppose it&rsquo;s all right, and
      judicious to boot; but Maria, like every other Daly I ever heard of, has a
      will of her own, and has commissioned me to have the money restored to its
      former destination. I verily believe, Darcy, the most troublesome animal
      on the face of the globe is an old maid with a small funded capital. At
      one moment deploring the low rate of interest and dying for a more
      profitable use of the money; at another, decrying all deposit save the
      Bank, she inveighs against public theft and private credit, and takes off
      three-and-a-half per cent of her happiness in pure fretting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she quite well?&rdquo; said the Knight, in an accent which a more shrewd
      observer than Daly might have perceived was marked by some agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew her better; as fearless as we both remember her at sixteen;
      and, save those strange intervals of depression she has labored under all
      through her life, the same gay-hearted spirit she was when the flattered
      heiress and beauty long, long years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Knight heaved a sigh. It might have been for the years thus passed,
      the pleasant days of early youth and manhood so suddenly called up before
      him; it might have been that other and more tender memories were crowding
      on his mind; but he turned away, and leaned on the chimney-piece, lost in
      deep thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor girl,&rdquo; said Daly, &ldquo;there is no question of it, Darcy, but she must
      have formed some unfortunate attachment; she had pride enough always to
      rescue her from the dangers of an unsuitable marriage, but her heart, I
      feel convinced, was touched, and yet I never could find a clew to it. I
      suspected something of the kind when she refused Donington,&mdash;a
      handsome fellow, and an old title. I pressed her myself on the subject,&mdash;it
      was the only time I did so,&mdash;and I guessed at once, from a chance
      phrase she dropped, that there had been an old attachment somewhere. Well,
      well, what a lesson might be read from both our fortunes! The beauty&mdash;and
      you remember how handsome she was&mdash;the beauty with a splendid
      fortune, a reduced maiden lady; and myself&rdquo;&mdash;he heaved a heavy sigh,
      and, with clasped hands, sat back in the chair, as he added&mdash;&ldquo;the
      shattered wreck of every hope I once set out with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two old men&rsquo;s eyes met, and, although undesignedly, exchanged looks of
      deepest, most affectionate interest. Daly was the first to rally from his
      brief access of despondency, and he did so with the physical effort he
      would have used to shake a load from his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Darcy, let us be up and stirring; there&rsquo;s a meeting at Barrington&rsquo;s
      at two: we must not fail to be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to see Gleeson in the mean while,&rdquo; said the Knight; &ldquo;I am uneasy
      to learn what has been done with Hickman, and what day I can leave town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send Sandy out with a note, and tell him to come to dinner here at six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed; nothing could be better; we can talk over our business matters
      comfortably, and be down at the House by nine or ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The note was soon written, and Sandy despatched, with orders to wait for
      Gleeson&rsquo;s return, in case he should be absent when he arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day for the evening of which was fixed the second reading of the Bill
      of Union, was a busy one in Dublin. Accounts the most opposite and
      contradictory were everywhere in circulation: some asserting that the
      Ministerial majority was certain; others, equally positive, alleging that
      many of their supposed supporters had lapsed in their allegiance, and that
      the most enormous offers had been made, without success, to parties
      hitherto believed amongst the ranks of the Government. The streets were
      crowded, not by persons engaged in the usual affairs of trade and traffic,
      but by groups and knots talking eagerly over the coming event, and
      discussing every rumor that chance or scandal suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Various meetings were held in different parts of the town: at some, the
      Government party were canvassing the modes of reaching the House in
      safety, and how best they might escape the violence of the mob; at others,
      the Opposition deliberated on the prospects before them, and by what
      stratagems the debate might be prolonged till the period when, the Wicklow
      election over, Mr. Grattan might be expected to take his seat in the
      House, since, by a trick of &ldquo;the Castle party,&rdquo; the writ had been delayed
      to that very morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Con Heffernan&rsquo;s carriage was seen everywhere, and some avowed that at five
      o&rsquo;clock he was driving with the third pair of posters he had that day
      employed. Bagenal Daly was also a conspicuous character &ldquo;on town;&rdquo; on foot
      and alone, he was at once recognized by the mob, who cheered him as an old
      but long-lost-sight-of acquaintance. The densest crowd made way for him as
      he came, and every mark of respect was shown him by those who set a higher
      price on his eccentricity and daring than even upon his patriotism; and a
      murmuring commentary on his character followed him as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my conscience! it &lsquo;s well for them they have n&rsquo;t to fight for the
      Union, or they would n&rsquo;t like old Bagenal Daly agin them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks as fresh and bould as ever he did,&rdquo; said another; &ldquo;sorra a day
      oulder than he was twenty-eight years ago, when I seen him tried for his
      life at Newgate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was you there, Mickey?&rdquo; cried two or three in a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix was I, as near as I am to you. &lsquo;Twas a coal-heaver he kilt, a chap
      that was called Big Sam; and they say he was bribed by some of the
      gentlemen at Daly&rsquo;s Club House to come up to Bagenal Daly in the street
      and insult him about the beard he wears on his upper lip, and sure enough
      so he did,&mdash;it was Ash Wednesday mor by token,&mdash;and Sam had a
      smut on his face just to imitat(e) Mr. Daly&rsquo;s. &lsquo;We are a purty pair, ain&rsquo;t
      we?&rsquo; says Sam, grinning at him, when they met on Essex Bridge. And wid
      that he slips his arm inside Mr. Daly&rsquo;s to hook wid his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To walk beside him, is&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so, divil a less. &lsquo;Come round to the other side of me,&rsquo; says Daly,
      &lsquo;for I want to step into Kertland&rsquo;s shop.&rsquo; And in they went together, and
      Daly asks for a pound of strong white soap, and pays down
      one-and-eight-pence for it, and out they comes again quite friendly as
      before. &lsquo;Where to now?&rsquo; says Sam, for he held a grip of him like a
      bailiff. &lsquo;Across the bridge,&rsquo; says Daly; and so it was. When they reached
      the middle arch of the bridge, Daly made a spring and got himself free,
      and then, stooping down, caught Sam by the knees, and before you could say
      &lsquo;Jack Robinson,&rsquo; hurled him over the battlements into the Liffey. &lsquo;You can
      wash your face now,&rsquo; says he, and he threw the soap after him; divil a
      word more he said, but walked on, as cool as you saw him there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Sam?&rdquo; said several together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam was drowned; there came a fresh in the river, and they took him up
      beyond the North Wall&mdash;a corpse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Millia murther! what did Daly do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took his trial for it, and sorra excuse he gave one way or other, but
      that he &lsquo;did n&rsquo;t know the blackguard couldn&rsquo;t swim.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they let him off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him off? Arrah, is it hang a gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True for you,&rdquo; chimed in the bystanders; &ldquo;them that makes the laws knows
      better than that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was one of the narratives his reappearance in Dublin again brought
      up; and, singular enough, by the respect shown him by the mob, derived
      much of its source in that same feeling of awe and dread they manifested
      towards one they believed privileged to do whatever he pleased. Alas for
      human nature! the qualities which find favor with the multitude are never
      the finer and better traits of the heart, but rather the sterner features
      that emanate from a strong will and firm purpose.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      If the voices of the closely compacted mass which filled the streets and
      avenues of Dublin on that day could have been taken, it would have been
      found that Bagenal Daly had an overwhelming majority; while, on a converse
      scrutiny, it would appear that not a gentleman in Ireland entertained for
      that mob sentiments of such thorough contempt as he did. Nor was the
      sentiment concealed by him. The crowd which, growing as it went, followed
      him from place to place throughout the city, would break forth at
      intervals into some spontaneous shout of admiration, and a cheer for
      Bagenal Daly, commanded by some deep throat, would be answered in a
      deafening roar of voices. Then would Daly turn, and, as the moving mass
      fell back, scowl upon their unwashed faces with such a look of scorn that
      even they half felt the insult. In such wise was his progress through the
      streets of Dublin, now moving slowly onward, now turning to confront the
      mob that in slavish adulation still tracked his steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at a moment like this, when, standing at bay, he scowled upon the
      dense throng, Heffernan&rsquo;s carriage drove slowly past, and Con, leaning
      from the window, called out in a dramatic tone, &ldquo;Thy friends, Siccius
      Dentatus, thy friends!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daly started, and as his cheek reddened, answered, &ldquo;Ay, and by my soul,
      for the turning of a straw, I &lsquo;d make them your enemies.&rdquo; And as if
      responsive to the threat, a groan for &ldquo;the Castle hack, three groans for
      Con Heffernan,&rdquo; were shouted out in tones that shook the street. For a
      second or two Daly&rsquo;s face brightened, and his eyes sparkled with the fire
      of enterprise, and he gazed on the countless mass with a look of
      indecision; but, suddenly folding his arms, he dropped his head, and
      muttered, &ldquo;No, no, it would n&rsquo;t do; robbery and pillage would be the whole
      of it;&rdquo; and, without raising his eyes again, walked slowly homewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours wore on, and six o&rsquo;clock came, but no sign of Gleeson, nor had
      Sandy returned with any answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet I am positive he is not from home,&rdquo; said Darcy. &ldquo;He pledged
      himself not to leave this until the whole business was completed. Honest
      Tom Gleeson is a man to keep to the strictest letter of his word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;d not think that less likely,&rdquo; said Daly, sententiously, &ldquo;if the world
      had spared him the epithet. I hate the cant of calling a man by some title
      that should be common to all men,&mdash;at least, to all gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot agree with you,&rdquo; said Darcy. &ldquo;I deem it a proud thing for any
      one so to have impressed his reputation for honorable dealing on society
      that the very mention of his name suggests his character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I am soured by what we have seen around us,&rdquo; said Daly; &ldquo;but the
      mention of every virtue latterly has been generally followed by the
      announcement of the purchase of its possessor. I never hear of a good
      character that I don&rsquo;t think it is a puffing advertisement of &lsquo;a
      high-priced article to be had cheap for cash.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll think better of the world after a glass or two of Madeira,&rdquo; said
      Darcy, laughing; &ldquo;and rather than hear you inveigh against mankind, I&rsquo;ll
      let Gleeson eat his soup cold.&rdquo; And, so saying, he rang the bell and
      ordered dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two friends dined pleasantly, and although, from time to time, some
      stray thought of Gleeson&rsquo;s absence would obtrude, they chatted away
      agreeably till past nine o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to suspect that Sandy may have met some acquaintance, and
      lingered to pledge &lsquo;old times&rsquo; with him,&rdquo; said Darcy, looking at his
      watch. &ldquo;It is now nearly twenty minutes past nine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stake my life on it, Sandy is true to his mission. He&rsquo;d not turn
      from the duty intrusted to him to hobnob with a Prince of the Blood. Here
      he comes, however; there was a knock at the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But no; it was a few hurried lines in pencil from the House, begging of
      them to come up at once, as the Ministerial party was mustering in
      strength, and the Opposition benches filling but slowly. While
      deliberating on what course to take, a second summons came from one of the
      leading men of the party. It was brief, but significant: &ldquo;Come up quickly.
      They are evidently pushed hard. Toler has sent a message to O&rsquo;Donnell, and
      they are gone out, and Harvey says Castlereagh has six of his fellows
      ready to provoke us.&mdash;W. T.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That looks like business, Darcy,&rdquo; cried Daly, in a transport of delight.
      &ldquo;Let us lose no time; there&rsquo;s no knowing how soon so much good valor may
      ooze out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Gleeson&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he comes, let him follow us to the House. We can walk; there&rsquo;s no use
      waiting for the carriage.&rdquo; Then added, in a mutter to himself, &ldquo;I &lsquo;d give
      a hundred down to have a shot at the Attorney-General. There, that &lsquo;s
      Sandy&rsquo;s voice in the hall;&rdquo; and at the same instant the trusty servant
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have you seen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sirs, he&rsquo;s no at hame, that&rsquo;s clear. When I asked for him, they told
      me he was in bed, asleep, for that he was just arrived after a long
      journey; and so I waited a bit, and gaed out for a walk into the
      shrubberies, where I could have a look at his chamber windows, and sure
      enough they were a&rsquo; closed. I waited a while longer, but he was still
      sleeping, and they dared na wake him; and so it came to nigh five o&rsquo;clock,
      and then I was fain to send up the bit letter by the flunkie, and ask for
      the answer; but none came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you say that the letter was from me?&rdquo; said the Knight, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na, sir; but I tauld them what most people mind as well, that Mister
      Bagenal Daly sent me. It&rsquo;s a name few folk are fond to trifle wi&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Sandy,&rdquo; said Daly, &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, sir, I sat down on the stair at the foot of the big clock, and said
      to mysel, &lsquo;I &lsquo;ll gie ye ten minutes mair, but not a second after.&rsquo; And
      sure enough ye might hear every tick of her through the house, a&rsquo; was so
      still and silent. Short as the time was, I thought it wad never gae past,
      for I did no tak my eyes aff o&rsquo; her face. When the ten minutes was up, I
      stole gently up the stair, and opened the door. A was dark inside, so I
      opened the window, and there was the bed&mdash;empty; nobody had lain in
      it syne it was made. There was a bit ashes in the grate, and some burned
      paper on the hearth, but na other sign that onybody was there at a&rsquo;, sae I
      crept back again, and met the flunkie as he was coming up, for he had just
      missed me, and was in a real fright where I was gone to. I saw by his face
      that he was found out, and so I laid my hand on his shoulder, and said,
      &lsquo;Ye ha tauld me ane lee; ye maun tak care no to tell me anither. Where is
      yer maister?&rsquo; Then came out the truth. Mr. Gleeson was gane awa to
      England. He sailed for Liverpool in the &lsquo;Shamrock.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; said Darcy. &ldquo;He could not be away from Dublin at this
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s even sae,&rdquo; replied Sandy, gravely; &ldquo;for when I heard a&rsquo; that I could
      from the flunkie, I put him into the library, and locked the door on him,
      and then went round to the stable-yard, where the coachman was sitting in
      the harness-room, smoking. &lsquo;And so he&rsquo;s off to England,&rsquo; said I to him, as
      if I kenned it a&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Just sae,&rsquo; said he, wi&rsquo; the pipe in his mouth. &ldquo;&lsquo;And he&rsquo;s nae to be back
      for some time,&rsquo; said I, speerin&rsquo; at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;On Friday,&rsquo; said he; and he smoked away, and never a word mair could I
      get out o&rsquo; him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Sandy,&rdquo; said the Knight, laughing, &ldquo;they&rsquo;d make you a prefect of
      police if they had you in France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dinna ken, sir,&rdquo; said Sandy, not exactly appreciating what the nature
      of the appointment might portend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only hope Gleeson may not hear of the perquisition on his return,&rdquo; said
      the Knight, in a whisper to Daly. &ldquo;Our friend Sandy pushes his spirit of
      inquiry somewhat far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; said Daly, thoughtfully; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a shrewd fellow, and
      rarely makes a mistake of that kind. But come, let us lose no more time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I half suspect the reason of this mystery about Gleeson,&rdquo; said the
      Knight, who stood musing deeply on the event; &ldquo;a few words Drogheda let
      fall yesterday, going in to dinner,&mdash;some unfortunate speculation in
      South America: this may require his keeping out of the way for a little
      time. But why not say so, manfully?&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m ready to assist
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, Darcy, we must walk; they say no carriage can get through the
      mob.&rdquo; And, with these words, he took the Knight&rsquo;s arm and sallied forth,
      while Sandy followed, conveying a large cloth cloak over his arm, which
      only partially concealed an ominous-looking box of mahogany wood, strapped
      with brass.
    </p>
    <p>
      A crowd awaited them as they reached the street, by which they were
      escorted through the denser mass that thronged the great thoroughfare, the
      mere mention of their names being sufficient to force a passage even where
      the mob stood thickest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The space in front of the Parliament House and before the College was
      filled with soldiers; while patrols of cavalry traversed every avenue
      leading to it, for information had reached the Government that violence
      might be apprehended from a mob whose force and numbers were alluded to by
      members within the House in terms meant to intimidate, while the presence
      of the soldiery was retorted by the Opposition as a measure of tyranny and
      oppression of the Castle party. Brushing somewhat roughly through the
      armed line, Daly, with the Knight beside him, entered the space, and was
      passing onward, when a bustle and a confused uproar behind him arrested
      his steps. Believing that it might be to Sandy&rsquo;s progress some objection
      was offered, Daly wheeled round, when he saw two policemen in the act of
      dragging away a boy, whose loud cries for help from the mob were
      incessant, while he mingled the name of Mr. Daly through his entreaties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Daly. &ldquo;Does the fellow want me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0009" id="linkimage-0009">
      <!-- IMG --></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/234.jpg" width="100%" alt="234 " />
    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind him,&rdquo; said Darcy; &ldquo;the boy has caught up your name, and that&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the urchin struggled and kicked with all his might; and, although
      overpowered by superior strength, gave battle to the last, screaming at
      the top of his voice, &ldquo;One word with Mr. Daly,&mdash;just one word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bagenal Daly turned back, and, approaching the scene of contest, said,
      &ldquo;Have you anything to say to me? I am Mr. Daly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they &lsquo;d let me go my hands, I &lsquo;ve something to give you,&rdquo; said the
      boy, who, although sorely bruised and beaten, seemed to care less for his
      own troubles than for the object of his enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a word from Daly, the policemen relinquished their hold, and stood
      guard on either side, while the boy, giving himself a shake, leered up in
      Daly&rsquo;s face with an expression he could not fail to recognize.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a way to treat a young gentleman at home for the Christmas
      holidays!&rdquo; said the imp, with a compassionate glance at his torn and
      tattered garments, while the words and the tone they were uttered in sent
      a shout of laughter through the mob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Jemmy!&rdquo; said Daly, stooping down and accosting him in a whisper,
      for it was no other than that reputable youth himself, &ldquo;you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so, sir. Ain&rsquo;t I in a nice way to appear at the Privy Council?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The police were growing impatient at the continued insolence of the
      fellow, and were about to lay hold on him once more, when Daly interposed,
      and said, in a still lower voice, &ldquo;Have you anything to tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ve a bit of paper for you somewhere, from one you know, if them
      blackguards the &lsquo;polis&rsquo; has not made me lose it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quick, then,&rdquo; said Daly, &ldquo;and see after it.&rdquo; For Darcy was chafed at a
      delay he could not see any reason for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said the imp, taking a piece of dirty and crumpled paper
      from the lining of his hat; &ldquo;there, you have it now safe and sure. Give my
      best respects to Alderman Darby,&rdquo; added he to the police; &ldquo;say I was too
      hurried to call;&rdquo; and with that he dived between the legs of one of them,
      dashed through the line of soldiers, and was speedily concealed among the
      dense crowd outside, where shouts of approving laughter welcomed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rendezvous or a challenge, Bagenal,&mdash;which?&rdquo; said the Knight,
      laughing, as Daly stood endeavoring, by the light of a lamp in the
      corridor, to decipher the torn scrawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other made no reply, but, holding the paper close to his eyes, stood
      silent and motionless. At last an expression of impatient anger burst from
      him: &ldquo;That imp of h&mdash;ll has almost effaced the words,&mdash;I cannot
      make them out!&rdquo; Then he added, in a low muttering, &ldquo;I trust in Heaven I
      have not read them aright. Come here, Darcy.&rdquo; And, so saying, he grasped
      the Knight&rsquo;s hand, and led him along to one of the many small chambers
      used as offices of the House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! they&rsquo;re looking anxiously out for you, sir,&rdquo; said a young man who
      stood with his back to the fire, reading a paper. &ldquo;Mr. Ponsonby has just
      been here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave us together here for a few minutes,&rdquo; said Daly, &ldquo;and let there be
      no interruption.&rdquo; And as he spoke, he motioned to the door with a gesture
      there was no mistaking. The clerk left the room, and they were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maurice Darcy,&rdquo; said Daly, as he turned the key in the lock, &ldquo;you have a
      stout heart and a courage I never saw fail, and you need both at this
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Bagenal?&rdquo; gasped the Knight, as a most deadly pallor covered
      his face. &ldquo;Is my wife&mdash;are my children&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; be calm, Darcy, they are all well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, then,&rdquo; cried he, with a firmer voice; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll listen to you
      patiently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read that,&rdquo; said Daly, as he held the paper near the candle; and the
      Knight read aloud: &ldquo;&lsquo;Honored Sir,&mdash;I saw the other night you were
      troubled when I spoke of Gleeson, and I take the occasion of&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
       &ldquo;&lsquo;warning you,&rsquo; I think the words are,&rdquo; broke in Daly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is:&mdash;&lsquo;warning you honest Tom is away to America!&rsquo;&rdquo; The paper
      fell from Darcy&rsquo;s hand, and he staggered back into a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With they say above a hundred thousand pounds, Darcy,&rdquo; continued Daly,
      taking up the fragment. &ldquo;If the news be true&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If so, I&rsquo;m ruined; he received the whole loan on Saturday last,&mdash;he
      could not delay Hickman&rsquo;s payment beyond Wednesday without suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I see it all, and the American packet does not sail till to-morrow
      morning from Liverpool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it may all be false,&rdquo; said Darcy. &ldquo;Who writes you this story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is signed &lsquo;F.,&rsquo; and Freney is the man; I know the fellow that brought
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll not believe a word of it, Bagenal,&rdquo; said the Knight, impetuously.
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll not credit the calumny of a highwayman against the honor of one I
      have known and respected for years. It is false, depend upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet how it tallies with Sandy&rsquo;s tidings; there is something in it. Hush!
      Darcy, don&rsquo;t speak; there is some one passing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sounds of feet and voices were heard at the same instant without, and
      among them the clear, distinctive accents of Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if the news had come a little earlier, Lord Castlereagh,
      would have found some of our patriots less stern in virtue. Gleeson will
      have carried away half a province with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; whispered Daly, &ldquo;you heard that,&mdash;the news is about
      already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Darcy was now totally overcome, and, with his head resting on the
      table, neither spoke nor stirred. &ldquo;Bagenal,&rdquo; said he, at length, but in a
      voice faint as a whisper, &ldquo;I am too ill to face the House; let us turn
      homewards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll see for a carriage,&rdquo; said Daly, who issued forth to take the first
      he could find.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Hamilton,&rdquo; cried a member, as he alighted from his chariot,
      &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the Knight of Gwynne and Bagenal Daly in Castlereagh&rsquo;s carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daly said he could drive a coach-and-six through the Bill!&rdquo; replied the
      other; &ldquo;perhaps he&rsquo;s gone to practise with a pair first.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. THE ADJOURNED DEBATE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Although the debate had commenced at seven o&rsquo;clock, none of the great
      speakers on either side arose before eleven. Some fierce skirmishes had,
      indeed, occurred; personalities and sarcasms the most cutting had been
      interchanged with a freedom that showed that if shame were in a great
      measure departed, personal daring and intrepidity were qualities still in
      repute. The Ministerial party, no longer timid or wavering, took no pains
      to conceal their sense of coming victory, and even Lord Castlereagh,
      usually so guarded on every outward observance, entered the House and took
      his seat with a smile of conscious triumph that did not escape observation
      from either friends or opponents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tactics of the Treasury benches, too, seemed changed: not waiting, as
      hitherto, to receive and repel the attack of the Opposition, they now
      became themselves the assailants, and evinced, by the readiness and
      frequency of their assaults, the perfect organization they had attained.
      The Opposition members, who opened the debate, were suffered to proceed
      without any attempt at reply, an ironical cheer, a well-put question, some
      home-thrust as to former opinions, alone breaking the thread of an
      argument which, even from its monotony, was becoming less effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Henry Parnell, the late Chancellor of the Exchequer, and who had been
      dismissed from office for his opinions on the Union, was the first
      speaker; with a moderation, in part the result of his former position with
      regard to those who had been his colleagues, he limited himself to a
      strict examination of the measure in its bearings and consequences, and
      never, even for a moment, digressed into anything like reflection on the
      motives of its advocates. His speech was able and argumentative, but
      evidently unsatisfactory to his party, who seemed impatient and uneasy
      till he concluded, and hailed Ponsonby, who rose after him, with cheers
      that showed their expectations were now, at least, more likely to be
      realized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the occasion alone was the cause, or that catching the excitement
      of his supporters, Ponsonby deviated from the usually calm and temperate
      character he was accustomed to assume in the House, and became warm and
      impassioned. Disdaining to examine the relative merits or demerits of the
      proposed Bill, he boldly pronounced Parliament incompetent to decide it,
      and concluded by declaring that, if carried, the measure might endanger
      not only the ties of amity between the two nations, but dissolve those of
      allegiance also. A loud burst of mingled indignation and irony broke from
      the Treasury benches at this daring flight, when the speaker, at once
      collecting himself, turned the whole force of his attack on the Secretary.
      With slow and measured intonation, he depicted the various stages of his
      political career, recalling to memory the liberal pledges he had once
      contracted, and the various shades of defection by which he had at last
      reached the position in which he could &ldquo;betray Ireland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      None were prepared for the degree of eloquent power Ponsonby displayed on
      this occasion; and the effect of such a speech from one habitually calm,
      even to coldness, was overwhelming. It was not Lord Castlereagh&rsquo;s
      intention to have spoken at this early hour of the debate; but,
      apologizing for occupying the time of the House by a personality, he
      arose, not self-possessed and at ease, but flushed and excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without adverting for a second to the measure in debate, he launched forth
      into a most violent invective on his adversary. With a vehement passion
      that only his nearest friends knew him to possess, he exposed every act of
      his political life; taunted him with holding opinions liberal enough to be
      a patriot, but sufficiently plastic to be marketable; he accused his very
      calmness as being a hypocritical affectation of fairness, while in reality
      it was but the tacit admission of his readiness to be bought; and at
      length pushed his violent sarcasm so far that a loud cry of &ldquo;Order!&rdquo; burst
      forth from the Opposition, while cheers of defiance were heard along the
      densely crowded ranks of the Ministerial party.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this moment the discussion assumed a most bitter character;
      assertions and denials, uttered in language the most insulting, were heard
      at every moment, and no speaker could proceed without some interruption
      which demanded several minutes to subdue. More than one member was seen to
      cross the floor and interchange a few words with an adversary, the import
      of which, as he returned to his place, no physiognomist need have doubted.
      It was not debate or discussion, it was the vehement outpouring of
      personal and political hatred, by men whose passions were no longer
      restrainable, and many of whom saw in this the last occasion of their ever
      being able to confront their enemies. Language that could not be uttered
      with impunity elsewhere, was heard at every moment; open declarations were
      made that, the Bill once carried, allegiance and loyalty were dissolved;
      and Sir Neil O&rsquo;Donnell went so far as to say that he regarded the measure
      as an act of treason, and would place himself at the head of his regiment
      to oppose and annul it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in a momentary pause of this bitter conflict that rumor announced
      the arrival of the Knight of Gwynne and Bagenal Daly at the House. Never
      were reinforcements more gladly hailed by a weakened and disabled army;
      cheers of triumphant delight broke from the Opposition benches, answered
      by others, not less loud and taunting, from the Ministerial side, and
      every eye was turned eagerly towards the door by which they were expected
      to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      To such a pitch of violence had partisanship carried the members on both
      sides, expressions of open defiance and insult were exchanged in the midst
      of this scene of tumult, nor was the authority of the Speaker able to
      restore order for several minutes; when at last the doors were thrown
      open, and Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly entered, and walked up the body of the House.
      Shouts of loud laughter now resounded from either side; such an apparition
      at the moment was the most ludicrous contrast to that expected, and a
      boisterous gayety succeeded to the late scene of acrimony and
      intemperance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The individual himself seemed somewhat puzzled at these unlooked-for marks
      of public notice, and stared around him in astonishment, till his eyes
      rested on the spot where Lord Castlereagh sat whispering with Mr. Corry.
      Brief as was the glance, it seemed to have conveyed some momentous
      intelligence to the gazer, for he became at first scarlet, and then pale
      as death; he looked again, but the Secretary had turned his head away, and
      Corry was coolly unfolding the plaits of a white cambric handkerchief, and
      apparently only occupied with that object. At this moment Hickman was
      standing with one foot upon the steps which led towards the Treasury
      benches: he wheeled abruptly round, and walked over to the other side of
      the House, where he sat down between Egan and Ponsonby.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cheers of the Opposition now burst forth anew, and with a deafening
      clamor, while from back and cross benches, and everywhere within reach,
      hands were eagerly stretched forth to grasp O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s. Never was support
      less expected, never an alliance less speculated on, and the cries of
      exultation were almost maddening. How long the scene of tumultuous
      excitement might have lasted, it is difficult to say, when Lord
      Castlereagh rose, with a calm dignity of manner that never in the most
      trying moments forsook him. &ldquo;He begged to remind the gentlemen opposite
      that if these triumphant expressions were not indecorous, they were at
      least premature; that the momentous occasion on which they were met
      demanded all the temperate and calm consideration which they could bestow
      upon it; that the time for the adoption of any course would not be
      distant, and would sufficiently show to which side, with most propriety,
      the expression of triumph belonged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hint was significant; the foreshadowed victory was too plainly and too
      palpably predicted to admit of a doubt, and a chilling silence succeeded
      to the former uproar. The individual whose address this long scene of
      tumult had interrupted was now suffered to proceed. He was a law-serjeant,
      a man of inferior capacity and small professional repute, whose advocacy
      of the Government plan had raised him to an unbecoming and dangerous
      eminence at the Bar. Without the slightest pretensions as a speaker, or
      one quality that should adorn a statesman, he possessed other gifts
      scarcely less valuable at that day: he was a ready pistol; he came of a
      fighting family, not one of whom did not owe some advancement in life to a
      cool hand and a steady eye; and he occupied his place in the Ministerial
      van by virtue of this signal accomplishment. As incapable of feeling the
      keen sarcasm of his opponents as he was of using a similar weapon, he was
      yet irascible from temperament, and overbearing in manner, and was used by
      his party as men employ a fire-ship,&mdash;with a strong conviction that
      it may damage more than the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cover the deficiencies of his oratory, as well as to add poignancy to
      his personalities, it was the invariable custom of his friends to cheer
      him vociferously at the end of every sentence which contained anything
      like attack on the Opposition; and to this species of backing he was
      indebted for the courage that made him assail men incomparably above him
      in every quality of intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Plunkett was now the object of his invective, nor was the boldness of
      such a daring its least recommendation. Few of the Government side of the
      House would have adventured to cross weapons with this master of sarcasm
      and irony; none but the Serjeant Nickolls could have done so without a
      strong fear of consequences. He, however, was unconcerned for the result
      as it affected himself personally; and as for the withering storm that
      awaited him, the triple hide of his native dulness was an armor of proof
      that nothing could penetrate. From Plunkett he passed on to Bushe, from
      Bushe to Grattan; no game flew too high for his shafts, nor was any
      invective coarse enough to level at the great leaders of the Opposition.
      If the overbearing insolence of his harangue delighted his own party, it
      called down peals of laughter from his opponents, who cheered every
      figurative absurdity and every illogical conclusion with shouts of
      ironical admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Castlereagh saw the mischief, and would gladly have cut short the
      oration; but the speaker was revelling in an imaginary victory, and would
      listen to no suggestions whatever. Passing from the great names of the
      Irish party, he launched forth in terms of insult towards the county
      members, whom he openly accused of holding their opinions under a mistaken
      hope that they were a marketable commodity, and that as some stanch
      adherents of the Crown had reaped the honors due to &ldquo;their loyalty,&rdquo; these
      quasi-patriots were only waiting for their price. The allusion was so
      palpable that every eye was turned to where Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly sat, and
      whose confusion was now overwhelming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; continued the speaker, now carried beyond all self-restraint by the
      evident sensation he had caused, &ldquo;there are gentlemen opposite whose
      confessions would reveal much of this kind of independence. I have my eye
      on some of them,&mdash;men who will be Patriots if they cannot be Peers,
      ready to put on the cap of liberty for the Mob if they cannot get the
      coronet from the Crown. Many, too, are absent from this debate: they stand
      out, perhaps, for high terms; they have got Peerages for their wives, and
      now, like a hackney-coachman, not content with their fare, they want
      &lsquo;something for themselves.&rsquo; I heard of two such a while ago; they even
      came as far as the lobby of this House, where they halted and hesitated: a
      mitre or a regiment, a blue ribbon or a red one, would have turned the
      scale, perhaps. Why are they not here now? I ask, what has become of
      them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name! name!&rdquo; screamed the Opposition, in a torrent of mad excitement,
      while the Government party, outrageous at the blundering folly of the
      whole harangue, endeavored to pull the speaker back into his seat. Never
      was such a scene: one party lashed to madness by suspected treachery and
      open insult; the other indignant at the stupidity of a man who, in his
      attempts at attack, had raked up every calumny against his own friends.
      Already, more than one hand was laid on his arms to press him down into
      his seat, when he, with the obstinacy of thorough dullness, shook himself
      free, and called out, &ldquo;I &lsquo;m ready to name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the cries of &ldquo;Name!&rdquo; were shouted, mingled with no less vociferous
      cries of &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; and the struggle now had every appearance of a personal
      one, when the Speaker, calling to order, asked if it was the sense of the
      House that the Serjeant should gives the names he alluded to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll soon cut the matter short,&rdquo; called out the Serjeant, in a voice
      that resounded through every corridor of the House. &ldquo;I mean the Knight of
      Gwynne and Bagenal Daly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cry of &ldquo;Order! order!&rdquo; now arose from all parts of the House, the direct
      mention of any member by name being a liberty unprecedented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg to correct myself,&rdquo; said the Serjeant. &ldquo;I should have said the
      honorable members for Mayo and Old Castle. I ask again, why are they not
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better you had never put the question,&rdquo; said a deep, low voice from
      beneath the gallery; and at the same instant Bagenal Daly advanced along
      one of the passages, and took his place at the table directly in front of
      the Serjeant. A tremendous cheer now broke from the Opposition benches,
      which the Ministerial party in vain essayed to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perceive, sir,&rdquo; said the Serjeant, with an effort to resume his former
      ease,&mdash;&ldquo;I perceive I have succeeded in conjuring up one at least of
      these truant spirits, and I cannot do better than leave him to make his
      explanations to the House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this lame, disjointed conclusion the learned Serjeant sat down; and
      although the greatest exertions were made by his friends to cover this
      palpable failure, the cries of derision drowned all other sounds, and
      before they were silenced, a shout of &ldquo;Daly! Daly!&mdash;Bagenal Daly!&rdquo;
       resounded through the building.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daly arose slowly, and saluted the Speaker with a most deferential
      courtesy. It was several minutes before the tumult had sufficiently
      subsided to make his words audible; but when silence prevailed, he was
      heard to regret, in terms of unaffected ease, that any circumstance might
      occur which should occupy the time of the House by observations from one
      so rude and unlettered as himself, nor would he now venture on the
      trespass, were the occasion merely a personal one. From this he proceeded
      to state that great emergencies were always occurring, in which even the
      humblest opinions should be made known as evidencing the probable
      impressions upon others as lowly circumstanced as he who now addressed
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such is the present one,&rdquo; said he, raising his voice, and looking around
      him with a glance of bold defiance. &ldquo;You are about to take away the right
      of self-government from a nation, and every man in the land, not only such
      as sit here, sir, but every man to whose future ambition a seat in this
      House may form a goal, every man has a deep interest in your proceedings.
      It is a grave and weighty question, whose conditions impose the conviction
      that we are unfit to legislate for ourselves,&mdash;that we are too weak,
      or too venal, or too ignorant, or too dishonest. To that conclusion you
      must come, or no other. Absence from Ireland must suggest enlightenment on
      her interests; distance must lend knowledge as well as enchantment, or an
      English Parliament cannot be better than our own. I have listened
      attentively, but unconvinced, to all arguments on this head; I have heard
      over and over again the long catalogue of benefits to accrue to this
      country when the power of realizing them herself has been wrested from
      her, and I have thought of Lear and his daughters! It would seem to me,
      however, that the social welfare and the commercial prosperity of a people
      are themes too vulgar for the high consideration of our times. The real
      question at issue is not whether a Parliament should or should not
      continue to sit here, but what shall I, and others like me, benefit by
      voting it away forever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order! order!&rdquo; called out several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Daly resumed: &ldquo;I ask pardon. It is more parliamentary to put the case
      differently, and I shall, under correction, do so. Well, sir, we may
      benefit largely. I trust I am not disorderly in saying that peerages,
      bishoprics, regiments, frigates, commissionerships, and Heaven knows what
      more, will reward us when our utility to the State has met the approval of
      an Imperial Parliament. I can well credit every promise of such gratitude,
      and have only to ask in turn, Are these the arguments that should sway us
      now? Is it because we are bungling legislators that they wish for us in
      London?&mdash;is it because we are venal they seek our company, because we
      are inefficient they ask for our cooperation? Are they so supremely
      right-minded, honorable, and far-seeing that they need the alloy of our
      dulness to make them mortal? And suppose such the case, will it be
      gratifying to us to become the helots to this people? Will our national
      pride be flattered because our eloquence is sneered at, our law derided,
      our political knowledge a scoff, and our very accent a joke? Do not tell
      me such things are unlikely; we are far weaker on the point than we like
      to confess. For myself, I can imagine the sense of shame&mdash;of deep,
      heartfelt, abasing shame&mdash;I should feel at seeing some of those I see
      here rise in a British House of Commons to address that body, while the
      rumor should run, &lsquo;He is the member for Meath or for Wicklow.&rsquo; I can
      picture to myself such a man: a man of low origin and mean capacity; a man
      who carves his path in life less from his own keen abilities than that
      others shrink from his contact, and leave him unopposed in every struggle;
      a pettifogger at the Bar; a place-hunter at the Parliament; half beggar,
      half bravo, with a petition for the Minister, and a pistol for the
      Opposition. Imagine a man like this, and reflect upon the feeling of every
      gentleman at hearing the rumor announce, &lsquo;Ay, that&rsquo;s a learned Serjeant, a
      leader at the Bar of Ireland.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last words were delivered in a tone of direct personality, as, turning
      towards where Nickolls sat, Daly threw at him a look of defiance. The
      whole House arose as if one man, with cheers and counter-cheers, and loud
      yells of insult, mingled with cries of &ldquo;Order!&rdquo; Nor was it till after a
      long and desperate wordy altercation that the clamor was subdued, and
      decorum at length restored. Then it was remarked that Nickolls had left
      the House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Speaker immediately ordered the Serjeant of the House to place Daly
      under arrest,&mdash;a measure which, however dictated by propriety, seemed
      to call forth a burst of indignation from the Opposition benches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, sir,&rdquo; said Daly, rising with an air of most admirably feigned
      humility,&mdash;&ldquo;I hope, sir, you will not execute this threat,&mdash;the
      inconvenience to me will be very great: I was about to pair off with the
      honorable and learned member for Newry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mention of the town for which the Serjeant sat in Parliament renewed
      the laughter which now prevailed on both sides of the House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot understand the mirth of the gentlemen opposite,&rdquo; said Daly, with
      affected simplicity, &ldquo;without it be from their astonishment that the
      Government can spare so able and so eloquent an advocate as the honorable
      and learned gentleman; but let them reassure themselves and look around,
      and, believe me, they&rsquo;ll find the Treasury benches filled by gentlemen as
      like him as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Speaker reissued the order to the Serjeant-at-Arms, and Daly now came
      forward to the table and begged in all form to know the reason of such
      severity. &ldquo;If, sir,&rdquo; said he, in conclusion,&mdash;&ldquo;if I could believe it
      possible that you anticipate any personal collision between myself and any
      member of this House, I have only to say that I am bound over in the sum
      of two thousand pounds to keep the peace within the limits of this
      kingdom. I take out a license at two pounds fifteen to kill game, it is
      true; but I &lsquo;d not pay sixpence for the privilege to shoot a lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fact of the heavy recognizances to which Daly alluded was at once
      confirmed by several members, and after a brief conversation with the
      Speaker the matter was dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, as may be supposed, a considerable time before the debate could
      assume its due decorum and solemnity after an incident like this; for
      although hostile collisions were neither few nor unfrequent, an insult of
      so violent a character had never before been witnessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, however, order was restored, and another speaker addressed the
      House. All had assumed its wonted propriety, when a messenger delivered
      into Daly&rsquo;s hands a small sealed note; he glanced at the contents and rose
      immediately. Lord Castlereagh&rsquo;s quick eye caught the motion, and he at
      once called on the Speaker to interfere. &ldquo;I have myself seen a letter
      conveyed to the honorable member&rsquo;s hands,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it requires no
      peculiar gift of divination to guess the object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will satisfy the noble lord at once,&rdquo; said Daly; &ldquo;there is the letter I
      have received: I pledge my word of honor the subject is purely a private
      one, having no reference whatever to anything that has passed here.&rdquo; He
      held out the letter as he spoke, but Lord Castlereagh declined to peruse
      it, and expressed his regret at having made the remark. Daly bowed
      courteously to him, and left the House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sandy,&rdquo; said he, as soon as he reached the corridor, where his
      faithful follower stood waiting his coming, &ldquo;what success?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No sae bad,&rdquo; said Sandy. &ldquo;I &lsquo;ve got a wherry, ane of them Wicklow craft;
      she&rsquo;s only half-decked, but she&rsquo;s a stout-looking sea-boat, and broad in
      the beam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the wind, how&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it should be,&mdash;west, or west wi&rsquo; a point north.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there enough of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough! I trow there is,&rdquo; said Sanders, with a grin; &ldquo;if there be no a
      blast too much. Hear till it now.&rdquo; And, as if waiting for the remark, a
      tremendous gust of wind shook the strong building, while the clanking
      sound of falling slates and chimney-pots resounded through the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s music for ye,&rdquo; said Sandy; &ldquo;there came a clap like that when I
      had a&rsquo;maist made the bargain, and the carles would no budge without ten
      guineas mair. I promised them fifty, and the handsel whatever your honor
      liked after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&mdash;quite right,&rdquo; said Daly, wishing to stop details he
      never listened to with patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a&rsquo; right, I know weel enough,&rdquo; said Sandy, querulously; &ldquo;but it wad
      no be a&rsquo; right av ye went yersel&rsquo;; they &lsquo;d have a gude penny, forbye what
      I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what say the fellows of this wind,&mdash;is it like to last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will blow hard from the west for three or four days mair, and then
      draw round to the north.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we shall get to Liverpool before noon to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Sandy, with a low, dry laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I mean if we do get there. You told them I &lsquo;d double the pay if we
      catch the American ship in the Mersey. I&rsquo;d triple it; let them know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They canna do mair than they can do: ten pounds is as good as ten
      hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While this conversation was going forward, they had walked on together,
      and were now at the entrance door of the House, where a group of four
      persons stood under the shadow of the portico.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Daly, I presume,&rdquo; said one, advancing, and touching his hat in
      salutation. &ldquo;We have waited somewhat impatiently for your coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should regret it, sir, if I was aware you did me the honor to expect
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the friend of Serjeant Nickolls, sir,&rdquo; said the other, in a voice
      meant to be eloquently meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your sake, the fact is to be deplored,&rdquo; answered Daly, calmly. &ldquo;But
      proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a great effort to subdue his passion, the other resumed: &ldquo;It does not
      require your experience in such matters to know that the insult you have
      passed upon a high-minded and honorable gentleman&mdash;the gross and
      outrageous insult&mdash;should be atoned for by a meeting. We are here for
      this purpose, ready to accompany you, as soon as you have provided
      yourself with a friend, to wherever you appoint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you aware,&rdquo; said Daly, in a whisper, &ldquo;that I am bound over in heavy
      recognizances&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, indeed!&rdquo; interrupted the other; &ldquo;that, perhaps, may explain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain what, sir?&rdquo; said Daly, as he grasped the formidable weapon which,
      more club than walking-stick, he invariably carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant nothing; I would only observe&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never observe, sir, when there&rsquo;s nothing to be remarked. I was informing
      you that I am bound over to keep the peace in this same kingdom of
      Ireland; circumstances compel me to be in England to-morrow morning,&mdash;circumstances
      of such moment that I have myself hired a vessel to convey me thither,&mdash;and
      although the object of my journey is far from agreeable, I shall deem it
      one of the happiest coincidences of my life if it can accommodate your
      friend&rsquo;s wishes. Nothing prevents my giving him the satisfaction he
      desires on English ground. I have sincere pleasure in offering him, and
      every gentleman of his party, a passage over&mdash;the tide serves in half
      an hour. Eh, Sandy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At a quarter to twelve, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wind is fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a hurricane,&rdquo; replied the other, almost shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It blows fresh,&rdquo; was Daly&rsquo;s cool remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment or two the stranger returned to his party, with whom he
      talked eagerly, and the voices of the others were also heard, speaking in
      evident excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the pistols safe, Sandy?&rdquo; whispered Daly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They &lsquo;re a&rsquo; safe, and in the wherry; but you &lsquo;ll no want them this time,
      I trow,&rdquo; said Sandy, with a shrug of his shoulders; &ldquo;yon folk would rather
      bide where they are the night, than tak&rsquo; a bit o&rsquo; pleasure in the
      Channel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daly smiled, and turned away to hide it, when the stranger again came
      forward. &ldquo;I have consulted with my friends, Mr. Daly, who are also the
      friends of Serjeant Nickolls; they are of opinion that, under the
      circumstances of your being bound over, this affair cannot with propriety
      go further, although it might not, perhaps, be unreasonable to expect that
      you, feeling the peculiar situation in which you stand, might express some
      portion of regret at the utterance of this most severe attack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are really misinformed on the whole of the business,&rdquo; said Daly. &ldquo;In
      the few words I offered to the House, I was but responding to the question
      of your friend, who asked, I think somewhat needlessly, &lsquo;Where was Bagenal
      Daly?&rsquo; I have no regrets to express for any terms I applied to him, though
      I may feel sorry that the forms of the House prevented my saying more. I
      am ready to meet him now; or, as he seems to dislike a breeze, when the
      weather is calmer. Tell him so; but tell him besides, that if he utters
      one syllable in my absence that the most malevolent gossip of a club-room
      can construe into an imputation on me, by G&mdash;d I&rsquo;ll break every bone
      in his cowardly carcass! Come, Sandy, lead on. Good evening, sir. I wish
      you a bolder friend, or better weather.&rdquo; So saying, he moved forward, and
      was soon hastening towards the North Wall, where the wherry was moored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unco like the night we were wrecked in the Gulf,&rdquo; said Sandy. &ldquo;I
      mind the moon had that same blue color, and the clouds were a&rsquo; below, and
      none above her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is, Sandy,&mdash;there &lsquo;s a heavy sea outside, I &lsquo;m sure. How many
      men have we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four, and a bit o&rsquo; a lad that&rsquo;s as gude as anither. Lord save us! there
      was a flash! I wish it wud come to rain, and beat down the sea; we &lsquo;d have
      aye wind enough after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does she lie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yonder, sir, where you see the light bobbing. By my certie, but the
      chiels were no far wrang. A bit fighting &lsquo;s hard bought by a trip to sea
      on such a night as this.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. TWO OF A TRADE
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the newspapers announced the division on the adjourned debate, they
      also proclaimed the flight of the defaulter; and, wide as was the
      disparity between the two events in point of importance, it would be
      difficult to say which more engaged the attention of the Dublin public on
      that morning, the majority for the Minister, or the published perfidy of
      &ldquo;Honest Tom Gleeson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such is, however, the all-engrossing interest of a local topic, aided, as
      in the present case, by almost incredulous amazement, the agent&rsquo;s flight
      was talked of and discussed in circles where the great political event was
      heard as a matter of course. Where had he fled to? What sum had he carried
      away with him? Who would be the principal losers? were all the questions
      eagerly discussed, but none of which excited so much diversity of opinion
      as the single one: What was the cause of his defalcation? His agencies
      were numerous and profitable, his mode of life neither extravagant nor
      ostentatious; how could a man with so few habits of expense have
      contracted debts of any considerable amount, or what circumstances could
      induce him to relinquish a station of respectability and competence for a
      life-long of dishonorable exile?
    </p>
    <p>
      Such has been our progress of late years in the art of revealing to the
      world at large the hidden springs of every action and event around us that
      a secret is in reality the only thing now impossible. Forty-five years
      ago, this wonderful exercise of knowledge was in a great measure unknown;
      the guessers were then a large and respectable class in society, and men
      were content with what mathematicians call approximation. In our own more
      accurate days, what between the newspaper, the club-room, and &ldquo;&lsquo;Change,&rdquo;
       such mystery is no longer practicable. One day, or two at furthest, would
      now proclaim every item in a man&rsquo;s schedule, and afford that most
      sympathetic of all bodies, the world, the fruitful theme of expatiating on
      his folly or his criminality. In the times we refer to, however, it was
      only the &ldquo;Con Heffermans&rdquo; of society that ventured even to speculate on
      the secret causes of these events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the debate had lasted from eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening to past
      eleven on the following morning, before twelve Mr. Heffernan&rsquo;s carriage
      was at the door, and the owner, without any trace of fatigue, set off to
      ascertain so much as might be learned of this strange and unexpected
      catastrophe. It was no mere passion to know the current gossip of the day,
      no prying taste for the last piece of scandal in circulation,&mdash;Con
      Heffernan was above such weaknesses; but he had a habit&mdash;one which
      some men practise even yet with success&mdash;of whenever the game was
      safe, taking credit to himself for casualties in which he had no possible
      connection, and attributing events in which he had no share to his own
      direct influence. After all, he was in this only imitating the great
      navigators of the globe, who have established the rule that discovery
      gives a right only second to actual creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was, however, a really provoking case; no one knew anything of
      Gleeson&rsquo;s embarrassments. Several of those for whom he acted as agent were
      in Dublin, but they were more amazed than all others at his flight; most
      of them had settled accounts with him very lately, some men owed him small
      sums. &ldquo;Darcy perhaps knows something about him,&rdquo; was a speech Heffernan
      heard more than once repeated; but Darcy&rsquo;s house was shut up, and the
      servant announced &ldquo;he had left town that morning.&rdquo; Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly was
      the next chance; not that he had any direct intercourse with Gleeson, but
      his general acquaintanceship with moneyed men and matters made him a
      likely source of information; while a small sealed note addressed to Dr.
      Hickman was in possession of a banker with whom Gleeson had transacted
      business the day before his departure. But O&rsquo;Reilly had left town with his
      son. &ldquo;The doctor, sir, is here still; he does not go before to-morrow,&rdquo;
       said the servant, who, knowing that Heffernan was a person of some
      consequence in the Dublin world, thought proper to give this piece of
      unasked news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give Mr. Con Heffernan&rsquo;s compliments, and say he would be glad
      to have the opportunity of a few minutes&rsquo; conversation?&rdquo; The servant
      returned immediately, and showed him upstairs into a back drawing-room,
      where, before a table covered with law papers and parchments, sat the
      venerable doctor. He had not as yet performed the usual offices of a
      toilet, and, with unshaven chin and uncombed hair, looked the most
      melancholy contrast of age, neglect, and misery, with the gorgeous
      furniture of a most splendid apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his head as the door opened, and stared fixedly at the
      new-comer, with an expression at once fierce and anxious, so that
      Heffernan, when speaking of him afterwards, said that, &ldquo;Dressed as he was,
      in an old flannel morning-gown, dotted with black tufts, he looked for all
      the world like a sick tiger making his will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your humble servant, sir,&rdquo; said he, coldly, as Heffernan advanced with an
      air of cordiality; nor were the words and the accents they were uttered in
      lost upon the man they were addressed to. He saw how the land lay, in a
      second, and said eagerly, &ldquo;He has not left town, I trust, sir; I sincerely
      hope your son has not gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, he&rsquo;s off; I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;d wait for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too precipitate,&mdash;too rash by far, Mr. Hickman,&rdquo; said Heffernan,
      seating himself, and wiping his forehead with an air of well-assumed
      chagrin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; repeated the old man two or three times over, while he lowered
      his spectacles to his nose, and began hunting among his papers, as though
      he had other occupation in hand of more moment than the present topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you aware, sir,&rdquo; said Heffernan, drawing his chair close up, and
      speaking in a most confidential whisper,&mdash;&ldquo;are you aware, sir, that
      your son mistook the signal,&mdash;that when Mr. Corry took out his
      handkerchief and opened it on his knee, that it was in token of Lord
      Castlereagh&rsquo;s acquiescence of Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s demand,&mdash;that, in short,
      the peerage was at that moment his own if he wished it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The look of dogged incredulity in the old man&rsquo;s face would have silenced a
      more sensitive advocate than Heffer-nan; but he went on: &ldquo;If any one
      should feel angry at what has occurred, I am the person; I was the
      guarantee for your son&rsquo;s vote, and I have now to meet Lord Castle-reagh
      without one word of possible explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hickman told me,&rdquo; said the old man, with a voice steady and composed,
      &ldquo;that if Mr. Corry did not raise the handkerchief to his mouth, the terms
      were not agreed upon; that opening it before him only meant the bargain
      was not quite off: more delay, more talk, Mr. Heffernan; and I think there
      was enough of that already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A complete mistake, sir,&mdash;a total misconception on his part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just like Beecham being blackballed at the club,&rdquo; said the doctor, with a
      sarcastic bitterness all his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With that, of course, we cannot be charged,&rdquo; said Heffernan. &ldquo;Why was he
      put up without our being apprised of it? The blackballing was Bagenal
      Daly&rsquo;s doing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I heard,&rdquo; interrupted the other; &ldquo;they told me that; and here, look
      here, here&rsquo;s Daly&rsquo;s bond for four thousand six hundred. Maybe he won&rsquo;t be
      so ready with his bank-notes as he was with his black ball&mdash;ay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, to go back to the affair of the House&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t go back to it, sir, if it&rsquo;s the same to you. I &lsquo;m glad, with all
      my heart, the folly is over,&mdash;sorra use I could see in it, except the
      expense, and there&rsquo;s plenty of that. The old families, as they call them,
      can&rsquo;t last forever, no more than old houses and old castles; there&rsquo;s an
      end of everything in time, and if Hickman waits, maybe his turn will come
      as others&rsquo; did before him. Where &lsquo;s the Darcys now, I &lsquo;d like to know?&mdash;&rdquo;
       Here he paused and stammered, and at last stopped dead short, an
      expression of as much confusion as age and wrinkles would permit covering
      his hard, contracted features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say truly,&rdquo; said Heffernan, finishing what he guessed to be the
      sentiment,&mdash;&ldquo;you say truly, the Darcys have run their race; when
      men&rsquo;s incumbrances have reached the point that his have, family influence
      soon decays. Now, this business of Gleeson&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; Had he fired a shot
      close to the old man&rsquo;s ear he could not have startled him more effectually
      than by the mention of this name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of Gleeson?&rdquo; said he, drawing in his breath, and holding on the
      chair with both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that he is gone,&mdash;fled away no one knows where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gleeson! Honest Tom Gleeson ran away!&rdquo; exclaimed Hickman; &ldquo;no, no, that&rsquo;s
      impossible,&mdash;I&rsquo;d never believe that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange enough, sir, that the paragraphs here have not convinced you,&rdquo;
       said Heffernan, taking up the newspaper which lay on the table, and where
      the mark of snuffy fingers denoted the very passage in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! I did n&rsquo;t notice it before,&rdquo; muttered the doctor, as he took up the
      paper, affecting to read, but in reality to conceal his own confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say the news nearly killed Darcy; he only heard it when going into
      the House last night, and was seized with an apoplectic fit, and carried
      home insensible.&rdquo; This latter was, it is perhaps needless to say, pure
      invention of Heffernan, who found it necessary to continue talking as a
      means of detecting old Hickman&rsquo;s game. &ldquo;Total ruin to that family of
      course results. Gleeson had raised immense sums to pay off the debts, and
      carried all away with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; muttered the doctor, as he seemed greatly occupied in arranging his
      papers on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;ll be a loser too, sir, by all accounts,&rdquo; added Heffernan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much,&mdash;a mere trifle,&rdquo; said the doctor, without looking up from
      the papers. &ldquo;But maybe he&rsquo;s not gone, after all; I won&rsquo;t believe it yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There seems little doubt on that head,&rdquo; said Heffernan; &ldquo;he changed three
      thousand pounds in notes for gold at Ball&rsquo;s after the bank was closed on
      Tuesday, and then went over to Finlay&rsquo;s, where he said he had a lodgment
      to make. He left his great-coat behind him, and never came back for it. I
      found that paper&mdash;it was the only one&mdash;in the breast pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? what is it?&rdquo; repeated the old man, clutching eagerly at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of any consequence,&rdquo; said Heffernan, smiling; and he handed him a
      printed notice, setting forth that the United States barque, the
      &ldquo;Congress,&rdquo; of five hundred tons burden, would sail for New York on
      Wednesday, the 16th instant, at an hour before high water. &ldquo;That looked
      suspicious, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Heffernan; &ldquo;and on inquiry I found he had
      drawn largely out of, not only the banks in town, but from the provincial
      ones also. Now, that note addressed to yourself, for instance&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What note?&rdquo; said Hickman, starting round as his face became pale as
      ashes; &ldquo;give it to me&mdash;give it at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Heffernan held it firmly between his fingers, and merely shook his
      head, while, with a gentle smile, he said, &ldquo;The banker who intrusted this
      letter to my hands was well aware of what importance it might prove in a
      court of justice, should this disastrous event demand a legal
      investigation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old doctor listened with breathless interest to every word of this
      speech, and merely muttered at the close the words, &ldquo;The note, the note!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have promised to restore the paper to the banker,&rdquo; said Heffernan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you shall,&mdash;let me read it,&rdquo; cried Hickman, eagerly; and he
      clutched from Heffernan&rsquo;s fingers the document, before the other had
      seemingly determined whether he would yield to his demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is for you, sir,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;make what you can of it;&rdquo;
       and he threw the paper across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The note contained merely the words, &ldquo;Ten thousand pounds.&rdquo; There was no
      signature or any date, but the handwriting was Gleeson&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten thousand pounds,&rdquo; repeated Heffernan, slowly; &ldquo;a large sum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; chimed in Hickman, with a grin of self-satisfaction, while a
      consciousness that the mystery, whatever it might be, was beyond the reach
      of Heffernan&rsquo;s skill, gave him a look of excessive cunning, which sat
      strangely on features so old and time-worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Hickman,&rdquo; said Heffernan, as he arose to take leave, &ldquo;I have
      neither the right nor the inclination to pry into any man&rsquo;s secrets. This
      affair of Gleeson&rsquo;s will be sifted to the bottom one day or other, and
      that small transaction of the ten thousand pounds as well as the rest. It
      was not to discuss him or his fortunes I came here. I hoped to have seen
      Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly, and explained away a very serious misconception. Lord
      Castlereagh regrets it, not for the sake of the loss of Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s
      support, valuable as that unquestionably is, but because a wrong
      interpretation would seem to infer that the conduct of the Treasury bench
      was disingenuous. You will, I trust, make this explanation for me, and in
      the name of his Lordship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, I won&rsquo;t promise it,&rdquo; said old Hickman, looking up from a long
      column of figures which he was for some minutes poring over; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      understand them things at all; if Bob wanted to be a lord, &lsquo;t is more than
      ever I did,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t see much pleasure there is in being a gentleman.
      I know, for my part, I &lsquo;d rather sit in the back parlor of my little shop
      in Loughrea, where I could have a chat over a tumbler of punch with a
      neighbor, than all the grandeur in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These simple, unostentatious tastes do you credit before the world, sir,&rdquo;
       said Heffernan, with a well put-on look of admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether they do or not,&rdquo; said Hickman, &ldquo;but I know they help
      to make a good credit with the bank, and that&rsquo;s better&mdash;ay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heffernan affected to relish the joke, and descended the stairs, laughing
      as he went; but scarcely had he reached his carriage, however, than he
      muttered a heavy malediction on the sordid old miser whose iniquities were
      not less glaring because Con had utterly failed to unravel anything of his
      mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Lord Castlereagh&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said he to the footman, and then lay back to
      ponder over his late interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noble Secretary was not up when Con arrived, but had left orders that
      Mr. Heffernan should be shown up to his room whenever he came. It was now
      about five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and Lord Castlereagh, wrapped up in a
      loose morning-gown, lay on the bed where he had thrown himself, without
      undressing, on reaching home. A debate of more than fifteen hours, with
      all its strong and exciting passages, had completely exhausted his
      strength, while the short and disturbed sleep had wearied rather than
      refreshed him. The bed and the table beside it were covered with the
      morning papers and open letters and despatches, for, tired as he was, he
      could not refrain from learning the news of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my Lord,&rdquo; said Heffernan, with his habitual smile, as he stepped
      noiselessly across the floor, &ldquo;I believe I may wish you joy at last,&mdash;the
      battle is gained now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heigho!&rdquo; was the reply of the Secretary, while he extended two fingers of
      his hand in salutation. &ldquo;What hour is it, Heffernan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is near five; but really there &lsquo;s not a creature to be seen in the
      streets, and, except old Killgobbin airing his pocket-handkerchief at the
      fire, not a soul at the Club. Last night&rsquo;s struggle has nearly killed
      every one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this Mr. Gleeson that has run off with so much money,&mdash;did
      you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, we all knew &lsquo;honest Tom Gleeson.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that was his sobriquet, was it?&rdquo; said the Secretary, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my Lord, such was he,&mdash;or such, at least, was he believed to
      be, till yesterday evening. You know it&rsquo;s the last glass of wine always
      makes a man tipsy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is ruined, Heffernan,&mdash;any of our friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As yet there&rsquo;s no saying. Drogheda will lose something considerable, I
      believe; but at the banks the opinion is that Darcy will be the heaviest
      loser of any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Knight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the Knight of Gwynne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sincerely sorry to hear it,&rdquo; said Lord Castlereagh, with an energy
      of tone he had not displayed before; &ldquo;if I had met half-a-dozen such men
      as he is, I should have had some scruples&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, and at the
      instant caught sight of a very peculiar smile on Heffernan&rsquo;s features;
      then, suddenly changing the topic, he said, &ldquo;What of Nickolls,&mdash;is he
      shot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my Lord, there was no meeting. Bagenal Daly, so goes the story,
      proposed going over to the Isle of Man in a row-boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, last night!&rdquo; said the Secretary, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, when it was blowing the roof off the Custom House; he offered him
      his choice of weapons, from a blunderbuss to a harpoon, and his own
      distance, over a handkerchief, or fifty yards with a rifle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was Nickolls deaf to all such seductions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, my Lord; even when Daly said to him, &lsquo;I think it a public duty
      to shoot a fellow like you, for, if you are suffered to live, the
      Government will make a judge of you one of these days.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What profound solicitude for the purity of the judgment seat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daly has reason to think of these things; he has been in the dock
      already, and perhaps suspects he may be again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Darcy!&rdquo; said Lord Castlereagh to himself, in a half whisper, &ldquo;I wish
      I knew you were not a sufferer by this fellow&rsquo;s flight. By the bye,
      Heffernan, sit down and write a few lines to Forester; say that Lord
      Cornwallis is greatly displeased at his protracted absence. I am tired of
      making excuses for him, and as I dine there to-day, I shall be tormented
      all the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darcy&rsquo;s daughter is very good-looking, I hear,&rdquo; said Heffernan, smiling
      slyly, &ldquo;and should have a large fortune if matters go right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very possibly; but old Lady Wallincourt is the proudest dowager in
      England, and looks to the blood-royal for alliances. Forester is entirely
      dependent on her; and that reminds me of a most solemn pledge I made her
      to look after her &lsquo;dear Dick,&rsquo; and prevent any entanglement in this
      barbarous land,&mdash;as if I had nothing else to think of! Write at once,
      Heffernan, and order him up; say he &lsquo;ll lose his appointment by any
      further delay, and that I am much annoyed at his absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Heffernan descended to the library to write, Lord Castlereagh turned
      once more to sleep until it was time to dress for the Viceroy&rsquo;s dinner.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. &ldquo;A WARNING&rdquo; AND &ldquo;A PARTING.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      If we wanted any evidence of how little avail all worldly wisdom is, we
      might take it from the fact that our severest calamities are often
      impending us at the moments we deem ourselves most secure from misfortune.
      Thus was it that while the events were happening whose influence was to
      shadow over all the sunshine of her life, Lady Eleanor Darcy never felt
      more at ease. That same morning the post had brought her a letter from the
      Knight,&mdash;only a few lines, hastily written, but enough to allay all
      her anxiety. He spoke of law arrangements, then almost completed, by which
      any immediate pressure regarding money might be at once obviated, and
      promised, for the very first time in his life, to submit to any plan of
      retrenchment she desired to adopt. Had it been in her power, she could not
      have dictated lines more full of pleasant anticipation. The only drawback
      on the happiness of her lot in life was the wasteful extravagance of a
      mode of living which savored far more of feudal barbarism than of modern
      luxury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Partly from long habit and association, partly from indolence of
      character, but more than either from a compassionate consideration of
      those whose livelihood might be impaired by any change in his
      establishment, the Knight had resisted all suggestion of alteration. He
      viewed the very peculations around him as vested rights, and the most he
      could pledge himself to was, that when the present race died out he would
      not appoint any successors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same post that brought this pleasant letter, conveyed one of far less
      grateful import to Forester. It was a long epistle from his mother,
      carefully worded, and so characteristic withal, that if it were any part
      of our object to introduce that lady to our readers, we could not more
      easily do so than through her own letter. Such is not, however, our
      intention; enough if we say that it was a species of domestic homily,
      where moral principles and worldly wisdom found themselves so inextricably
      interwoven, no mean skill could have disentangled them. She had learned,
      as careful mothers somehow always contrive to learn, that her son was
      domesticated in the house with a very charming and beautiful girl, and the
      occasion seemed suitable to enforce some of those excellent precepts which
      hitherto had been deficient in force for want of a practical example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Lady Wallincourt limited herself to cautious counsels about falling in
      love with some rustic beauty in a remote region, Forester might have
      treated the advice as one of those matter-of-course events which cause no
      more surprise than the receipt of a printed circular; but she went
      further. She deemed this a fitting occasion to instruct her son into the
      mystery of that craft, which, in her own experience of life, she had seen
      make more than one man&rsquo;s fortune, and by being adepts in which many of her
      own family had attained to high and lasting honors. This science was
      neither more nor less than success in female society. &ldquo;I will not insult
      either your good taste or your understanding,&rdquo; wrote she, &ldquo;by any warning
      against falling in love in Ireland. Beauty is&mdash;France excepted&mdash;pretty
      equally distributed through the world; neither is there any nationality in
      good looks, for, nowadays, admixture of race has obliterated every
      peculiarity of origin. In all, then, that concerns manner, tone, and
      breeding, your own country possesses the true standard: every deviation
      from this is a fault. What is conventional must be right, because it is
      the exponent of general opinion on those topics for which each feels
      interested. Now, the Irish, my dear boy, the Irish are never conventional;
      they are clannish, provincial, peculiar, but never conventional. Their
      pride would seem to be rather to ruffle than fall in with the general
      sympathies of society. They forget that the social world is a great
      compact, and they are always striving for individual successes by personal
      distinction: this is the very acme of vulgarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they, however, are very indifferent models for imitation, they afford
      an excellent school for your own training; they are a shrewd,
      quick-sighted race, with a strong sense of the ludicrous, and are what the
      French call <i>malin</i> to a degree. To win favor among them without any
      subservient imitation of their own habits, which would be contemptible, is
      not over easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am rightly informed, you are at present well circumstanced to profit
      by my counsels. I am told of a very agreeable and very pretty girl with
      whom you ride and walk out constantly, and, far from feeling any maternal
      uneasiness,&mdash;for I trust I know my son,&mdash;I am rejoiced at the
      circumstance. Make the most of such an advantage by exercising your own
      abilities and powers of pleasing, give yourself the habit of talking your
      very best on every topic, without pedantry or any sign of premeditation.
      Practise that blending of courteous deference to a woman&rsquo;s opinions with a
      subdued consciousness of your own powers, which I have spoken to you of in
      your dear father&rsquo;s character. Seldom venture on an axiom, never tell an
      anecdote; be most guarded in any indulgence of humor: a laugh is the most
      dangerous of all triumphs. It is the habit to reproach us with our
      frigidity,&mdash;I believe not without reason; cultivate, then, a certain
      amount of warmth which may suggest the idea of earnestness, apart from all
      suspicion of enthusiasm, which I have often told you is low-lived. Watch
      carefully by what qualities your success is more advanced; examine
      yourself as to what defects you experience in your own character; make
      yourself esteemed as a means of being estimable; win regard, and the habit
      of pleasing will give a charm to your manner, even when you are not
      desirous to secure affection. Your poor dear father often confessed the
      inestimable advantages of his first affairs of the heart, and used to say,
      whenever by any adroit exercise of his captivation he had gained over an
      adverse Maid of Honor, I owe that to Louisa, for such was the name of the
      young lady,&mdash;I forget now who she was. The mechanism of the heart is
      alike in all lands; the means of success in Ireland will win victory where
      the prize is higher. In all this, remember, I by no means advise you to
      sport with any young lady&rsquo;s feelings, nor to win more of her affection
      than may assure you that the entire could also become yours: a polite
      chess-player will rest satisfied to say, &lsquo;check,&rsquo; without pushing the
      adversary to &lsquo;mate.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will soon be time you should leave the army, and I hope to find you
      have acquired some other education by the pursuit than mere knowledge of
      dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is a short specimen of the maternal Machiavelism by which &ldquo;the most
      fascinating woman of her set&rdquo; hoped to instruct her son, and teach him the
      road to fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the fatal depravity of every human heart that any subtle appeal to
      selfishness, if it fail to flex the victim to the will, at least shakes
      the strong sense of conscious rectitude, and makes our very worthiness
      seem weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forester&rsquo;s first impression was almost anger as he read these lines, the
      second time he perused them he was far less shocked, and at last was
      puzzled whether more to wonder at the keen worldly knowledge they
      betrayed, or the solicitude of that affection which consented to unveil so
      much of life for his guidance. The result of all these conflicting
      emotions was depression of spirits, and a discontent with himself and all
      the world; nor could the fascinations of that little circle in which he
      lived so intimately, subdue the feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Eleanor saw this, and exerted herself with all her wonted powers to
      amuse and interest him; Helen, too, delighted at the favorable change in
      her mother&rsquo;s spirits, contributed to sustain the tone of light-hearted
      pleasantry, while she could not restrain a jest upon Forester&rsquo;s unusual
      gloominess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manner whose fascinations had hitherto so many charms, now almost
      irritated him; the poison of suspicion had been imbibed, and he
      continually asked himself, what if the very subtlety his mother&rsquo;s letter
      spoke of was now practised by her? If all the varied hues of captivation
      her changing humor wore were but the deep practised lures of coquetry? His
      self-love was piqued by the thought, as well as his perceptive shrewdness,
      and he set himself, as he believed, to decipher her real nature; but, such
      is the blindness of mere egotism, in reality to misunderstand and mistake
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      How often it happens in life that the moment a doubt prevails as to some
      trait or feature of our character, we should exactly seize upon that very
      instant to indulge in some weakness or passing levity that may strengthen
      a mere suspicion, or make it a certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen never seemed gayer than on this evening, scarcely noticing Forester,
      save when to jest upon his morose and silent mood; she talked, and
      laughed, and sang in all the free joyousness of a happy heart,
      unconsciously displaying powers of mind and feeling which, in calmer
      moments, lay dormant and concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening wore on, and Helen had just risen from her harp,&mdash;where
      she was playing one of those wild, half-sad, half-playful melodies of her
      country,&mdash;when a gentle tap came to the door, and, without waiting
      for leave to enter, old Tate appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man was pale, and his features wore an expression of extreme
      terror; but he was doing his very utmost, as it seemed, to struggle
      against some inward fear, as, with a smile of far more melancholy than
      mirth, he said, &ldquo;Did ye hear it, my Lady? I &lsquo;m sure ye heerd it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard what, Tate?&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The&mdash;but I see Miss Helen&rsquo;s laughing at me. Ah! don&rsquo;t then, Miss,
      darlin&rsquo;,&mdash;don&rsquo;t laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it, Tate? Tell us what you heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Banshee, my Lady! Ay, there &lsquo;s the way,&mdash;I knew how &lsquo;t would be;
      you &lsquo;d only laugh when I tould you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was it you heard it?&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, affecting seriousness to
      gratify the old man&rsquo;s superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under the east window, my Lady; then it moved across the flower-garden,
      and down to the shore beneath the big rocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it like, Tate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;T was like a funeral &lsquo;coyne&rsquo; first, Miss, when ye heerd it far away in
      the mountain; and then it rose, and swelled fuller and stronger, till it
      swam all round me, and at last died away to the light, soft cry of an
      infant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, Tate; it was Captain Forester sighing. I never heard a better
      description in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! don&rsquo;t laugh, my Lady,&mdash;don&rsquo;t now, Miss Helen, dear. I never knew
      luck nor grace come of laughing when the warnin&rsquo; was come. &lsquo;T is the
      Captain, there, looks sad and thoughtful,&mdash;the Heavens bless him for
      it! He knows &lsquo;tis no time for laughing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forester might have accepted the eulogy in better part, perhaps, had he
      understood it; but as it was, he turned abruptly about, and asked Lady
      Eleanor for an explanation of the whole mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tate thinks he has heard&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinks!&rdquo; interrupted the old man, with a sorrowful gesture of both hands.
      &ldquo;Musha! I&rsquo;d take the Gospel on it; I heard it as plain as I hear your
      Ladyship now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Eleanor smiled, and went on&mdash;&ldquo;the cry of the Banshee, that
      dreadful warning which, in the superstition of the country, always
      betokens death, or at least some great calamity, to the house it is heard
      to wail over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A polite attention, to say the least,&rdquo; said Forester, smiling
      sarcastically, &ldquo;of the witch or fairy or whatever it is, to announce to
      people an approaching misfortune. And has every cabin got its own Ban&mdash;what
      do you call it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cabins has none,&rdquo; said Tate, with a loot of severe reproach, the most
      remote possible from his habitual air of deference; &ldquo;&lsquo;tis only the ouldest
      and most ancient families, like his honor the Knight&rsquo;s, has a Banshee. But
      it&rsquo;s no use talking; I see nobody believes me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Tate, I do,&rdquo; cried Helen, with an earnestness of manner, either
      really felt, or assumed to gratify the poor old man&rsquo;s superstitious
      veneration; &ldquo;just tell me how you heard it first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like that!&rdquo; whispered Tate, as he held up his hand to enforce silence;
      and at the same instant a low, plaintive cry was heard, as if beneath the
      very window. The accent was not of pain or suffering, but of melancholy so
      soft, so touching, and yet so intense, that it stilled every voice within
      the room, where now each long-drawn breath was audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a lurking trait of superstition in every human heart, which will
      resist, at some one moment or other, every effort of reason and every
      scoff of irony. An instant before, and Forester was ready to jest with the
      old man&rsquo;s terrors, and now his own spirit was not all devoid of them. The
      feeling was, however, but of a moment&rsquo;s duration; suspicion again assumed
      its sway, and, seizing his hat, he rushed from the room, to search the
      flower-garden and examine every spot where any one might lie concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he goes now, as if he could see <i>her</i>; and maybe &lsquo;t would be
      as well for him he did n&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Tate, as, in contempt of the English
      incredulity, he gazed after the eager youth. &ldquo;Is his honor well, my Lady?&mdash;when
      did you hear from him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We heard this very day, Tate; he is perfectly well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Master Lionel&mdash;the captain, I mane&mdash;but I only think he&rsquo;s a
      child still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite well, too,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t alarm yourself, Tate; you know how
      sadly the wind can sigh through these old walls at times, and under the
      yew-trees, too, it sounds drearily; I &lsquo;ve shuddered to myself often, as I
      &lsquo;ve heard it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God grant it!&rdquo; said old Tate, piously; but the shake of his head and the
      muttering sounds between his teeth attested that he laid no such
      flattering unction to his heart as mere disbelief might offer. &ldquo;&lsquo;T is n&rsquo;t
      a death-cry, anyhow, Miss Helen,&rdquo; whispered he to Miss Darcy, as he moved
      towards the door; &ldquo;for I went down to the back of the abbey, where Sir
      Everard was buried, and all was still there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go to bed now, Tate, and don&rsquo;t think more about it; if the wind&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! the wind! the wind!&rdquo; said he, querulously; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the way it always
      is,&mdash;as if God Almighty had no other way of talking to our hearts
      than the cry of the night-wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Captain Forester, what success? Have you confronted the spectre?&rdquo;
       said Lady Eleanor, as he re-entered the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except having fallen into a holly-bush, where I rivalled the complaining
      accents of the old witch, I have no adventure to recount; all is perfectly
      still and tranquil without.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have got your cheek scratched for following the siren,&rdquo; said Lady
      Eleanor, laughing; &ldquo;pray put another log on the fire, it is fearfully
      chilly here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Tate withdrew slowly and unwillingly; he saw that his intelligence had
      failed to produce a proper sense of terror on their minds; and his own
      load of anxiety was heavier, from want of participation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation, by that strange instinct which influences the least as
      well as the most credulous people, now turned on the superstitions of the
      peasantry, and many a legend and story were remembered by Lady Eleanor and
      her daughter, in which these popular beliefs formed a chief feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is unfair and unwise,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, at the conclusion of one of
      these stories, &ldquo;to undervalue such influences; the sailor, who passes his
      life in dangers, watches the elements with an eye and an air that training
      have rendered almost preternaturally observant, and he sees the sign of
      storm where others would but mark the glow of a red sunset; so among a
      primitive people communing much with their own hearts in solitary,
      unfrequented places, imagination becomes developed in undue proportion,
      and the mind seeks relief in creative efforts from the wearying sense of
      loneliness; but even these are less idle fancies than conclusions come to
      from long and deep thought. Some strange process of analogy would seem the
      parent of superstitions which we know to be common to all lands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which means, that you half believe in a Banshee!&rdquo; said Forester, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so; but that I cannot consent to despise the frame of mind which
      suggests these beliefs, although I have no faith in the apparitions. Poor
      Tate, there, had never dreamed of hearing the Banshee cry if some painful
      thought of impending misfortune had not suggested her presence; his fears
      may not be unfounded, although the form they take be preternatural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I protest against all such plausibilities,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;I &lsquo;m for the
      Banshee, as the Republicans say in France, &lsquo;one and indivisible.&rsquo; I &lsquo;ll
      not accept of natural explanations. Mr. Bagenal Daly says, we may well
      believe in spirits, when we put faith in the mere ghost of a Parliament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen is throwing out a bait for a political discussion,&rdquo; said Lady
      Eleanor, laughing, &ldquo;and so I &lsquo;ll even say good night, Captain Forester,
      and pleasant dreams of the Banshee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forester rose and took his leave, which, somehow, was colder than usual.
      His mother&rsquo;s counsels had got possession of his mind, and distrust
      perverted every former source of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her manner is all coquetry,&rdquo; said he, angrily, to himself, as he walked
      towards his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor fellow! and what if it were? Coquetry is but a gilding, to be sure;
      but it can never be well laid on if the substance beneath is not a
      precious metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, at the place where the river opened into the sea, a small inlet
      of the bay guarded by two bold and rocky headlands, between which the tide
      swept with uncommon violence, accumulating in time a kind of bar, over
      which, even in calm weather, the waves were lashed into breakers, while
      the waters within were still as a mountain lake. The ancient ruin we have
      already alluded to passingly, stood on a little eminence fronting this
      small creek, and although unmarked by any architectural beauty, or any
      pretensions, save the humble possession of four rude walls pierced by
      narrow windows, and a low doorway formed of three large stones, was yet,
      in the eyes of the country people, endowed with some superior holiness,&mdash;so
      it is certain the little churchyard around bespoke. It was crowded with
      graves, whose humble monuments consisted in wooden crosses, decorated in
      recent cases with little garlands of paper or wild flowers, as piety or
      affection suggested. The fragments of ship-timber around showed that they
      who slept beneath had been mostly fishermen, for the chapel was peculiarly
      esteemed by them; and at the opening of the fishing season a mass was
      invariably offered here for the success of the herring-fishery, by a
      priest from a neighboring parish, whose expenses were willingly and
      liberally rewarded by the fishermen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In exact proportion with the reverence in which this spot was regarded by
      day was the fear and dread entertained of it by night. Stories of ghosts
      and evil spirits were rife far and near of that lonely ruin, and the
      hardiest seamen, who would brave the wild waves of the Atlantic, would not
      venture alone within these deserted walls after dark. Helen remembered, as
      a child, having been once there after sunset, induced by an intense
      curiosity to hear or see something of those sounds and shapes her nurse
      had told of, and what alarm her absence created among the household
      increased when it was discovered where she had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same strange desire to hear if it might be that sad and wailing voice
      which all had so distinctly heard in the drawing-room, led her, when she
      had wished her mother good-night, to leave her chamber, and, crossing the
      flower-garden, to descend to the beach by a small door which opened to a
      little pathway down to the sea. When the superstitions whose terrors have
      affrighted childhood are either conquered by reason or uprooted by worldly
      influence, they still leave behind them a strange passion for the
      marvellous, which in imaginative temperaments is frequently greatly
      developed, and becomes a great source of enjoyment or suffering to its
      possessor. Helen Darcy&rsquo;s nature was of this kind, and she would gladly
      have accepted all the tremors and terrors of her nursery days to feel once
      again that intense awe, that anxious heart-beating expectancy, a ghost
      story used to create within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was calm and starlit, the sea was tranquil and unruffled, except
      where the bar broke the flow of the tide, and marked by a long line of
      foam the struggling breakers, whose hoarse plash was heard above the
      rippling on the strand. Even in the rocky caves all was still, not an echo
      resounded within those dreary caverns where at times the thunder&rsquo;s self
      was not louder. Helen reached the little churchyard; she knew every path
      and foot-track through it, and at last, strolling leisurely onward,
      entered the ruin and sat down within the deep window that looked over the
      sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time her attention was directed seaward, watching the waves as
      they reflected back the spangled heaven, or sank again in dark shadow,
      when suddenly she perceived the figure of a man, who appeared slowly
      pacing the beach immediately beneath where she sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could have brought any one there at such an hour she could not
      imagine; and however few her terrors of the world of spirits, she would
      gladly at this moment have been safe within the abbey. While she debated
      with herself how to act&mdash;whether to remain in her present
      concealment, or venture on a sudden flight&mdash;the figure halted exactly
      under the window. Her doubts and fears were now speedily resolved, for she
      perceived it was Forester, who, induced by the beauty of the night, had
      thus strolled out upon the shore. &ldquo;What if I should put his courageous
      incredulity to the test?&rdquo; thought Helen; &ldquo;the moment is propitious now. I
      could easily imitate the cry of the Banshee!&rdquo; The temptation was too
      strong to be resisted, and without further thought she uttered a low,
      thrilling wail, in an accent of most touching sorrow. Forester started and
      looked up, but the dark walls were in deep shadow; whatever his real
      feelings at the moment, he lost no time in clambering up the bank on which
      the ruin stood, and from which he rightly judged the sound proceeded.
      Helen was yet uncertain whether to attribute this step to terror or the
      opposite, when she heard his foot as he traversed the thickly-studded
      graveyard,&mdash;a moment more, and he would be in the church itself,
      where he could not fail to discover her by her white dress. But one chance
      offered of escape, which was to leap from the window down upon the strand:
      it was deeper than she fancied, nearly twice her own height; but then
      detection, for more than one good reason, was not to be thought of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen was not one of those who long hesitate when their minds are to be
      made up; she slipped noiselessly between the stone mullion and the side of
      the window, and sprang out; unfortunately one foot turned on a small
      stone, and she fell on the sand, while a slight accent of pain
      unconsciously broke from her. Before she could rise, Forester was beside
      her; with one arm round her waist, he half pressed, as he assisted her to
      recover her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, fair spirit,&rdquo; said he, jocularly, &ldquo;I have tracked you, it would
      seem;&rdquo; then, for the first time discovering it was Helen, he muttered in a
      different tone, &ldquo;I ask pardon, Miss Darcy; I really did not know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of that, Captain Forester,&rdquo; said she, disengaging herself from
      his aid. &ldquo;I certainly deserve a lesson for my silly attempt to frighten
      you, and I believe I have sprained my ankle. Will you kindly send Florence
      to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot leave you here alone, Miss Darcy; pray take my arm, and let me
      assist you back to the abbey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of deference he now spoke in, and the increasing pain, concurred
      to persuade her, and she accepted the proffered assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The absurdity of this adventure is not repaid by the pleasure of having
      frightened you,&rdquo; said she, laughing; &ldquo;if I could only say how terrified
      you were&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might indeed have said so,&rdquo; interrupted Forester, &ldquo;had I guessed the
      figure I saw leap out was yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was even higher than I thought,&rdquo; said she, avoiding to remark the
      fervent accents in which these words were spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forester was silent; his heart was full to bursting; the passion so lately
      dashed by doubts and suspicions returned with tenfold force now that he
      felt her arm within his own as step by step they moved along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in great pain, I fear,&rdquo; said he, tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not now. I am so much more ashamed of my folly than a sufferer from
      it that I could forgive the sprain if I could the silly notion that caused
      it. &lsquo;Twas an unlucky fancy, to say the least of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a pause, and although they walked but slowly, they were
      fast approaching the little gate that opened into the flower-garden.
      Forester was silent. &ldquo;Was it from this cause, or by some secret
      freemasonry of the female heart that she suspected what was passing in his
      mind, and exerted herself to move on more rapidly?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take time, Miss Darcy; not so fast; if not for your sake, for mine at
      least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last few words were scarcely above a whisper, but every one of them
      reached her to whom they were addressed; whether affecting not to hear
      them, or preferring to mistake their meaning, Helen made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said for <i>my</i> sake,&rdquo; resumed he, with a courage that demanded all
      his energy, &ldquo;because on these few moments the whole fortune of my future
      life is placed. I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Captain Forester,&rdquo; said she, smiling, &ldquo;this is not quite fair; I
      failed in my attempt to terrify you, and have paid the penalty: let there
      not be a further one of my listening to what I should not hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not hear it, Helen? Is the devotion of one even humble as I am, a
      thing to offend? Is it the less sincere that I feel how much you are above
      me in every way? Will not my very presumption prove how fervent is the
      passion that has made me forget all save itself,&mdash;all save you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Truth has its own accents, however weak the words it syllables. Helen
      laughed not now, but walked on with quicker steps; while the youth, the
      barrier once passed, poured forth with heartfelt eloquence his tale of
      love, recalling to her mind by many a slight, unnoticed trait, his
      long-pledged devotion; how he had watched and worshipped her, seeking to
      win favor in her eyes, and seem not all unworthy of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I cannot, dare not, ask in return for an affection
      which should repay my own; but let me hope that what I now speak, the
      devotion I pledge, is no rejected offering; that although you care not for
      me, you will not crush forever one who lives but in your smile, that you
      will give me time to show myself more worthy of the prize I strive for.
      There is no trial I would not dare&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must interrupt you, Captain Forester,&rdquo; said Helen, with a voice that
      all her efforts had not rendered quite steady; &ldquo;it would be an ungenerous
      requital for the sentiments you say you feel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say!&mdash;nay, Helen, I swear it, by every hope that now thrills within
      me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be,&rdquo; resumed she, tremulously, &ldquo;an ungenerous requital for this,
      were I to practise any deception on you. I am sincerely, deeply sorry to
      hear you speak as you have done. I had long since learned to regard you as
      the friend of Lionel, almost like a brother. The pleasure your society
      afforded one I am most attached to increased the feeling; and as intimacy
      increased between us, I thought how happy were it if the ambitions of life
      did not withdraw from home the sons whose kindness can be as thoughtful
      and as tender as that of the daughters of the house. Shall I confess it? I
      almost wished my brother like you; but yet all this was not love,&mdash;nay,
      for I will be frank, at whatever cost,&mdash;I had never felt this towards
      you, if I suspected your sentiments towards me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, dearest Helen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear me out. There is but one way in which the impropriety of such a
      meeting as this can be obviated, chance though it be, and that is, by
      perfect candor. I have told you the simple truth, not with any
      undervaluing sense of the affection you proffer, still less with any
      coquetry of reserve. I should be unworthy of the heart you offer me, since
      I could not give my own in exchange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you deny me all hope?&rdquo; said he, in an accent almost bursting with
      grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not arrogant enough to say I shall never change; but I am honest
      enough to tell you that I do not expect it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, then, Helen! I do not love you less that you have taught me to
      think more humbly of myself. Good-by&mdash;forever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is better it should come to this,&rdquo; said Helen, faintly; and she held
      out her hand towards him. &ldquo;Good-by, Forester!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pressed one long and burning kiss upon her hand, and turned away, while
      she, pushing open the door, entered the little garden. Scarcely, however,
      was the door closed behind her, when the calm courage in which she spoke
      forsook her, and she burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      So is it, the heart can be moved, even its most tender chords, when the
      touch that stirs it is less of love than sorrow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. SOME SAD REVELATIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was on the fourth day after the memorable debate we have briefly
      alluded to, that the Knight of Gwynne was sitting alone in one of the
      large rooms of his Dublin mansion. Although his servants had strict orders
      to say he had left town, he had not quitted the capital, but passed each
      day, from sunrise till late at night, in examining his various accounts,
      and endeavoring with what slight business knowledge he possessed, to
      ascertain the situation in which he stood, and how far Gleeson&rsquo;s flight
      had compromised him. There is no such chaotic confusion to the
      unaccustomed mind as the entangled web of long-standing moneyed
      embarrassments, and so Darcy found it. Bills for large sums had been
      passed, to provide for which, renewals had been granted, and this for a
      succession of years, until the debt accumulating had been met by a
      mortgage or a bond: many of these bills were missing&mdash;where were
      they? was the question, and what liability might yet attach to them?
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, loans had been raised more than once to pay off these encumbrances,
      the interest on which was duly charged in his account, and yet there was
      no evidence of these payments having been made; nor among the very last
      sent papers from Gleeson was there any trace of that bond, to release
      which the enormous sum of seventy thousand pounds had been raised. That
      the money was handed to Hickman, Bagenal Daly was convinced; the
      memorandum given him by Freney was a corroboration of the probability at
      least, but still there was no evidence of the transaction here. Even this
      was not the worst, for the Knight now discovered that the rental charged
      in his accounts was more than double the reality, Gleeson having for many
      years back practised the fraud of granting leases at a low, sometimes a
      merely nominal, rent, while he accepted renewal fines from the tenants,
      which he applied to his own purposes. In fact, it at length became
      manifest to Darcy&rsquo;s reluctant belief that his trusted agent had for years
      long pursued a systematic course of perfidy, merely providing money
      sufficient for the exigencies of the time, while he was, in reality,
      selling every acre of his estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knight&rsquo;s last hope was in the entail. &ldquo;I am ruined&mdash;I am a
      beggar, it is true!&rdquo; muttered he, as each new discovery broke upon him,
      &ldquo;but my boy, my dear Lionel, at my death will have his own again.&rdquo; This
      cherished dream was not of long duration, for to his horror he discovered
      a sale of a considerable part of the estate in which Lionel&rsquo;s name was
      signed as a concurring party. This was the crowning point of his
      affliction; the ruin was now utter, without one gleam of hope remaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      The property thus sold was that in the possession of the O&rsquo;Reillys, and
      the sale was dated the very day Lionel came of age. Darcy remembered well
      having signed his name to several papers on that morning. Gleeson had
      followed him from place to place, through the crowds of happy and
      rejoicing people assembled by the event, and at last, half vexed at the
      importunity, he actually put his name to several papers as he sat on
      horseback on the lawn: this very identical deed was thus signed; the
      writing was straggling and irregular as the motion of the horse shook his
      hand. So much for his own inconsiderate rashness, but how, or by what
      artifice was Lionel&rsquo;s signature obtained?
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had Lionel Darcy practised the slightest deception on his father;
      never concealed from him any difficulty or any embarrassment, but frankly
      confided to him his cares, as he would to one of his own age. How, then,
      had he been drawn into a step of this magnitude without apprising him?
      There was one explanation, and this was, that Glee-son persuaded the young
      man, that by thus sacrificing his own future rights he would be assisting
      his father, who, from motives of delicacy, could not admit of any
      negotiation in the matter, and that by ceding so much of his own property,
      he should relieve his father from present embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through all the revelation of the agent&rsquo;s guilt now opening before him,
      not one word of anger, one expression of passion, escaped the Knight till
      his eyes fell upon this paper; but then, grasping it in both hands, he
      shook in every limb with indignant rage, and in accents of bitterest hate
      invoked a curse upon his betrayer. The very sound of his own voice in that
      sileut chamber startled him, while a sick tremor crept through his frame
      at the unhallowed wish he uttered. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said he, with clasped hands,
      &ldquo;it is not for one like me, whose sensual carelessness has brought my own
      to ruin, to speak thus of another; may Heaven assist me, and pardon him
      that injured me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stunning effects of heavy calamity are destined in all likelihood to
      give time to rally against the blow&mdash;to permit exhausted Nature to
      fortify herself by even a brief repose against the harassing influences of
      deep sorrow. One who saw far into the human heart tells us that it is not
      the strongest natures are the first to recover from the shock of great
      misfortunes, but that &ldquo;light and frivolous spirits regain their elasticity
      sooner than those of loftier character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole extent of his ruin unfolded itself gradually before Darcy&rsquo;s
      eyes, until at length the accumulated load became too great to bear, and
      he sat in almost total unconsciousness gazing at the mass of law papers
      and accounts before him, only remembering at intervals, and then faintly,
      the nature of the investigation he was engaged in, and by an effort
      recalling himself again to the task: in this way passed the entire day we
      speak of. Brief struggles to exert himself in examining the various papers
      and letters on the table were succeeded by long pauses of apparent apathy,
      until, as evening drew near, these intervals of indifference grew longer,
      and he sat for hours in this scarce-waking condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long past midnight as a loud knocking was heard at the street door,
      and ere Darcy could sufficiently recall his wandering faculties from their
      revery, he felt a hand grasp his own&mdash;he looked up, and saw Bagenal
      Daly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Darcy,&rdquo; said he, in a low whisper, &ldquo;how stand matters here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruined!&rdquo; said he, in an accent hardly audible, but with a look that
      thrilled through the stern heart of Daly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, there must be a long space between <i>your</i> fortune and
      ruin yet. Have you seen any legal adviser?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of Gleeson, Bagenal, has he been heard of?&rdquo; said the Knight, not
      attending to Daly&rsquo;s question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has had the fitting end of a scoundrel. He leaped overboard in the
      Channel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; said Darcy, while he passed his hand across his eyes; &ldquo;his
      spirit was not all corrupted, Bagenal; he dared not to face the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Face the world! the villain, it was the gallows he had not courage to
      face. Don&rsquo;t speak one word of compassion about a wretch like him, or you
      &lsquo;ll drive me mad. There&rsquo;s no iniquity in the greatest crimes to compare
      with the slow, dastardly scoundrelism of your fair-faced swindler. It
      seems so, at least. The sailors told us that he went below immediately on
      their leaving the river, and, having locked the cabin door, spent his time
      in writing till they were in sight of the Holyhead light, when a sudden
      splash was heard, and a cry of &lsquo;A man overboard!&rsquo; called every one to the
      deck; then it was discovered that the fellow had opened one of the
      stern-windows and thrown himself into the sea. They brought me this open
      letter, the last, it is said, he ever wrote, and, though unaddressed,
      evidently meant for you. You need not read it; it contains nothing but the
      whining excuses of a scoundrel who bases his virtue on the fact that he
      was more coward than cheat. Strangest thing of all, he had no property
      with him beyond some few clothes, a watch, and about three hundred guineas
      in a purse. This was deposited by the skipper with the authorities in
      Liverpool; not a paper, not a document of any kind. Don&rsquo;t read that puling
      scrawl, Darcy; I have no patience with your pity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he had escaped with life, Bagenal,&rdquo; said Darcy, feelingly; &ldquo;it is
      a sad aggravation of all my sorrow to think of this man&rsquo;s suicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so he might, had he had the courage to take his chance. The
      &lsquo;Congress&rsquo; passed us as we went up the river; she had her studding-sails
      set, and, with the strong tide in her favor, was cutting through the water
      as fast as ever a runaway scoundrel could wish or ask for. Gleeson&rsquo;s
      servant contrived to reach her in time, and got away safe, not improbably
      with a heavy booty, if the truth were known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daly continued to dwell on the theme, repeating circumstantially the whole
      of the examination before the Liverpool Justices, where the depositions of
      the case were taken, and the investigation conducted with strict accuracy;
      but Darcy paid little attention. The sad end of one for whom through years
      long he had entertained feelings of respect and friendship, seemed to
      obliterate all memory of his crime, and he had no other feelings in his
      heart than those of sincere grief for the suicide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is but one circumstance in the whole I cannot understand,&rdquo; said
      Daly, &ldquo;and that is why Gleeson paid off Hickman&rsquo;s bond last week, when he
      had evidently made up his mind to fly,&mdash;seventy thousand was such a
      sum to carry away with him, all safe and sound as he had it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where&rsquo;s the evidence of such a payment?&rdquo; said Darcy, sorrowfully;
      &ldquo;the bond is not to be found, nor is it among the papers discovered at
      Gleeson&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be found yet,&rdquo; said Daly, confidently. &ldquo;That the money was paid I
      have not a particle of doubt on my mind; Freney&rsquo;s information, and the
      memorandum I showed you, are strong in corroborating the fact; old Hickman
      dared not deny it, if the bond never were to turn up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven grant it!&rdquo; said Darcy, fervently; &ldquo;that will at least save the
      abbey, and rescue our old house from the pollution I dreaded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that, however, does not explain the difficulty,&rdquo; said Daly,
      thoughtfully; &ldquo;I wish some shrewder head than mine had the matter before
      him. But now that I have told you so much, let me have some supper, Darcy,
      for we forgot to victual our sloop, and had no sea-store but whiskey on
      either voyage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though this was perfectly true, Daly&rsquo;s proposition was made rather to
      induce the Knight to take some refreshment, which it was so evident he
      needed, than from any personal motive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They carried the second reading by a large majority; I read it in
      Liverpool,&rdquo; said Daly, as the servant laid the table for supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knight nodded an assent, and Daly resumed: &ldquo;I saw also that an address
      was voted by the patriotic members of Daly&rsquo;s to Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly, Esquire,
      M.P., for his manly and independent conduct in the debate, when he taunted
      the Government with their ineffectual attempts at corruption, and spurned
      indignantly every offer of their patronage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the case?&rdquo; said the Knight, smiling faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;All fact; while the mob drew his carriage home, and nearly smoked the
      entire of Merrion Square into blackness with burning tar-barrels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has improved on Johnson&rsquo;s definition, Bagenal, and made patriotism the
      first as well as the last refuge of a scoundrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I looked out in the House that evening, but could not see him, for I
      wanted him to second a motion for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! of what nature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most patriotic one, to this effect: that all bribes to members of
      either House should be in money, that we might have at least the benefit
      of introducing so much capital into Ireland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, Bagenal, how it would spoil old Hickman&rsquo;s market: loans would
      then be had for less than ten per cent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it would, by Jove! That shows the difficulty of legislating for
      conflicting interests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This conversation was destined only to occupy the time the servant was
      engaged about the table, but when he had withdrawn, the Knight and his
      friend at once returned to the eventful theme that engaged all their
      anxieties, and where the altered tones of their voices and eager looks
      betokened the deepest interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been difficult to find two men more generally well informed,
      and less capable of comprehending or unravelling the complicated tissue of
      a business matter. At the same time, by dint of much mutual inquiry and
      discussion, they attained to that first and greatest of discoveries,
      namely, their own insufficiency to conduct the investigation, and the
      urgent necessity of employing some able man of law to go through all
      Gleeson&rsquo;s accounts, and ascertain the real condition of Darcy&rsquo;s fortune.
      With this prudent resolve, they parted: Darcy to his room, where he sat
      with unclosed eyes till morning; while Daly, who had disciplined his
      temperament more rigidly, soon fell fast asleep, and never awoke till
      roused by the voice of his servant Sandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must find out the fellow that brought the note from Freney,&rdquo; said
      Daly, the moment he opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking so,&rdquo; said Sandy, sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d know him again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;d ken his twa eyes amang a thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, set off after breakfast and search for him; you used to
      know where devils of this kind were to be found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I havna quite forgot it yet,&rdquo; replied he, dryly; &ldquo;but it winna do
      to gae there before nightfall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lose no more time than you can help about it,&rdquo; said Daly; &ldquo;bring him here
      if you can find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We have not the necessity, and more certainly it is far from our
      inclination, to dwell upon the accumulated calamities of the Knight, nor
      recount more particularly the sad disclosures which the few succeeding
      days made regarding his fortunes. His own words were correct; he was
      utterly ruined. Every species of iniquity which perfidy could practise
      upon unbounded confidence had been effected. His property subdivided and
      leased at nominal rents, debts long supposed to have been paid yet
      outstanding; mortgages alleged to have been redeemed still impending;
      while of the large sums raised to meet these encumbrances not one shilling
      had been paid by Gleeson, save perhaps the bond for seventy thousand; but
      even of this there was no evidence, except the vague assertion of one
      whose testimony the law would reject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, in brief, were the sad results of that investigation to which the
      Knight&rsquo;s affairs were submitted, nor could all the practised subtlety of
      the lawyer suggest one reasonable chance of extrication from the
      difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend is a ruined man, sir,&rdquo; said he to Daly, as they both arose
      after a seven hours&rsquo; examination of the various documents; &ldquo;there is a
      strong presumption that many of these signatures are forged, and that the
      Knight of Gwynne never even saw the papers; but he appears to have written
      his name so carelessly, and in so many ways, as to have no clear
      recollection of what he did sign, and what he did not. It would be very
      difficult to submit a good case for a jury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That the payment of the seventy thousand had been made he regarded as more
      than doubtful, coupling the fact of Gleeson&rsquo;s immediate flight with the
      temptation of so large a sum, while nothing could be less accurate than
      the robber&rsquo;s testimony. &ldquo;We must watch the enemy closely on this point,&rdquo;
       said he; &ldquo;we must exhibit not the slightest apparent doubt upon it. They
      must not be led to suspect that we have not the bond in our possession.
      This question will admit of a long contest, and does not press like the
      others. As to young Darcy&rsquo;s concurrence in the sale&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that is the great matter in my friend&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be written to at once,&mdash;let him come over here without loss
      of time, and if it can be shown that this signature is a forgery, we might
      make it the ground of a compromise with the O&rsquo;Reillys, who, to obtain a
      good title, would be glad to admit us to liberal terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darcy will never listen to that, depend upon it,&rdquo; said Daly; &ldquo;his
      greatest affliction is for his son&rsquo;s ruin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We &lsquo;ll see, we &lsquo;ll see&mdash;the game shall open its own combinations as
      we go on; for the present, all the task of your friend the Knight is to
      carry a bold face to the world, let no rumor get abroad that matters are
      in their real condition. Our chance of extrication lies in the front we
      can show to the enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are making a heavier demand than you are aware of,&mdash;Darcy
      detests anything like concealment. I don&rsquo;t believe he would practise the
      slightest mystery that would involve insincerity for twelve hours to free
      the whole estate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very honorable indeed; but at this moment we must waive a punctilio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give it that name to him,&mdash;that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Daly, sternly. &ldquo;I
      am as little for subterfuge as any man, and yet I did my best to prevent
      him resigning his seat in the House; this morning he would send a request
      to Lord Castlereagh, begging he might be permitted to accept an
      escheatorship; I need not say how willingly the proposal was accepted, and
      his name will appear in the &lsquo;Gazette&rsquo; to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This conduct, if persisted in, will ruin our case,&rdquo; said the lawyer,
      despondingly. &ldquo;I cannot comprehend his reasons for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are simple enough: his own words were, &lsquo;I can never continue to be a
      member of the legislature when the only privilege it would confer is
      freedom from arrest.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very valuable one at this crisis, if he knew but all,&rdquo; muttered the
      other. &ldquo;You will write to young Darcy at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he has done already, and to Lady Eleanor also; and as he expects me
      at seven, I &lsquo;ll take my leave of you till to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Daly,&rdquo; said the Knight, as his friend entered the drawing-room
      before dinner, &ldquo;how do you like the lawyer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a shrewd fellow, and I suppose, for his calling, an honest one; but
      the habit of making the wrong seem right leads to a very great inclination
      to reverse the theorem, and make the right seem wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks badly of our case, is n&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He &lsquo;d think much better of it, and of us too, I believe, if both were
      worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am just as well pleased that it is not so,&rdquo; said Darcy, smiling; &ldquo;a bad
      case is far more endurable than a bad conscience. But here comes dinner,
      and I have got my appetite back again.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. A GLANCE AT &ldquo;THE FULL MOON.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      To rescue our friend Bagenal Daly from any imputation the circumstance
      might suggest, it is as well to observe here, that when he issued the
      order to his servant to seek out the boy who brought the intelligence of
      Gleeson&rsquo;s flight, he was merely relying on that knowledge of the obscure
      recesses of Old Dublin which Sandy possessed, and not by any means upon a
      distinct acquaintance with gentlemen of the same rank and station as
      Jemmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Daly first took up his residence in the capital, many, many years
      before, he was an object of mob worship. He had every quality necessary
      for such. He was immensely rich, profusely spendthrift, and eccentric to
      an extent that some characterized as insanity. His dress, his equipage,
      his liveries, his whole retinue and style of living were strange and
      unlike other men&rsquo;s, while his habits of life bid utter defiance to every
      ordinance of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of several years&rsquo; foreign travel he had made acquaintances
      the most extraordinary and dissimilar, and many of these were led to visit
      him in his own country. Dublin being less resorted to by strangers than
      most cities, the surprise of its inhabitants was proportionably great as
      they beheld, not only Hungarians and Russian nobles, with gorgeous
      equipages and splendid retinues, driving through the streets, but Turks,
      Armenians, and Greeks, in full costume; and, on one occasion, Daly&rsquo;s
      companion on a public promenade was no less remarkable a person than a
      North American chief, in all the barbaric magnificence of his native
      dress. To obviate the inconvenience of that mob accompaniment such
      spectacles would naturally attract, Daly entered into a compact with the
      leaders of the varions sets or parties of low Dublin, by which, on payment
      of a certain sum, he was guaranteed in the enjoyment of appearing in
      public without a following of several hundred ragged wretches in full cry
      after him. Nothing could be more honorable and fair than the conduct of
      both parties in this singular treaty; the subsidy was regularly paid
      through the hands of Sandy M&rsquo;Grane, while the subsidized literally
      observed every article of the contract, and not only avoided any
      molestation on their own parts, but were a formidable protective force in
      the event of any annoyance from others of a superior rank in society.

      The hawkers of the various newspapers were the deputies with whom Sandy
      negotiated this treaty, they being recognized as the legitimate
      interpreters of mob opinion through the capital; men who combined an
      insight into local grievances with a corresponding knowledge of general
      politics; and certain it is, their sway must have been both respected and
      well protected, for a single transgression of the compact with Daly never
      occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bagenal Daly troubled his head very little in the matter, it is true; for
      his own sake he would never have thought of such a bargain, but he
      detested the thought of foreigners carrying away with them from Ireland
      any unpleasant memories of mob outrage or insult; and desired that the
      only remembrance they should preserve of his native country should be of
      its cordial and hospitable reception. A great many years had now elapsed
      since these pleasant times, and Daly&rsquo;s name was scarcely more than a
      tradition among those who now lounged in rags and idleness through the
      capital,&mdash;a fact of which he could have had little doubt himself, if
      he had reflected on that crowd which followed his own steps but a few days
      before. Of this circumstance, however, he took little or no notice, and
      gave his orders to Sandy with the same conscious power he had wielded
      nearly fifty years back.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small public-house, called the Moon, in Duck Alley, a narrow lane off
      the Cross Poddle, was the resort of this Rump Parliament, and thither
      Sandy betook himself on a Saturday evening, the usual night of meeting,
      as, there being no issue of newspapers the next morning, nothing
      interfered with a prolonged conviviality. Often and often had he taken the
      same journey at the same hour; but now, such is the effect of a long
      interval of years, the way seemed narrower and more crooked than ever,
      while as he went not one familiar face welcomed him as he passed; nor
      could he recognize, as of yore, his acquaintances amid the various
      disguises of black eyes and smashed noses, which were frequent on every
      side. It was the hour when crime and guilt, drunken rage and grief,
      mingled together their fearful agencies; and every street and alley was
      crowded by half-naked wretches quarrelling and singing: some screaming in
      accents of heartbroken anguish; others shouting their blasphemies with
      voices hoarse from passion; age and infancy, manhood in its prime, the
      mother and the young girl, were all there, reeling from drunkenness, or
      faint from famine; some struggling in deadly conflict, others bathing the
      lips and temples of ebbing life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this human hell Sandy wended his way, occasionally followed by the
      taunting ribaldry of such as remarked him: such testimonies were very
      unlike his former welcomes in these regions; but for this honest Sandy
      cared little; his real regret was to see so much more evidence of
      depravity and misery than before. Drunkenness and its attendant vices were
      no new evils, it is true; but he thought all these were fearfully
      aggravated by what he now witnessed: loud and violent denunciations
      against every rank above their own, imprecations on the Parliament and the
      gentry that &ldquo;sowld Ireland:&rdquo; as if any political perfidy could be the
      origin of their own degraded and revolting condition! Such is, however,
      the very essence of that spirit that germinates amid destitution and
      crime, and it is a dangerous social crisis when the masses begin to
      attribute their own demoralization to the vices of their betters. It well
      behooves those in high places to make their actions and opinions conform
      to their great destinies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sandy&rsquo;s Northern blood revolted at these brutal excesses, and the savage
      menaces he heard on every side; but perhaps his susceptibilities were more
      outraged by one trail of popular injustice than all the rest, and that was
      to hear Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly extolled by the mob for his patriotic rejection
      of bribery, while the Knight of Gwynne was held up to execration by every
      epithet of infamy; ribald jests and low ballads conveying the theme of
      attack upon his spotless character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The street lyrics of the day were divided in interest between the late
      rebellion and the act of Union; the former being, however, the favorite
      theme, from a species of irony peculiar to this class of poetry, in which
      certain living characters were held up to derision or execration. The
      chief chorist appeared to be a fiend-like old woman, with one eye, and a
      voice like a cracked bassoon: she was dressed in a cast-off soldier&rsquo;s coat
      and a man&rsquo;s hat, and neither from face nor costume had few feminine
      traits. This fair personage, known by the name of Rhoudlum, was, on her
      appearing, closely followed by a mob of admiring amateurs, who seemed to
      form both her body-guard and her chorus. When Sandy found himself fast
      wedged up in this procession, the enthusiasm was at its height, in honor
      of an elegant new ballad called &ldquo;The Two Majors.&rdquo; The air, should our
      reader be musically given, was the well-known one, &ldquo;There was a Miller had
      Three Sons:&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Says Major Sirr to Major Swan,
     You have two rebels, give me one;
     They pay the same for one as two,
     I &lsquo;ll get five pounds, and I &lsquo;ll share with you.
     Toi! loi! loi! lay.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way the blackguards sowld yer blood, boys!&rdquo; said the hag, in
      recitative; &ldquo;pitch caps, the ridin&rsquo; house, and the gallows was iligant
      tratement for wearin&rsquo; the green.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Rhoudlum, go on wid the song,&rdquo; chimed in her followers, who cared
      more for the original text than prose vulgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arn&rsquo;t I goin&rsquo; on wid it?&rdquo; said the hag, as fire flashed in her eye; &ldquo;is
      it the likes of you is to tache me how to modulate a strain?&rdquo; And she
      resumed:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Says Major Swan to Major Sirr,
     One man&rsquo;s a woman! ye may take her.
     &lsquo;T is little we gets for them at all&mdash;
     Oh! the curse of Cromwell be an ye all!
     Toi! loi! loll lay.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The grand Demosthenic abruptness of the last line was the signal for an
      applauding burst of voices, whose sincerity it would be unfair to
      question.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you pushin&rsquo; to! bad scran to ye! ye ugly varmint!&rdquo; said the
      lady, as Sandy endeavored to force his passage through the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurroo! by the mortial, it&rsquo;s Daly&rsquo;s man!&rdquo; screamed she, in transport, as
      the accidental light of a window showed Sandy&rsquo;s features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few, if any, of those around had ever seen him; but his name and his
      master&rsquo;s were among the favored traditions of the place, and however
      unwilling to acknowledge the acquaintance, Sandy had no help for it but to
      exchange greetings and ask the way to &ldquo;the Moon,&rdquo; which he found he had
      forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is fornint ye, Mr. M&rsquo;Granes,&rdquo; said the lady, in the most dulcet
      tones; &ldquo;and if it&rsquo;s thinking of trating me ye are, &lsquo;t is a &lsquo;crapper&rsquo; in a
      pint of porter I &lsquo;d take; nothing stronger would sit on my heart now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye shall hae it,&rdquo; said Sandy; &ldquo;but come into the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I darn&rsquo;t do it, sir; the committee is sittin&rsquo;&mdash;don&rsquo;t ye see,
      besides, the moon lookin&rsquo; at you?&rdquo; And she pointed to a rude
      representation of a crescent moon, formed by a kind of transparency in the
      middle of a large window, a signal which Sandy well knew portended that
      the council were assembled within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha&rsquo;s the man, noo?&rdquo; said Sandy, with one foot on the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ould stock still, darlint,&rdquo; said Rhoudlum,&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t ye know his
      voice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Paul Donellan,&mdash;I ken him noo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be my conscience! there&rsquo;s no mistake. Ye can hear his screech from the
      Poddle to the Pigeon House when the wind&rsquo;s fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sandy put a shilling into the hag&rsquo;s hand, and, without waiting for further
      parley, entered the little dark hall, and turning a corner he well
      remembered, pressed a button and opened the door into the room where the
      party were assembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the blazes are you? What brings you here?&rdquo; burst from a score of rude
      voices together, while every hand grasped some projectile to hurl at the
      devoted intruder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Paul Donellan who I am, and he&rsquo;ll tell ye,&rdquo; said Sandy, sternly,
      while, with a bold contempt for the hostile demonstrations, he walked
      straight up to the head of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recognition on which he reckoned so confidently was not forthcoming,
      for the old decrepit creature who, cowering beneath the wig of some
      defunct chancellor, presided, stared at him with eyes bleared with age and
      intemperance, but seemed unable to detect him as an acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Paul does n&rsquo;t know him!&rdquo; said half-a-dozen together, as, in
      passionate indignation, they arose to resent the intrusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may remember this better,&rdquo; said Sandy, as, seizing a full bumper of
      whiskey from the board, he threw it into the lamp beneath the
      transparency, and in a moment the moon flashed forth, and displayed its
      face at the full. The spell was magical, and a burst of savage welcome
      broke from every mouth, while Donellan, as if recalled to consciousness,
      put his hand trumpet-fashion to his lips, and gave a shout that made the
      very glasses ring upon the board. Place was now made for Sandy at the
      table, and a wooden vessel called &ldquo;a noggin&rdquo; set before him, whose
      contents he speedily tested by a long draught.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may as weel tell you,&rdquo; said Sandy, &ldquo;that I am Bagenal Daly&rsquo;s man. I
      mind the time it wad na hae been needful to say so much,&mdash;my master&rsquo;s
      picture used to hang upon that wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had Sandy proclaimed himself the Prince of Wales the announcement could
      not have met with more honor, and many a coarse and rugged grasp of the
      hand attested the pleasure his presence there afforded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have the picture still,&rdquo; said a young fellow, whose frank,
      good-humored face contrasted strongly with many of those around him; &ldquo;but
      that old divil, Paul, always told us it was a likeness of himself when he
      was young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound the scoundrel!&rdquo; said Sandy, indignantly; &ldquo;he was no mair like my
      maister than a Dutch skipper is like a chief of the Delawares. Has the
      creature lost his senses a&rsquo;togither?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no manner of manes. He wakes up every now and then wid a speech, or a
      bit of poethry, or a sentiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;or if a couple came in to be married, see how the old
      chap&rsquo;s eyes would brighten, and how he would turn the other side of his
      wig round before you could say &lsquo;Jack Robinson.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was literally correct, and was the simple manouvre by which Holy Paul
      converted himself into a clerical character, the back of his wig being cut
      in horse-shoe fashion, in rude imitation of that worn by several of the
      bishops.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watch him now&mdash;watch him now!&rdquo; said one in Sandy&rsquo;s ears; and the old
      fellow passed his hand across his eyes as if to dispel some painful
      thought, while his careworn features were lit up with a momentary flash of
      sardonic drollery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your health, sir,&rdquo; said he to Sandy; &ldquo;or, as Terence has it, &lsquo;Hic tibi,
      Dave&rsquo;&mdash;here &lsquo;s to you, Davy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A toast, Paul! a toast! Something agin the Union,&mdash;something agin
      old Darcy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fill up, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Paul, in a clear and distinct voice. &ldquo;I beg to
      propose a sentiment which you will drink with a bumper. Are you ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready!&rdquo; screamed all together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, then,&mdash;repeat after me:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Whether he&rsquo;s out, or whether he&rsquo;s in,
     It does n&rsquo;t signify one pin;
     Here&rsquo;s every curse of every sin
     On Maurice Darcy, Knight of Gwynne.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; shouted Sandy, as he drew a double-barrelled pistol from his
      bosom. &ldquo;By the saul o&rsquo; my body the man that drinks that toast shall hae
      mair in his waim than hot water and whiskey. Maurice Darcy is my maister&rsquo;s
      friend, and a better gentleman never stepped in leather: who dar say no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we to drink it, Paul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I live by drink,&rdquo; cried Paul, stretching out both hands, &ldquo;this is my
      <i>alter ego</i>, my duplicate self, Sanders M&rsquo;Grane&rsquo;s, &lsquo;revisiting the
      glimpses of the moon,&rsquo; <i>post totidem annos!</i>&rdquo; And a cordial embrace
      now followed, which at once dispelled the threatened storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. M&rsquo;Grane&rsquo;s health in three times three, gentlemen;&rdquo; and, rising, Paul
      gave the signal for each cheer as he alone could give it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sandy had now time to throw a glance around the table, where, however, not
      one familiar face met his own; that they were of the same calling and
      order as his quondam associates in the same place he could have little
      doubt, even had that fact not been proclaimed by the names of various
      popular journals affixed to their hats, and by whose titles they were
      themselves addressed. The conversation, too, had the same sprinkling of
      politics, town gossip, and late calamities he well remembered of yore,
      interspersed with lively commentaries on public men which, if printed,
      would have been suggestive of libel.
    </p>

    <p>
      The new guest soon made himself free of the guild by a proposal to treat
      the company, on the condition that he might be permitted to have five
      minutes&rsquo; conversation with their president in an adjoining room. He might
      have asked much more in requital for his liberality, and without a
      moment&rsquo;s delay, or even apprising Paul of what was intended, the &ldquo;Dublin
      Journal&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Free Press&rdquo; took him boldly between them and carried him
      into a closet off the room where the carouse was held.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you are at,&rdquo; said Paul, as soon as the door closed. &ldquo;Daly
      wants a rising of the Liberty boys for the next debate,&mdash;don&rsquo;t deny
      it, it&rsquo;s no use. Well, now, listen, and don&rsquo;t interrupt me. Tom Conolly
      came down from the Castle yesterday and offered me five pounds for a good
      mob to rack a house, and two-ten if they&rsquo;d draw Lord Clare home; but I
      refused,&mdash;I did, on the virtue of my oath. There&rsquo;s patriotism for ye!&mdash;yer
      soul, where &lsquo;s the man wid only one shirt and a supplement to his back
      would do the same?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;re wrang,&mdash;we dinna want them devils at a&rsquo;; it &lsquo;s a sma&rsquo; matter
      of inquiry I cam about. Ye ken Freney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it the Captain? Whew!&rdquo; said Paul, with a long whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no him,&rdquo; resumed Sandy, &ldquo;but a wee bit of a callant they ca&rsquo; Jamie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jemmy the diver,&mdash;the divil&rsquo;s own grandson, that he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can I find him?&rdquo; said Sandy, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a bit, and you&rsquo;ll be sure to see him at home in his lodgings in
      Newgate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must find him out at once; put me on his track, and I &lsquo;ll gie a goold
      guinea in yer hand, mon. I mean the young rascal no harm; it&rsquo;s a question
      I want him to answer me, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll do my best to find him for you, but I must send down to the
      country. I&rsquo;ll have to get a man to go beyond Kilcullen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We &lsquo;ll pay any expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure I know that.&rdquo; And here Paul began a calculation to himself of
      distances and charges only audible to Sandy&rsquo;s ears at intervals: &ldquo;Two and
      four, and six, with a glass of punch at Naas&mdash;half an hour at Tims&rsquo;&mdash;the
      coach at Athy&mdash;ay, that will do it. Have ye the likes of a pair of
      ould boots or shoes? I &lsquo;ve nothing but them, and the soles is made out of
      two pamphlets of Roger Connor&rsquo;s, and them&rsquo;s the driest things I could
      get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gie ye a new pair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;re the son of Fingal of the Hills, divil a less. And now if ye had a
      cast-off waistcoat&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care for the color&mdash;orange or green,
      blue or yellow, <i>Tros Tyriusve mihiy</i> as we said in Trinity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye shall hae a coat to cover your old bones. But let us hae nae mair o&rsquo;
      this&mdash;when may I expect to see the boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The evening after next, at eight o&rsquo;clock, at the corner of Essex Bridge,
      Capel Street&mdash;&lsquo;on the Rialto&rsquo;&mdash;eh? that&rsquo;s the cue. And now let
      us join the revellers&mdash;<i>per Jove</i>, but I&rsquo;m dry.&rdquo; And so saying,
      the miserable old creature broke from Sandy, and, assisted by the wall,
      tottered back to the room to his drunken companions, where his voice was
      soon heard high above the discord and din around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet this man, so debased and degraded, had been once a scholar of the
      University, and carried off its prizes from men whose names stood high
      among the great and valued of the land.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. BAGENAL DALY&rsquo;S COUNSELS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Every hour seemed to complicate the Knight of Gwynne&rsquo;s difficulties, and
      to increase that intricacy by which he already was so much embarrassed.
      The forms of law, never grateful to him, became now perfectly odious,
      obscuring instead of explaining the questions on which he desired
      information. He hated, besides, the small and narrow expedients so
      constantly suggested in cases where his own sense of right convinced him
      of the justice of his cause, nor could he listen with common patience to
      the detail of all those legal subtleties by which an adverse claim might
      be, if not resisted, at least protracted indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      His presence, far from affording any assistance, was, therefore, only an
      embarrassment both to Daly and the lawyer, and they heard with unmixed
      satisfaction of his determination to hasten down to the West, and
      communicate more freely with his family, for as yet his letter to Lady
      Eleanor, far from disclosing the impending ruin, merely mentioned
      Gleeson&rsquo;s flight as a disastrous event in the life of a man esteemed and
      respected, and adverting but slightly to his own difficulties in
      consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must leave the abbey, Bagenal, I foresee that,&rdquo; said Darcy, as he took
      his friend aside a few minutes before starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daly made no reply, for already his own convictions pointed the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not live there with crippled means and broken fortune; &lsquo;twould
      kill me in a month, by Jove, to see the poor fellows wandering about idle
      and unemployed, the stables nailed up, the avenue grass-grown, and not
      hear the cry of a hound when I crossed the courtyard. But what is to be
      done? Humbled as I am, I cannot think of letting it to some Hickman
      O&rsquo;Reilly or other, some vulgar upstart, feasting his low companions in
      those old halls, or plotting our utter ruin at our own hearthstone; could
      we not make some other arrangement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought of one,&rdquo; said Daly, calmly; &ldquo;my only fear is how to ask
      Lady Eleanor&rsquo;s concurrence to a plan which must necessarily press most
      heavily on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Darcy, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, your inclination would be, for a time at least, perfect
      seclusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, above all and everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, what say you to taking up your abode in a little cottage of
      mine on the Antrim coast? It is a wild and lonely spot, it&rsquo;s true, but you
      may live there without attracting notice or observation. I see you are
      surprised at my having such a possession. I believe I never told you,
      Darcy, that I bought Sandy&rsquo;s cabin from him the day he entered my service,
      and fitted it up, and intended it as an asylum for the poor fellow if he
      should grow weary of my fortunes, or happily survive me. By degrees, I
      have added a room here and a closet there, till it has grown into a
      dwelling that any one, as fond of salmon-fishing as you and I were, would
      not despise; come, will you have it?&rdquo; Darcy grasped his friend&rsquo;s hand
      without speaking, and Daly went on: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right; I&rsquo;ll give orders to
      have everything in readiness at once; I&rsquo;ll go down, too, and induct you.
      Ay, Darcy, and if the fellows could take a peep at us over our lobster and
      a glass of Isla whiskey, they &lsquo;d stare to think those two jovial old
      fellows, so merry and contented, started, the day they came of age, with
      the two best estates in Ireland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had not brought ruin on others, Bagenal&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more of that, Darcy; the most scandal-loving gossip of the Club will
      never impute, for he dare not, more than carelessness to your conduct, and
      I promise you, if you &lsquo;ll only fall back on a good conscience, you &lsquo;ll not
      be unhappy under the thatched roof of my poor shieling. My sincerest
      regards to Lady Eleanor and Helen. I see there is a crowd collecting at
      the sight of the four posters, so don&rsquo;t delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darcy could do no more than squeeze the cordial hand that held his own,
      and, passing hastily out, he stepped into the travelling-carriage at the
      door, not unobserved, indeed, for about a hundred ragged creatures had now
      assembled, who saluted his appearance with groans and hisses, accompanied
      with ruffianly taunts about bribery and corruption; while one, more daring
      than the rest, mounted on the step, and with his face to the window, cried
      out: &ldquo;My Lord, my Lord, won&rsquo;t you give us a trifle to drown your new
      coronet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were scarcely out, when, seizing him by the neck with one hand,
      and taking a leg in the other, Daly hurled the fellow into the middle of
      the mob, who, such is their consistency, laughed loud and heartily at the
      fellow&rsquo;s misfortunes; meanwhile, the postilions plied whip and spur, and
      ere the laughter had subsided, the carriage was out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a gentleman in the drawing-room wishes to speak to you, sir,&rdquo;
       said a servant to Daly, who had just sat down to a conference with the
      lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Present my respectful compliments, and say that I am engaged on most
      important and pressing business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you not better ask his name?&rdquo; said the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, there is nothing but interruptions here; at one moment it is
      Heffernan, with a polite message from Lord Castlereagh; then some one from
      the Club, to know if I have any objection to waive a standing order, and
      have that young O&rsquo;Reilly balloted for once more; and here was George
      Falkner himself a while ago, asking if the Knight had really taken office,
      with a seat in the Cabinet. I said it was perfectly correct, and that he
      was at liberty to state it in his paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and that he might add that I myself had refused the see of Llandaff,
      preferring the command of the West India Squadron. But, what&rsquo;s this? What
      do you want now, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman upstairs, sir, insists on my presenting his card.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed!&mdash;Captain Forester!&mdash;I &lsquo;ll see him at once.&rdquo; And, so
      saying, Daly hastened upstairs to the drawing-room, where the young
      officer awaited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daly was not in a mood to scrutinize very closely the appearance of his
      visitor, but he could not fail to feel struck at the alteration in his
      looks since last they met; his features were paler and marked by sorrow,
      so much so that Daly&rsquo;s first question was, &ldquo;Have you been ill?&rdquo; and as
      Forester answered in the negative, the old man fixed his eyes steadily on
      him, and said, &ldquo;You have heard of our misfortune, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Misfortune! no. What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daly hesitated, uncertain how to reply, whether to leave to time and some
      other channel to announce the Knight&rsquo;s ruin, or at once communicate it
      with his own lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is the better way,&rdquo; said he, half aloud, while, taking Forester&rsquo;s
      hand, he led him over to a sofa, and pressed him down beside him. &ldquo;I
      seldom have made an error in guessing a man&rsquo;s character, throughout a long
      and somewhat remarkable life. I think I am safe in saying that you feel a
      warm interest in my friend Darcy&rsquo;s family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do me but justice; gratitude alone, if I had no stronger motive,
      secures them every good wish of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have stronger motives, young man,&rdquo; said Daly, looking at him with
      a piercing glance; &ldquo;if you had not, I &lsquo;d think but meanly of you, nor did
      I want that blush to tell me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forester looked down in confusion. The abruptness of the address so
      completely unmanned him that he could make no answer. While Daly went on:
      &ldquo;I force no confidences, young man, nor have I any right to ask them;
      enough for my present purpose that I know you care deeply for this family;
      now, sir, but a week back the ambition to be allied with them had
      satisfied the proudest wish of the proudest house&mdash;to-day they are
      ruined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Overwhelmed with surprise and sorrow, Forester sat silently, while Daly
      rapidly, but circumstantially, narrated the story of the Knight&rsquo;s
      calamity, and the total wreck of his once princely fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Daly, as with flashing eyes he arose and uttered aloud,&mdash;&ldquo;yes,
      the broad acres won by many a valiant deed, the lands which his ancestors
      watered with their blood, lost forever; not by great crimes, not forfeited
      by any bold but luckless venture, for there is something glorious in that,&mdash;but
      stolen, filched away by theft. By Heaven! our laws and liberties do but
      hedge round crime with so many defences that honesty has nothing left but
      to stand shivering outside. Better were the days when the strong hand
      avenged the deep wrong, or, if the courage were weak, there was the Throne
      to appeal to against oppression. Forester, I see how this news afflicts
      you; I judged you too well to think that your own dashed hopes entered
      into your sorrow. No, no, I know you better. But come, we have other
      duties than to mourn over the past. Has Lord Castlereagh received Darcy&rsquo;s
      note, resigning his seat in Parliament?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has; a new writ is preparing for Mayo.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sharp practice; I think I can
      detect the fair round hand of Mr. Heffernan there,&mdash;no matter, a few
      days more and the world will know all; ay, the world, so full of honorable
      sentiments and noble aspirations, will smile and jest on Darcy&rsquo;s ruin,
      that they may with better grace taunt the vulgar assumption of Hickman
      O&rsquo;Reilly. I know it well,&mdash;some would say I bought the knowledge
      dearly. When I set out in life, my fortune was nearly equal to the
      Knight&rsquo;s, my ideas of living and expenditure based on the same views as
      his own,&mdash;that same barbaric taste for profusion which has been
      transmitted to us from father to son. Ay, we retained everything of
      feudalism save its chivalry! Well, I never knew a day nor an hour of
      independence till the last acre of that great estate was sold, and gone
      from me forever. Fawning flattery, intrigue, and trickery beset me
      wherever I went; ruined gamblers, match-making mothers, bankrupt
      speculators, plotting political adventurers, dogged me at every step; nor
      could I break through the trammels by which they fettered me, except at
      the price of my ruin; when there was no longer a stake to play for, they
      left the table. Poor Darcy, however, is not a lonely stem, like me, riven
      and lightning-struck; he has a wife and children; but for that, I would
      not fear to grasp his stout hand and say, &lsquo;Come on to fortune.&rsquo; Poor
      Maurice, whose heart could never stand the slightest wrong done the
      humblest cottier on his land, how will he bear up now? Forester, you can
      do me a great service. Could you obtain leave for a day or two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Command me how and in what way you please,&rdquo; said the youth, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand that proffer, and accept it as freely as it is given.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, you are mistaken,&rdquo; said Forester, faltering. &ldquo;I will be candid with
      you; you have a right to all my confidence, for you have trusted in me.
      Your suspicions are only correct in part; my affection is indeed engaged,
      but I have received none in return: Miss Darcy has rejected me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not without hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without the slightest hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven, it is the only gleam of light in all the gloomy business,&rdquo;
       said Daly, energetically; &ldquo;had Helen&rsquo;s love been yours, this calamity had
      been ten thousand times worse. Nay, nay, this is not the sentiment of cold
      and selfish old age; you wrong me, Forester, but the hour is come when
      every feeling within that noble girl&rsquo;s heart is due to those who have
      loved and cherished her from childhood. Now is the time to repay the
      watchful care of infancy, and recompense the anxious fears that spring
      from parental affection; not a sentiment, not a thought, should be turned
      from that channel now. It would be treason to win one smile, one passing
      look of kind meaning from those eyes, every beam of which is claimed by
      &lsquo;Home.&rsquo; Helen is equal to her destiny,&mdash;that I know well; and you, if
      you would strive to be worthy of her, do not endeavor to make her falter
      in her duty. Trust me, there is but one road to a heart like hers,&mdash;the
      path of high and honorable ambition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Forester, in a sad and humble voice,&mdash;&ldquo;you are
      right; I offered her a heart before it was worthy of her acceptance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That avowal is the first step towards rendering it such one day,&rdquo; said
      Daly, grasping his hand in both his own. &ldquo;Now to my request: you can
      obtain this leave, can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; how can I make it of any service to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply thus: I have offered, and Darcy has accepted, a humble cottage on
      the northern coast, as a present asylum for the family. The remote and
      secluded nature of the place will at least withdraw them from the
      impertinence of curiosity, or the greater impertinence of vulgar sympathy.
      A maiden sister of mine is the present occupant, and I wish to communicate
      the intelligence to her, that she may make any preparations which may be
      necessary for their coming, and also provide herself with some other
      shelter. Maria is as great a Bedouin as myself, and with as strong a taste
      for vagabondage; she &lsquo;ll have no difficulty in housing herself, that&rsquo;s
      certain. The only puzzle is how to apprise her of the intended change:
      there is not a post-office within eight or ten miles of the place, nor, if
      there were, would she think of sending to look for a letter; there &lsquo;s
      nothing for it but a special envoy: will you be the man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most willingly; only give me the route, and my instructions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have both. Come and dine with me here at five&mdash;order
      horses to your carriage for eight o&rsquo;clock, and I&rsquo;ll take care of the
      rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said Forester; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lose no time in getting ready for the road&mdash;the
      first thing is my leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a difficulty there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There shall be none,&rdquo; said Forester, hurriedly, as he seized his hat,
      and, bidding Daly good-bye, hastened downstairs and into the street. &ldquo;They
      &lsquo;ll refuse me, I know that,&rdquo; muttered he, as he went along; &ldquo;and if they
      do, I&rsquo;ll pitch up the appointment on the spot; this slight service over,
      I&rsquo;m ready to join my regiment.&rdquo; And so saying, he turned his steps towards
      the Castle, resolved on the course to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Daly, after a brief consultation with the lawyer, sat down to
      write to his sister. Simple and easy as the act is to many&mdash;far too
      much so, as most men&rsquo;s correspondence would testify&mdash;letter-writing,
      to some people, is an affair of no common difficulty. Perhaps every one in
      this world has some stumbling-block of this kind ever before him: some men
      cannot learn chess, some never can be taught to ride, others, if they were
      to get the world for it, could not carve a hare. It would be unfair to
      quote newly introduced difficulties, such as how to bray in the House of
      Commons, the back step in the polka, and so on; the original evils are
      enough for our illustration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bagenal Daly&rsquo;s literary difficulties were manifold; he was a discursive
      thinker, passionate and vehement whenever the occasion prompted, and as
      unable to control such influences when writing as speaking; and, with very
      liberal ideas on the score of spelling, he wrote a hand which, if only
      examined upside down, might have passed for Hebrew, with an undue
      proportion of points; besides these defects, he entertained a thorough
      contempt for all writing as an exponent of men&rsquo;s sentiments. His opinion
      was, that speech was the great prerogative of living men, all other modes
      of expression being feeble and miserable expedients; and, to do him
      justice, he conformed, as far as in him lay, to his own theory, and made
      his writing as like his speaking as could be. Brevity was the great
      quality he studied, and for this reason we venture to present the epistle
      to our readers:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Molly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The bill is carried&mdash;or, what comes to the same, the third reading
      comes on next Tuesday, and they &lsquo;ll have a majority&mdash;d&mdash;&mdash;n
      their majority, I forget the number. I was told that bribes were plenty as
      blackberries. I wish they &lsquo;d leave as many stains after them. They offered
      me nothing&mdash;they were right there. There is a kind of bottle-nosed
      whale the Indians never harpoon; they call him &ldquo;Hik-na-critchka,&rdquo;&mdash;more
      bone than blubber. Darcy might have been an Earl, or a Marquis, or a Duke,
      perhaps; they wanted one gentleman so much, they &lsquo;d have bid high for him.
      Poor fellow, he is ruined now! that scoundrel Gleeson has run away with
      everything, forged, falsified, and thieved to any extent. Your unlucky
      four thousand, of course, is gone to the devil with the rest. I &lsquo;m sick of
      cant. People talk of badgers and such like, and yet no one says a word
      about exterminating attorneys! The rascal jumped over in the Channel, and
      was drowned&mdash;the shark got a bitter pill that swallowed him. I have
      told Darcy he might have &ldquo;the Corvy;&rdquo; you can easily find a wigwam down
      the coast. Forester, who brings this, knows all. We must all economize, I
      suppose. I &lsquo;ve given up Maccabaw already, and taken to Blackguard, in
      compliment to the Secretary. I must sell or shoot old Drummer at last, he
      can&rsquo;t draw his breath, and won&rsquo;t draw the gig. I only remain here till the
      House is up, when I must be up too and stirring&mdash;there is a
      confounded bond&mdash;no matter, more at another time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      Bagenal Daly.
    </p>
    <p>
      St. George is to be the Chief Baron&mdash;an improvement of the allegory,
      &ldquo;Justice will be deaf as well as blind.&rdquo; Devil take them all!
    </p>
    <p>
      The chorus of a Greek play, so seemingly abstruse and incoherent to our
      present thinking, was, we are told, made easily comprehensible by the aid
      of gesture and pantomime; and in the same way, by supplying the fancied
      accompaniment of her brother&rsquo;s voice and action, Miss Daly was enabled to
      read and understand this strange epistle. Bagenal gave himself little
      trouble in examining how far it conveyed his meaning; but, like a careless
      traveller who huddles his clothes into his portmanteau, and is only
      anxious to make the lock meet, his greatest care was to fold up the
      document and inclose it within an envelope; that done, he hoped it was all
      right,&mdash;in any case, his functions were concluded regarding it, for,
      as he muttered to himself, he only contracted to write, not to read, his
      own letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forester was punctual to the hour appointed; and if not really less
      depressed than before, the stimulating sense of having a service to
      perform made him seem less so. His self-esteem was flattered, too, by his
      own bold line of acting, for he had just resigned his appointment on the
      Staff, his application for leave having been unsuccessful. The fact that
      his rash conduct might involve him in trouble or difficulty was not
      without its own sense of pleasure, for, so is it in all rebellion, the
      great prompter is personal pride. He would gladly have told Daly what had
      happened; but a delicate fear of increasing the apparent load of
      obligation prevented him, and he consequently confined his remarks on the
      matter to bis being free, and at liberty to go wherever his friend
      pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, then,&rdquo; said Daly, leading him across the room to a table, on which
      a large map of Ireland lay open, &ldquo;I have marked your route the entire way.
      Follow that dark line with your eye northwards to Coleraine,&mdash;so far
      you can travel with your carriage and post-horses; how to cross this bit
      of desert here I must leave to yourself: there may be a road for a wheeled
      carriage or not, in my day there was none; that is, however, a good many
      years back; the point to strive for should be somewhere hereabouts. This
      is Dunluce Castle&mdash;well, if I remember aright, the spot is here: you
      must ask for &lsquo;the Corvy,&rsquo;&mdash;the fishermen all know the cabin by that
      name; it was originally built out of the wreck of a French vessel that was
      lost there, and the word Corvy is a Northern version of Corvette. Once
      there,&mdash;and I know you &lsquo;ll not find any difficulty in reaching it,&mdash;my
      sister will be glad to receive you; I need not say the accommodation does
      not rival Gwynne Abbey, no more than poor Molly does Helen Darcy; you will
      be right welcome, however,&mdash;so much I can pledge myself, not the less
      so that your journey was undertaken from a motive of true kindness. I
      don&rsquo;t well know how much or how little I have said in that letter; you can
      explain all I may have omitted,&mdash;the chief thing is to get the cabin
      ready for the Darcys as soon as may be. Give her this pocket-book,&mdash;I
      was too much hurried to-day to transact business at the bank; but the
      north road is a safe one, and you &lsquo;ll not incur any risk. And now one
      glass to the success of the enterprise, and I &lsquo;ll not detain you longer; I
      &lsquo;ll give you old Martin&rsquo;s toast:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;May better days soon be our lot,
     Or better courage, if we have them not.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Forester pledged the sentiment in a bumper, and they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good stuff in that young fellow,&rdquo; muttered Daly, as he looked after him;
      &ldquo;I wish he had some Irish blood, though; these Saxons require a deal of
      the hammer to warm them, and never come to a white heat after all.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXVI. &ldquo;THE CORVY.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      If the painter&rsquo;s license enables him to arrange the elements of scenery
      into new combinations, disposing and grouping anew, as taste or fancy may
      dictate, the novelist enjoys the lesser privilege of conveying his reader
      at will from place to place, and thus, by varying the point of view,
      procuring new aspects to his picture; less in virtue of this privilege
      than from sheer necessity, we will now ask our readers to accompany us on
      our journey northward.

      Whether it be the necessary condition of that profusion of nature&rsquo;s gifts,
      so evident in certain places, or a mere accident, certain it is there is
      scarcely any one spot remarkable for great picturesque beauty to arrive at
      which some bleak and uninteresting tract must not be traversed. To this
      rule, if it be such, the northern coast of Ireland offers no exception.
    </p>
    <p>
      The country, as you approach &ldquo;the Causeway,&rdquo; has an aspect of dreary
      desolation that only needs the leaden sky and the drifting storm of winter
      to make it the most melancholy of all landscapes. A slightly undulating
      surface extends for miles on every side, scarcely a house to be seen, and
      save where the dip of the ground affords shelter, not a tree of any kind.
      A small isolated spot of oats, green even in the late autumn, is here and
      there to be descried, or a flock of black sheep wandering half wild o&rsquo;er
      these savage wastes; vast masses of cloud, dark and lowering as rain and
      thunder can make them, hang gloomily overhead, for the tableland is still
      a lofty one, and the horizon is formed by the edge of those giant cliffs
      that stand the barriers of the western ocean, and against whose rocky
      sides the waves beat with the booming of distant artillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in one of those natural hollows of the soil, whose frequency seems
      to acknowledge a diluvian origin, that the little cottage which Sandy once
      owned stood. Sheltered on the south and east by rising banks, it was open
      on the other sides, and afforded a view seaward which extended from the
      rocky promontory of Port Rush to the great bluff of Fairhead, whose summit
      is nigh one thousand seven hundred feet above the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps in all the sea-board of the empire, nothing of the same extent can
      vie in awful sublimity with this iron-bound coast. Gigantic cliffs of four
      and five hundred feet, straight as a wall, are seen perforated beneath by
      lofty tunnels, through which the wild waters plunge madly. Fragments of
      basalt, large enough to be called islands, are studded along the shore,
      the outlines fanciful and strange as beating waves and winds can make
      them, while, here and there, in some deep-creviced bay, the water flows in
      with long and measured sweep, and, at each moment retiring, leaves a trace
      upon the strand, fleeting as the blush upon the cheek of beauty; and here
      a little group of fisher children may be seen at play, while the nets are
      drying on the beach, the only sight or sound of human life, save that dark
      moving speck, alternately seen as the great waves roll on, be such, and,
      while tossing to and fro, seems by some charmed influence fettered to the
      spot. Yes, it is a fishing-boat that has ventured out at the half ebb,
      with the wind off shore,&mdash;hazardous exploit, that only poverty
      suggests the courage to encounter!
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of one of these little natural bays stood &ldquo;the Corvy;&rdquo; and the
      situation might have been chosen by a painter, for, while combining every
      grand feature of the nearer landscape, the Scottish coast and even Staffa
      might be seen of a clear evening; while westward, the rich sunsets were
      descried in all their golden glory, tipping the rolling waves with
      freckled lustre, and throwing a haze of violet-colored light over the
      white rocks. And who is to say that, while the great gifts of the artist
      are not his who dwells in some rude cot like this, yet the heart is not
      sensitively alive to all the influences of such a scene,&mdash;its lonely
      grandeur, its tranquil beauty, or its fearful sublimity,&mdash;and that
      the peasant, whose associations from infancy to age are linked with every
      barren rock and fissured crag around, has not created for himself his own
      store of fancied images, whose power is not less deeply felt that it has
      asked for no voice to tell its workings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Corvy&rdquo; was a strange specimen of architecture, and scarcely capable
      of being classified in any of the existing orders. Originally, the hut was
      formed of the stern of the corvette, which, built of timbers of great size
      and strength, alone of all the vessel resisted the waves. This, being
      placed keel uppermost, as most consisting with terrestrial notions of
      building, and accommodated with a door and two windows, the latter being
      filled with two ship-lenses, comprised the entire edifice. Rude and
      uncouth as it unquestionably was, it was regarded with mingled feelings of
      envy and admiration by all the fishermen for miles round, for while they
      had contributed their tackle and their personal aid to place the mass
      where it stood, they never contemplated its becoming the comfortable
      dwelling they soon beheld, nor were these jealous murmurings allayed by
      the assumption of a lofty flagstaff, which, in the pride of conquest, old
      M&rsquo;Grane displayed above his castle, little wotting that the banner that
      floated overhead waved with the lilies of France, and not the Union Jack
      of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sandy&rsquo;s father, however, possessed those traits of character which confer
      ascendency, whether a man&rsquo;s lot be cast among the great or the humble; and
      he soon not only subdued those ungenerous sentiments, but even induced his
      neighbors to assist him in placing a small brass carronade on the keel,
      or, as he now termed it, the ridge of his dwelling, where, however little
      serviceable for warlike purposes, it made a very specious and imposing
      ornament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the inheritance to which Sandy succeeded, and such the possession
      he ceded for a consideration to Bagenal Daly, on that eventful morning
      their acquaintance began. In course of time, however, it fell to ruin, and
      lay untenanted and uncared for, when Miss Daly, in one of her rambling
      excursions, chanced to hear of it, and, being struck by the beauty of the
      situation, resolved to refit it as a summer residence. Her first
      intentions on this head were humble enough; two small chambers at either
      side of the original edifice&mdash;now converted into a species of hall
      and a kitchen&mdash;comprised the whole, and thither she betook herself,
      with that strange secret pleasure a life of perfect solitude possesses for
      certain minds. For a year she endured the inconveniences of her narrow
      dwelling tolerably well; but as she grew more attached to the spot, she
      determined on making it more comfortable; and, communicating the resolve
      to her brother, he not only concurred in the notion, but half anticipated
      his assent by despatching an architect to the spot, under whose direction
      a cottage containing several comfortable rooms was added, and with such
      attention to the circumstances of the ground, and such regard for the
      ancient character of the building, that the traces of its origin could
      still be discovered, and its old name of &ldquo;the Corvy,&rdquo; be, even yet, not
      altogether inapplicable. The rude hulk was now, however, the centre of a
      long cottage, the timbers, partly covered by the small-leaved ivy, partly
      concealed by a rustic porch, displaying overhead the great keel and the
      flagstaff,&mdash;an ornament which no remonstrance of the unhappy
      architect could succeed in removing. As a sort of compromise, indeed, the
      carronade was dismounted, and placed beside the hall-door. This was the
      extreme stretch of compliance to which Daly assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hall, which was spacious and lofty in proportion with other parts of
      the building, was fitted with weapons of war and the chase, brought from
      many a far-off land, and assembled with an incongruity that was no mean
      type of the owner. Turkish scimitars and lances, yataghans, and Malay
      creeses were grouped with Indian bows, tomahawks, and whale harpoons,
      while richly embroidered pelisses hung beside coats of Esquimaux seal, of
      boots made from the dried skin of the sun-fish. A long Swiss rifle was
      suspended by a blue silk scarf from one wall, and, over it, a damp,
      discolored parchment bore testimony, to its being won as a prize in the
      great shooting match of the Oberland, nearly forty years before. Beneath
      these, and stretching away into a nook contrived for the purpose, was the
      bark canoe in which Daly and Sandy made their escape from the tribe of the
      Sioux, by whom they were held in captivity for six years. Two very
      unprepossessing figures, costumed as savages, sat in this frail bark,
      paddle in hand, and to all seeming resolutely intent on their purpose of
      evasion. It would have been pardonable, however, for the observer not to
      have identified in these tattooed and wild-looking personages a member of
      Parliament and his valet, even though assisted to the discovery by their
      Indian names, which, with a laudable care for public convenience, had been
      written on a card, and suspended round the neck of each. Opposite to them,
      and in the corner of the hall, stood a large black bear, with fiery
      eyeballs and snow-white teeth, so admirably counterfeiting life as almost
      to startle the beholder; while over his head was a fearful, misshapen
      figure, whose malignant look and distorted proportions at once proclaimed
      it an Indian idol. But why enumerate the strange and curious objects
      which, notwithstanding their seeming incongruity, were yet all connected
      with Daly&rsquo;s history, and formed, in fact, a kind of pictorial narrative of
      his life? Here stood the cup,&mdash;a splendid specimen of Benvenuto&rsquo;s
      chisel, given him by the Doge of Venice,&mdash;and there was the embossed
      dagger presented by a King of Spain, with a patent of Grandee of the first
      class; while in a small glass case, covered with dust, and scarce
      noticeable, was a small and beautifully shaped satin slipper, with a
      rosette of now faded silver. But of this only one knew the story, and <i>he</i>
      never revealed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we have taken an unwarrantable liberty with our reader by this too
      prolix description, our excuse is, that we might have been far more
      tiresome had we been so disposed, leaving, as we have, the greater part of
      this singular chamber unnoticed; while our <i>amende</i> is ready, and we
      will spare any further detail of the rest of the cottage, merely observing
      that it was both commodious and well arranged, and furnished not only with
      taste, but even elegance. And now to resume our long-neglected story.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about eight o&rsquo;clock of a cold, raw February night, with occasional
      showers of sleet and sudden gusts of fitful wind,&mdash;that happy
      combination which makes up the climate of the north of Ireland, and, with
      a trifling abatement of severity, constitutes its summer as well as its
      winter,&mdash;that Miss Daly sat reading in that strange apartment we have
      just mentioned, and which, from motives of economy, she occupied
      frequently during the rainy season, as the necessity of keeping it aired
      required constant fires, not so necessary in the other chambers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large hearth displayed the cheerful blaze of burning bog-deal, and an
      old Roman lamp, an ancient patern, threw its lustre on the many curious
      and uncouth objects on every side. If the flashing jets of light that
      broke from the dry wood gave at times a false air of vitality to the
      stuffed figures around, in compensation it made the only living thing
      there seem as unreal as the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrapped up in the great folds of a wide Greek capote she had taken from
      the wall, and the hood of which she had drawn over her head, Miss Daly
      bent over the yellow pages of an old quarto volume. Of her figure no trace
      could be marked, nor any guess concerning it, save that she was extremely
      tall. Her features were bold and commanding, and in youth must have been
      eminently handsome. The eyebrows were large and arched, the eyes dark and
      piercing, and the whole contour of the face had that character of
      thoughtful beauty so often seen in the Jewish race. Age and solitude,
      perhaps, had deepened the lines around the angles of the mouth and brought
      down the brows, so as to give a look of severity to features which, from
      this cause, became strikingly resembling her brother&rsquo;s. If time had made
      its sad inroad on those lineaments once so lovely, it seemed to spare even
      the slightest touch to that small white hand, which, escaping from the
      folds of her mantle, was laid upon the volume before her. The taper
      fingers were covered with rings, and more than one bracelet of great price
      glittered upon her wrist; nor did this taste seem limited to these
      displays, for in the gold combs that fastened, on either temple, her
      masses of gray hair, rich gems were set profusely, forming the strangest
      contrast to the coarse folds of that red-brown cloak in which she was
      enveloped.
    </p>
    <p>
      However disposed to profit by her studies, Miss Daly was occasionally
      broken in upon by the sound of voices from the kitchen, which, by an
      unlucky arrangement of the architect, was merely separated from the hall
      by a narrow corridor. Sometimes the sound was of laughter and merriment;
      far oftener, however, the noises betokened strife; for so it is, in the
      very smallest household&mdash;there were but two in the present case&mdash;unanimity
      will not always prevail. The contention was no less a one than that great
      national dispute which has separated the island into two wide and opposing
      parties; Miss Daly&rsquo;s butler, or man of all work, being a stout
      representative of southern Ireland; her cook an equally rigid upholder of
      the northern province. If little Dan Nelligan had the broader cause, he
      was the smaller advocate, being scarcely four feet in height; while Mrs.
      M&rsquo;Kerrigan was fifteen stone of honest weight, and with a <i>torso</i> to
      rival the Farnese Hercules. Their altercations were daily, almost hourly;
      for, living in a remote, unvisited spot, they seemed to console themselves
      for want of collision with the world by mutual disputes and disagreements.
    </p>
    <p>
      To these family jars, habit had so reconciled Miss Daly that she seldom
      noticed them; indeed, the probability is that, like the miller who wakes
      up when the mill ceases its clamors, she might have felt a kind of shock
      had matters taken a quieter course. People who employ precisely the same
      weapons cannot long continue a warfare without the superiority of one or
      the other being sure to evince itself. The diversity of the forces, on the
      contrary, suggests new combinations, and with dissimilar armor the combat
      may be prolonged to any extent. Thus was it here; Dan&rsquo;s forte was
      aggravation,&mdash;that peculiarly Irish talent which makes much out of
      little, and, when cultivated with the advantages of natural gifts, enables
      a man to assume the proud political position of an Agitator, and in time a
      Liberator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. M&rsquo;Kerrigan, slow of thought, and slower of speech, was ill-suited to
      repel the assaults of so wily and constant a foe; she consequently fell
      back on the prerogatives of her office in the household, and repaid all
      Dan&rsquo;s declamation by changes in his diet,&mdash;a species of retribution
      the heaviest she could have hit upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the present cause of disturbance, and such the reason for Dan&rsquo;s
      loud denunciations on the &ldquo;black north,&rdquo; uttered with a volubility and
      vehemence that pertain to a very different portion of the empire. Twice
      had Miss Daly rung the little hand-bell that stood beside her to enforce
      order, but it was unnoticed in the clamor of the fray, while louder and
      louder grew the angry voice of Dan Nelligan, which at length was plainly
      audible in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look now, see then, may the divil howld a looking-glass to your sins, but
      I &lsquo;ll show it to the mistress! I may, may I? That &lsquo;s what you &lsquo;re
      grumbling, ye ould black-mouthed Prasbytarien! &lsquo;T is the fine supper to
      put before a crayture wet to the skin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinna ye hear the bell, Nelly?&rdquo; This was an epithet of insult the little
      man could not endure. &ldquo;Ye &lsquo;d ken the tinkle o&rsquo; that, av ye heard it at the
      mass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, listen to the ould heretic! Oh, holy Joseph! there &lsquo;s the way to talk
      of the blessed ould ancient religion! Give me the dish; I &lsquo;ll bring it
      into the parlor this minit, I will. I &lsquo;ll lave the place,&mdash;my time&rsquo;s
      up in March. I would n&rsquo;t live in the house wid you for a mine of goold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are ye no goin&rsquo; to show the fish to the leddy?&rdquo; growled out the cook, in
      her quiet barytone.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Miss Daly&rsquo;s bell announced that endurance had reached its
      limit, and Dan, without waiting to return the fire, hastened to the hall,
      muttering as he went, loud enough to be heard, &ldquo;There, now, that&rsquo;s the
      mistress ringing, I &lsquo;m sure; but sorra bit one can hear wid your noise and
      ballyragging!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the meaning of this uproar?&rdquo; said Miss Daly, as the little man
      entered, with a very different aspect from what he wore in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis Mrs. M&rsquo;Kerrigan, my Lady; she was abusin&rsquo; the ould families in the
      county Mayo, and I could n&rsquo;t bear it; and because I would n&rsquo;t hear the
      master trated that way, she gives me nothing but fish the day after a
      black fast, though she does be ating beef under my nose when I darn&rsquo;t
      touch meat, and it&rsquo;s what, she put an ould baste of a cod before me this
      evening for my supper, and here &lsquo;s Lent will be on us in a few days more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How often have I told you,&rdquo; said Miss Daly, sternly, &ldquo;that I &lsquo;ll not
      suffer these petty, miserable squabbles to reach me? Go back to the
      kitchen; and, mark me, if I hear a whisper, or muttering ever so low in
      your voice, I &lsquo;ll put you to spend the night upon the rocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan skulked from the room like a culprit remanded to jail; but no sooner
      had he reached the kitchen than, assuming a martial air and bearing, he
      strutted up to the fire and turned his back to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said he, in a stage soliloquy, &ldquo;it was what it must come to sooner
      or later; and now she may go on her knees, and divil a foot I &lsquo;ll stay!
      It&rsquo;s not like the last time, sorra bit! I know what she &lsquo;s at&mdash;&rsquo; &lsquo;T
      is my way, Danny, you must have a pound at Avster &lsquo;&mdash;bother! I &lsquo;m
      used to that now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the bell again, ye auld blethering deevil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. M&rsquo;Kerrigan ran no risk of a reply now, for at the first tinkle
      Dan was back in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is some one knocking at the wicket without; see who it may be at
      this late hour of the night,&rdquo; said Miss Daly, without raising her head
      from the book, for, strange as were such sounds in that solitary place,
      her attention was too deeply fixed on the page before her to admit of even
      a momentary distraction of thought. Dan left the room with becoming
      alacrity, but in reality bent on anything rather than the performance of
      his errand. Of all the traits of his southern origin, none had the same
      predominance in his nature as a superstitious fear of spirits and goblins,&mdash;a
      circumstance not likely to be mitigated by his present lonely abode,
      independently of the fact that more than one popular belief attributed
      certain unearthly sights and sounds to the old timbers of &ldquo;the Corvy,&rdquo;
       whose wreck was associated with tales of horror sufficient to shake
      stouter nerves than &ldquo;Danny&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he received this order from his mistress, he heard it pretty much as
      a command to lead a forlorn hope, and sat himself down at the outside of
      the door to consider what course to take. While he was thus meditating,
      the sounds became plainly audible, a loud and distinct knocking was heard
      high above the whistling wind and drifting rain, accompanied from time to
      time by a kind of shout, or, as it seemed to Dan&rsquo;s ears, a scream like the
      cry of a drowning man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinna ye hear that, ye auld daft body?&rdquo; said Nancy, as, pale with fear,
      and trembling in every limb, Dan entered the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do indeed, Mrs. Mac,&rdquo;&mdash;this was the peace appellation he always
      conferred on Nancy,&mdash;&ldquo;I hear it, and my heart &lsquo;s beatin&rsquo; for every
      stroke I listen to; &lsquo;t is n&rsquo;t afeard I am, but a kind of a notion I have,
      like a dhrame, you know &ldquo;&mdash;(here he gave a sort of hysterical giggle)&mdash;&ldquo;as
      if the ould French Captain was coming to look after his hand, that was
      chopped off with the hatchet when he grasped hold of the rock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He canna hae muckle use for it noo,&rdquo; responded Nancy, dryly, as she
      smoked away as unconcerned as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or the mate!&rdquo; said Dan, giving full vent to his store of horrors; &ldquo;they
      say, when he got hold of the rope, that they gave it out so fast as he
      hauled on it, till he grew faint, and sank under the waves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s no likely to want a piece of spunyarn at this time o&rsquo; day,&rdquo; rejoined
      Nancy again. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s knocking brawly, whoever he be; had ye no better do the
      leddy&rsquo;s bidding, and see who &lsquo;s there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it be plazing to you, Mrs. Mac,&rdquo; said Dan, in his most melting
      accents, &ldquo;to come as far as the little grass-plot, just out of curiosity,
      ye know, to say ye seen it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na, na, my bra&rsquo; wee mon, ye maun ee&rsquo;n gae by your-sel&rsquo;; I dinna ken
      mickle about sperits and ghaists, but I hae a gude knowledge of the
      rheumatiz without seekin&rsquo; it on a night like this. There&rsquo;s the leddy&rsquo;s
      bell again, she &lsquo;s no pleased wi&rsquo; yer delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say I was puttin&rsquo; on my shoes, Nancy,&rdquo; said Dan, as his teeth chattered
      with fear, while he took down an old blunderbuss from its place above the
      fire, and which had never been stirred for years past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lay her back agen where ye found her,&rdquo; said Nancy, dryly; &ldquo;is na every
      fule kens the like o&rsquo; them! Take your mass-book, and the gimcracks ye hae
      ower your bed, but dinna try mortal weapons with them creatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ironical as the tone of this counsel unquestionably was, Dan was in no
      mood to reject it altogether, and he slipped from its place within his
      breast to a more ostensible position a small blessed token, or &ldquo;gospel,&rdquo;
       as it is called, which he always wore round his neck. By this time the
      clank of the bell kept pace with the knocking sounds without, and poor Dan
      was fairly at his wits&rsquo; end which enemy to face. Some vague philosophy
      about the &ldquo;devil you know, and the devil you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; seemed to decide his
      course, for he rushed from the kitchen in a state of frenzied desperation,
      and, with the blunderbuss at full cock, took the way towards the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wicket, as it was termed, was in reality a strong oak gate, garnished
      at top with a row of very formidable iron spikes, and as it was hung
      between two jagged and abrupt masses of rock, formed a very sufficient
      outwork, though a very needless one, since the slightest turn to either
      side would have led to the cottage without any intervening barrier to
      pass. This fact it was which now increased Dan Nelligan&rsquo;s terrors, as he
      reasoned that nobody but a ghost or evil spirit would be bothering himself
      at the wicket, when there was a neat footpath close by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; cried Dan, with a voice that all his efforts could not
      render steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out and open the gate,&rdquo; shouted a deep voice in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till you tell me where you come from, and who you are, if you are
      &lsquo;lucky.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I &lsquo;m not,&rdquo; cried the other, with something very like a deep groan;
      &ldquo;if I were, I &lsquo;d scarce be here now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s honest? anyhow,&rdquo; muttered Dan, who interpreted the phrase in its
      popular acceptation among the southern peasantry. &ldquo;And what are you come
      back for, alanah?&rdquo; continued he, in a most conciliating tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open the gate, and don&rsquo;t keep me here answering your stupid questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though these words were uttered with a round, strong intonation that
      sounded very like the present world, Dan made no other reply than an
      endeavor to repeat a Latin prayer against evil spirits, when suddenly, and
      with a loud malediction on his obstinacy, Dan saw &ldquo;the thing,&rdquo; as he
      afterwards described it, take a flying leap over the gate, at least ten
      feet high, and come with a bang on the grass, not far from where he stood.
      To fire off his blunderbuss straight at the drifting clouds over his head,
      and to take to flight was Dan&rsquo;s only impulse, screaming out, &ldquo;the Captain
      &lsquo;s come! he&rsquo;s come!&rdquo; at the very top of his lungs. The little strength he
      possessed only carried him to the kitchen door, where, completely overcome
      with terror, he dropped senseless on the ground.

    <p>
      While this was occurring, Miss Daly, alarmed by the report of fire-arms,
      but without any personal fears of danger, threw open the hall door and
      called out, &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; and as the dark shadow of a figure came
      nearer, &ldquo;Who are you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Forester, madam,&mdash;a friend of your brother&rsquo;s; for I
      perceive I have the honor to address Miss Daly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the stranger had advanced into the full light of the lamp
      within, where his appearance, tired and travel-stained as he was,
      corroborated his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had a very uncourteous welcome, sir,&rdquo; said Miss Daly, extending
      her hand and leading him within the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reception was near being a warm one, I fear,&rdquo; said Forester, smiling;
      &ldquo;for as I unfortunately, growing rather impatient, threw my carpet bag
      over the gate, intending to climb it afterwards, some one fired at me,&mdash;not
      with a good aim, however; for I heard the slugs rattling on a high cliff
      behind me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Dan, I am certain, mistook you for a ghost or a goblin,&rdquo; said Miss
      Daly, laughing, as if the affair were an excellent joke devoid of all
      hazard; &ldquo;we have few visitors down here from either world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, madam, I will confess it, if the roads are only as impassable for
      ghosts as for men of mortal mould, I &lsquo;m not surprised at it. I left
      Coleraine at three o&rsquo;clock to-day, where I was obliged to exchange my
      travelling carriage for a car, and I have been travelling ever since,
      sometimes on what seemed a highway, far oftener, however, across fields
      with now and then an intervening wall to throw down,&mdash;which we did, I
      own, unceremoniously; while lifting the horse twice out of deep holes,
      mending a shaft, and splicing the traces, lost some time. The driver, too,
      was once missing,&mdash;a fact I only discovered after leaving him half a
      mile behind. In fact, the whole journey was full of small adventures up to
      the moment when we came to a dead stand at the foot of a high cliff, where
      the driver told me the road stopped, and that the rest of my way must be
      accomplished on foot; and on my asking what direction to take, he brought
      me some distance off to the top of a rock, whence I could perceive the
      twinkling of a light, and said, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the Corvy.&rsquo; I did my best to
      secure his services as a guide, but no offer of money nor persuasions
      could induce him to leave his horse and come any further; and now,
      perhaps, I can guess the reason,&mdash;there is some superstition about
      the place at nightfall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, you &lsquo;re mistaken there, sir; few of these people, however they
      may credit such tales, are terrified by them. It was the northern spirit
      dictated the refusal: his contract was to go so far, it would have &lsquo;put
      him out of his way&rsquo; to go further, and his calculation was that all the
      profit he could fairly derive&mdash;and he never speculated on anything
      unfair&mdash;would not repay him. Such are the people of this province.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trait is honest, I &lsquo;ve no doubt, but it can scarcely be the source of
      many amiable ones,&rdquo; said Forester, smarting under the recent
      inconvenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We &lsquo;ll talk of that after supper,&rdquo; said Miss Daly, rising, &ldquo;and I leave
      you to make a good fire while I go to give some orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I not have the honor to present my credentials first?&rdquo; said Forester,
      handing Bagenal Daly&rsquo;s letter to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother is quite well, is he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In excellent health; I left him but two days since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The despatch will keep, then,&rdquo; said she, thrusting it into a letter-rack
      over the chimney-piece, while she left the room to make the arrangement
      she spoke of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Daly&rsquo;s absence was not of long duration, but, brief as it was, it
      afforded Forester time enough to look around at the many strange and
      incongruous decorations of the apartment, nor had he ceased his wonderment
      when Dan, pale and trembling in every limb, entered, tray in hand, to lay
      the supper-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      With many a sidelong, stealthy look, Dan performed his duties, as it was
      easy to see that however disposed to regard the individual before him as
      of this world&rsquo;s company, &ldquo;the thing that jumped out of the sky,&rdquo; as he
      called it, was yet an unexplained phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you are surprised by the motley companionship that surrounds me,&rdquo;
       said Miss Daly; &ldquo;but, as a friend of Bagenal&rsquo;s, and acquainted, doubtless,
      with his eccentric habits, they will astonish you less. Come, let me hear
      about him,&mdash;is he going to pay me a visit down here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear not, at this moment,&rdquo; said Forester, with an accent of melancholy;
      &ldquo;his friendship is heavily taxed at the present juncture. You have heard,
      perhaps, of the unhappy event which has spread such dismay in Dublin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! what is it? I hear of nothing, and see nobody here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A certain Mr. Gleeson, the trusted agent of many country gentlemen, has
      suddenly fled&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Forester could continue, Miss Daly arose, and tore open her
      brother&rsquo;s letter. For a few seconds Forester was struck with the wonderful
      resemblance to her brother, as, with indrawn breath and compressed lips,
      she read; but gradually her color faded away, her hands trembled, and the
      paper fell from them, while, with a voice scarcely audible, she whispered:
      &ldquo;And it has come to this!&rdquo; Covering her face with the folds of her cloak,
      she sat for some minutes buried in deep sorrow; and when she again looked
      up, years seemed to have passed over, and left their trace upon her
      countenance: it was pale and haggard, and a braid of gray hair, escaping
      beneath her cap, had fallen across her cheek, and increased the sad
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So is it,&rdquo; said she, aloud, but speaking as though to herself,&mdash;&ldquo;so
      is it: the heavy hand is laid on all in turn; happier they who meet
      misfortune early in life, when the courage is high and the heart
      unshrinking: if the struggle be life-long, the victory is certain; but
      after years of all the world can give of enjoyment&mdash;You know Maurice?&mdash;you
      know the Knight, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam, slightly; but with Lady Eleanor and her daughter I have the
      honor of intimate acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not ask how he bears up against a blow like this. If his own fate
      only hung in the balance, I could tell that myself; but for his wife, to
      whom they say he is so devotedly attached&mdash;you know it was a
      love-match, so they called it in England, because the daughter of an Earl
      married the first Commoner in Ireland. And Bagenal advises their coming
      here! Well, perhaps he is right; they will at least escape the insolence
      of pity in this lonely spot. Oh! sir, believe me, there is a weighty load
      of responsibility on those who rule us; these things are less the faults
      of individuals than of a system. You began here by confiscation, you would
      finish by corruption. Stimulating to excesses of every kind a people ten
      times more excitable than your own,&mdash;now flattering, now goading,&mdash;teaching
      them to vie with you in display while you mocked the recklessness of their
      living, you chafed them into excesses of alternate loyalty or rebellion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However satisfied of its injustice, Forester made no reply to this burst
      of passion, but sat without speaking as she resumed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will say there are knaves in every country, and that this Gleeson was
      of our rearing; but I deny it, sir. I tell you he was a base counterfeit
      we have borrowed from yourselves. That meek, submissive manner, that
      patient drudgery of office, that painstaking, petty rectitude, make up
      &lsquo;your respectable men;&rsquo; and in this garb of character the business of life
      goes on with you. And why? Because you take it at its worth. But here, in
      Ireland, we go faster; trust means full confidence,&mdash;confidence
      without limit or bound; and then, too often, ruin without redemption.
      Forgive me, sir; age and sorrow both have privileges, and I perhaps have
      more cause than most others to speak warmly on this theme. Now, let me
      escape my egotism by asking you to eat, for I see we have forgotten our
      supper all this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From that moment Miss Daly never adverted further to the burden of her
      brother&rsquo;s letter, but led Forester to converse about his journey and the
      people whom, even in his brief experience, he perceived to be so unlike
      the peasantry of the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, in reply to an observation of his, &ldquo;these diversities of
      character observable in different places are doubtless intended, like the
      interminable varieties of natural productions, to increase our interest in
      life, and, while extending the sphere of speculation, to contribute to our
      own advancement. Few people, perhaps not any, are to be found without some
      traits of amiability; here there is much to be respected, and, when habit
      has dulled the susceptibility of first impressions, much also to be liked.
      But shall I not have the pleasure of showing you my neighbors and my
      neighborhood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My visit must be of the shortest; I rather took than obtained my leave of
      absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, even a brief visit will do something; for my neighbors all dwell in
      cottages, and my neighborhood comprises the narrow strip of coast between
      this hut and the sea, whose plash you hear this minute. To-morrow you will
      be rested from your journey, and if the day permits we &lsquo;ll try the
      Causeway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forester accepted the invitation so frankly proffered, and went to his
      room not sorry to lay his head upon a pillow after two weary nights upon
      the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forester was almost shocked as he entered the breakfast-room on the
      following morning to see the alteration in Miss Daly&rsquo;s appearance. She had
      evidently passed a night of great sorrow, and seemed with difficulty to
      bear up against the calamitous tidings of which he was the bearer. She
      endeavored, it is true, to converse on matters of indifference,&mdash;the
      road he had travelled, the objects he had seen, and so on; but the effort
      was ever interrupted by broken snatches of reflection that would vent
      themselves in words, and all of which bore on the Knight and his fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Forester&rsquo;s account of her brother Bagenal&rsquo;s devotion to his friend she
      listened with eager interest, asking again and again what part he had
      taken, whether his counsels were deemed wise ones, and if he still enjoyed
      to the fullest extent the confidence of his old friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no friendship of yesterday, sir,&rdquo; said she, with a heightened color
      and a flashing eye; &ldquo;they knew each other as boys, they walked the
      mountains together as young men, speculated on the future paths fate might
      open before them, and the various ambitions which, even then, stirred
      within them. Bagenal was ever rash, headstrong, and impetuous, rarely firm
      in purpose till some obstacle seemed to defy its accomplishment. Maurice&mdash;the
      Knight, I mean&mdash;was not less resolute when roused, but more often so
      much disposed to concede to others that he would postpone his wishes to
      their own; and once believing himself in any way pledged to a course,
      would forget all, save the fulfilment of the implied promise. Such were
      the two dispositions, which, acting and reacting on each other, effected
      the ruin of both: the one wasted in eccentricity what the other squandered
      in listless indifference; and with abilities enough to have won
      distinction for humble men, they have earned no other reputation than that
      of singularity or convivialism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for Bagenal,&rdquo; she said, after a pause, &ldquo;wealth was never but an
      incumbrance to him; he was one of those persons who never saw any use for
      money, save in the indulgence of mere caprice; he treated his great
      fortune as a spoiled child will do a toy, and never rested till he had
      pulled it to pieces, and perhaps derived the same moral lesson too,&mdash;astonishment
      at the mere trifle which once amused him. But Maurice Darcy,&mdash;whose
      tastes were ever costly and cultivated, who regarded splendor not as the
      means of vulgar display, but as the fitting accompaniment of a house
      illustrious by descent and deeds, and deemed that all about and around him
      should bear the impress of himself, generous and liberal as he was,&mdash;how
      is he to bear this reverse? Tell me of Lady Eleanor; and Miss Darcy, is
      she like the Knight, or has her English blood given the character to her
      beauty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very like her father,&rdquo; said Forester, &ldquo;but more so even in
      disposition than in features.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How happy I am to hear it,&rdquo; said Miss Daly, hastily; &ldquo;and she is, then,
      high-spirited and buoyant? What gifts in an hour like this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say truly, madam, she will not sink beneath the stroke, believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this news has reconciled me to much of your gloomier tidings,&rdquo; said
      Miss Daly; &ldquo;and now let us wander out upon the hills; I feel as if we
      could talk more freely as we stroll along the beach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Daly arose as she spoke, and led the way through the little garden
      wicket, which opened on a steep pathway down to the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will be a favorite walk with Helen, I&rsquo;m certain,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;The
      caves are all accessible at low water, and the view of Fairhead finer than
      from any other point. I must instruct you to be a good and a safe guide. I
      must teach you all the art and mystery of the science, make you learned in
      the chronicles of Dunluce, and rake up for you legends of ghostcraft and
      shipwreck enough to make the fortunes of a romancer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you heartily,&rdquo; said Forester; &ldquo;but I cannot remain here to meet
      my friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I understand you,&rdquo; said Miss Daly, who in reality put a wrong
      interpretation on his words; &ldquo;but you shall be my guest. There is a little
      village about four miles from this, where I intend to take up my abode. I
      hope you will not decline hospitality which, if humble, is at least freely
      proffered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret deeply,&rdquo; said Forester, and he spoke in a tone of sorrow, &ldquo;that
      I cannot accept your kindness. I stand in a position of no common
      difficulty at this moment.&rdquo; He hesitated, as if doubting whether to
      proceed or not, and then, in a more hurried voice, resumed: &ldquo;There is no
      reason why I should obtrude my own petty cares and trials where greater
      misfortunes are impending; but I cannot help telling you that I have been
      rash enough, in a moment of impatience, to throw up an appointment I held
      on the Viceroy&rsquo;s Staff, and I know not how far the step may yet involve me
      with my relatives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me how came you first acquainted with the Darcys?&rdquo; said Miss Daly,
      as if following out in her own mind a train of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be frank with you,&rdquo; said Forester, &ldquo;for I cannot help being so;
      there are cases where confidence is not a virtue, but a necessity. Every
      word you speak, every tone of your voice, is so much your brother&rsquo;s that I
      feel as if I were confiding to him in another form. I learned to know the
      Knight of Gwynne in a manner which you may deem, perhaps, little
      creditable to myself, though I trust you will see that I neither abused
      the knowledge nor perverted the honor of the acquaintanceship. It was in
      this wise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Briefly, but without reserve, Forester narrated the origin of his first
      journey to the West, and, without implicating the honor of his relative,
      Lord Castlereagh, explained the nature of his mission, to ascertain the
      sentiments of the Knight, and the possibility of winning him to the side
      of the Government. His own personal adventures could not, of course, be
      omitted, in such a narrative; but he touched on the theme as slightly as
      he could, and only dwelt on the kindness he had experienced in his long
      and dangerous illness, and the long debt of gratitude which bound him to
      the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the intimacy that succeeded he could not help speaking, and, whether
      from his studied avoidance of her name, or that, when replying to any
      question of Miss Daly&rsquo;s concerning Helen Darcy, his manner betrayed
      agitation, certain it is that when he concluded, Miss Daly&rsquo;s eyes were
      turned towards him with an expression of deep significance that called the
      color to his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, sir,&rdquo; said she, in a slow and measured voice, &ldquo;you went down to
      play the tempter, and were captured yourself. Come, come, I know your
      secret; you have told it by signs less treacherous than words; and Helen,&mdash;for
      I tell you freely my interest is stronger for her,&mdash;how is she
      disposed towards you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forester never spoke, but hung his head abashed and dejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I see it all,&rdquo; said Miss Daly, hurriedly; &ldquo;you would win the
      affection of a generous and high-souled girl by the arts which find favor
      in your more polished world, and you have found that the fascinations of
      manner and the glittering <i>éclat</i> of an aide-de-camp have failed.
      Now, take my counsel. But first let me ask, is this affection the mere
      prompting of an idle or capricious moment, or do you love her with a
      passion round which the other objects of your life are to revolve and
      depend? I understand that pressure of the hand; it is enough. My advice is
      simple. You belong to a profession second to none in its high and great
      rewards: do not waste its glorious opportunities by the life of a
      courtier; be a soldier in feeling as well as in garb; let her whose heart
      you would win, feel that in loving you she is paying the tribute to
      qualities that make men esteem and respect you; that she is not bestowing
      her hand upon the mere favorite of a Court, but on one whose ambitions are
      high, and whose darings are generous. Oh! leave nothing, or as little as
      you may, to mere influence; let your boast be, and it will be a proud one,
      that with high blood and a noble name you have started fairly in the race,
      and distanced your competitors. This is my counsel. What think you of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will follow it,&rdquo; said Forester, firmly; &ldquo;I will follow it, though, I
      own it to you, it suggests no hope, where hope would be happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Miss Daly, &ldquo;you shall spend this day with me, and I
      will not keep you another; you have made me your friend by this
      confidence, and I will use the trust with delicacy and with fidelity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I write to you?&rdquo; said Forester, &ldquo;and will you let me hear from you
      again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure; I should have asked it myself had you not done so. Now,
      let us talk of the first steps to be taken in this affair; and here is a
      bench where we can rest ourselves while we chat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forester sat down beside her, and, in the freedom of one to whom fortune
      had so unexpectedly presented a confidante, opened all the secret store of
      his cares and hopes and fears. It was late when they turned again towards
      &ldquo;the Corvy,&rdquo; but the youth&rsquo;s step was lighter, and his brow more open,
      while his heart was higher than many a previous day had found him.

      CHAPTER XXVII. THE KNIGHT&rsquo;S RETURN
    </h2>
    <p>
      We must now for a brief space, return to the Knight, as with a heavy heart
      he journeyed homeward. Never did the long miles seem so wearisome before,
      often and often as he had travelled them. The little accidental delays,
      which once he had met with a ready jest, and in a spirit of kindly
      indulgence, he now resented as so many intentional insults upon his
      changed and ruined fortune. The gossiping landlords, to whom he had ever
      extended so much of freedom, he either acknowledged coldly, or repelled
      with distance; their liberties were now construed into want of deference
      and respect; the very jestings of the postboys to each other seemed so
      many covert impertinences, and equivocal allusions to himself; for even so
      much will the stroke of sudden misfortune change the nature, and convert
      the contented and happy spirit into a temperament of gloomy sorrow and
      suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unconscious of his own altered feelings, and looking at every object
      through the dim light of his own calamity, he hurried along, not, as of
      old, recognizing each well-known face, saluting this one, inquiring after
      that; he sat back in his carriage, and, with his hat drawn almost over his
      eyes, neither noticed the way nor the wayfarers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this mood it was he entered Castlebar. The sight of his well-remembered
      carriage drew crowds of beggars to the door of the inn, every one of whom
      had some special prayer for aid, or some narrative of sickness for his
      hearing. By the time the horses drew up, the crowd numbered some hundreds
      of every variety, not only in age, but in raggedness, all eagerly calling
      on him by name, and imploring his protection on grounds the most strange
      and dissimilar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew the sound of the wheels; ax Biddy if I did n&rsquo;t say it was his
      honor was coming!&rdquo; cried one, in a sort of aside intended for the Knight
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye &lsquo;re welcome home, sir; long may you reign over us,&rdquo; said an old fellow
      with a beard like a pilgrim. &ldquo;I dreamed I seen you last night standing at
      the door there, wid a half-crown in your fingers. &lsquo;Ouid Luke,&rsquo; says you,
      &lsquo;come here!&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A burst of rude laughter drowned this sage parable, while a good-looking
      young woman, with an expression of softness in features degraded by
      poverty and its consequences, courtesied low, and tried to attract his
      notice, as she held up a miserable-looking infant to the carriage window.
      &ldquo;Clap them, acushla! &lsquo;t is proud he is to see you back again, sir; he
      never forgets the goold guinea ye gave him on New Year&rsquo;s Day! Don&rsquo;t be
      pushin&rsquo; that way, you rude cray-tures; you want to hurt the child, and
      it&rsquo;s the image of his honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many returns of the blessed sason to you,&rdquo; growled out a creature in a
      bonnet, but in face and figure far more like a man than a woman; &ldquo;throw us
      out a fippenny to buy two ounces of tay. Asy, asy; don&rsquo;t be drivin&rsquo; me
      under the wheels&mdash;ugh! it&rsquo;s no place for a faymale, among such
      rapscallions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did they give you, Maurice? how much did you get, honey?&rdquo; cried a
      tall and almost naked fellow, that leaned over the heads of several
      others, and put his face close to the glass of the carriage, which, for
      safety&rsquo;s sake, the Knight now let down, while he called aloud to the
      postboys to make haste and bring out the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us all about it, Maurice, my boy,&mdash;are you a lord, or a
      bishop?&rdquo; cried the tall fellow, with an eagerness of face that told his
      own sad bereavement, for he was deranged in intellect from a fall from one
      of the cliffs on the coast. &ldquo;By my conscience, I think I must change my
      politics myself soon; my best pantaloons is like Nat Fitzgibbon,&mdash;it
      has resigned its sate! Out with a bit of silver here!&mdash;quick, I
      didn&rsquo;t kiss the King&rsquo;s face this ten days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To all these entreaties Darcy seemed perfectly deaf; if his eyes wandered
      over the crowd, they noticed nothing there, nor did he appear to listen to
      a word around him, while he again asked why the horses were not coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing our best, your honor,&rdquo; cried a postboy, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s mighty hard
      to get through these divils; they won&rsquo;t stir till the beasts is trampling
      them down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive on, then, and let them take care of themselves,&rdquo; said the Knight,
      sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O blessed Father! there&rsquo;s a way to talk of the poor! O heavenly Vargin!
      but you are come back cruel to us, after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive on!&rdquo; shouted out Darcy, in a voice of angry impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postboys sprang into their saddles, cracked their whips, and dashed
      forward, while the mob, rent in a hundred channels, fled on every side,
      with cries of terror and shouts of laughter, according as the distance
      suggested danger or security. All escaped safely, except the poor idiot,
      Flury, who, having one foot on the step when the carriage started, was
      thrown backward, when, to save himself, he grasped the spring, and was
      thus half dragged, half carried along to the end of the street, and there,
      failing strength and fear combining, he relinquished his hold and fell
      senseless to the ground, where the wheel grazed but did not injure him as
      he lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a cry of terror, the Knight called out &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; and, flinging wide the
      door, sprang out. To lift the poor fellow up to a sitting posture was the
      work of a second, while he asked, in accents the very kindest, if he were
      hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorra bit, Maurice,&rdquo; said the fellow, whose faculties sooner rallied than
      if they were habitually under better control. &ldquo;I was on the wrong side of
      the coach, that&rsquo;s all; &lsquo;t is safer to be within. The clothes is not the
      better of it,&rdquo; said he, looking at his sleeve, now hanging in stripes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that, Flury; we&rsquo;ll soon repair that misfortune; it does not
      signify much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does n&rsquo;t it, faith?&rdquo; said the other, shaking his head dubiously; &ldquo;&lsquo;tis
      asy talking, but I can&rsquo;t turn my coat without showing the hole in it. &lsquo;T
      is only the rich can do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Knight bit his lip; for even from the fool&rsquo;s sarcasm he could gather
      the imputations already rife upon his conduct. Another and a very
      different thought succeeded to this, and he blushed with shame to think
      how far his sense of his own misfortune had rendered him indifferent, not
      only to the kindly feelings, but the actual misery, of others. The right
      impulses of high-minded men are generally rapid in their action, like the
      spring of the bent bow when the cord is cut asunder. It did not cost Darcy
      many minutes to be again the warm-hearted, generous soul nature had made
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Flury,&rdquo; said he to the poor fellow, as he stood ruefully surveying
      his damaged drapery, &ldquo;give that among the people there in the town, and
      keep this for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is goold, Maurice,&mdash;yellow goold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is; but you&rsquo;re not the less welcome to it; tell them, too, that I
      have had troubles of my own lately; and that&rsquo;s the reason I hurried on
      without exchanging a word with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know, Maurice, but I&rsquo;ll keep it all to myself?&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d trust you with a heavier sum,&rdquo; said the Knight, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know why,&mdash;I know why, well enough,&mdash;because I&rsquo;m a fool.
      Never mind, there&rsquo;s greater fools nor me going. What did they give you up
      there for your vote, Maurice,&mdash;tell me, how much was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Knight shook his head, and Flury resumed: &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say it? Wasn&rsquo;t I
      right? By my ould hat! there&rsquo;s two fools in the country now;&mdash;Maurice
      Darcy and Red Flury; and Maurice the biggest of the two! Whoop, the more
      the merrier; there &lsquo;s room for us all!&rdquo; And with this wise reflection,
      Flury gave a very wild caper and a wilder shout, and set off at the speed
      of a hare towards Castlebar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knight resumed his journey, and in a more contented mood. The little
      incident had called on him for an exertion, and his faculties only needed
      the demand to respond to the call. He summoned to his aid, besides, every
      comforting reflection in his power; he persuaded himself that there were
      some hopes remaining still, and tried to believe the evil not beyond
      remedy. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;we are together; it is not death has
      been dealing with us, nor is there any stain upon our fair fame; and, save
      these, all ills are light, and can be borne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From thoughts like these he was aroused by the heavy clank of the iron
      gate, as it fell back to admit the carriage within the park, while a
      thousand welcomes saluted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Darby!&mdash;thank you, Mary! All well up at the abbey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the carriage dashed past at full speed, and the answer was drowned in
      the tumult. The postboys, true to the etiquette of their calling, had
      reserved their best pace for the finish, and it was at the stride of a
      hunting gallop they now tore along.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a calm night, with a young faint moon and a starry sky, which,
      without displaying in bright light the details of the scenery, yet
      exhibited them in strong, bold masses, making all seem even more imposing
      and grander than in reality; the lofty mountain appeared higher, the dark
      woods vaster, and the wide-spreading lawn seemed to stretch away into
      immense plains. Darcy&rsquo;s heart swelled with pride as he looked, while a
      pang shot through him as he thought, if even at that hour he could call
      them his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had now reached a little glen, where the postboys were obliged to
      walk their blown cattle; emerging from this, they passed a thick grove of
      beech, and at once came in sight of the abbey. Darcy leaned anxiously from
      the window to catch the first sight of home, when what was his amazement
      to perceive that the whole was lighted up from end to end. The great suite
      of state rooms were a blaze of lustres, which even at that distance
      glittered in their starry brilliancy, and showed the shadows of figures
      moving within. He well knew that Lady Eleanor never saw company in his
      absence,&mdash;what could this mean? Tortured with doubts that in his then
      state of mind took every painful form, he ordered the postilions to get on
      faster, and at the very top of their speed they tore along, over the wide
      lawn, across the terrace drive, up the steep ascent to the gate tower into
      the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was also brilliantly lighted by lamps from the walls, and also by the
      lights of numerous carriage lamps which crowded the ample space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this? Can no one tell me?&rdquo; muttered the Knight, as he leaped from
      the carriage, and, seizing a livery servant who was passing, said, &ldquo;What
      is going on here? What company has the abbey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Full of company,&rdquo; said the man, in an English accent; &ldquo;there &lsquo;s my Lord&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Earl of Netherby, sir, and Sir Harry Beauclerk, and Colonel Crofton,
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did they arrive?&rdquo; said the Knight, interrupting a catalogue, every
      name of which, although unknown, sent a feeling like a stab through his
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They came the evening before last, sir; Mr. Lionel Darcy, who arrived the
      same morning&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he here?&rdquo; cried the Knight; and, without waiting for more, hastened
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants, of whom there seemed a great number about, were in strange
      liveries, and unknown to the Knight; nor was it without undergoing a very
      cool scrutiny from them that Darcy succeeded in gaining admittance to his
      own house. At last he reached the foot of the great stair, whence the
      sounds of music and the din of voices filled the air; servants hurried
      along with refreshments, or carried orders to others in waiting; all was
      bustle and excitement, in the midst of which Darcy stood only half
      conscious of the reality of what he saw, and endeavoring to reason himself
      into a conviction of what he heard. It was at this moment that several
      officers of a newly quartered regiment passed up, admiring, as they went,
      the splendor of the house, and the magnificent preparations they witnessed
      on every side.

    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Dallas,&rdquo; cried one, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re always talking of your uncle Beverley:
      does he do the thing in this style, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; interposed a short, thick-set major, with a bushy beard and
      eyebrows, &ldquo;this is what I call going the pace: do they give dinners here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that they do,&rdquo; said a white-faced, ghostly looking ensign; &ldquo;I heard
      all about this place from Giles of the 40th; he was quartered six months
      in this county, and used to grub here half the week. The old fellow is n&rsquo;t
      at home now, but they say he&rsquo;s a trump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drink his health, Watkins,&rdquo; cried the first speaker, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s
      champagne going up;&rdquo; and so saying, the party gathered around two
      servants, one of whom carried an ice-pail with some bottles, and the other
      a tray of glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does any one know his name, though?&rdquo; said the major, as he held his glass
      to be filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s something like&mdash;Oh, you know that fellow that joined us at
      Coventry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brereton, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, hang it! I mean the fellow that had the crop-eared cob with the white
      legs. Never mind, here he goes, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know who you mean,&mdash;it was Jack Quin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the name; and your friend here is called &lsquo;Gwynne,&rsquo; I think. Here,
      gentlemen, I give you Gwynne&rsquo;s health, and all the honors; may he live a
      few centuries more&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a warm heart and a cool cellar,&rdquo; added one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pink champagne, and red-coats to drink it,&rdquo; chimed in the ensign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I join you in that pleasant sentiment, gentlemen?&rdquo; said the Knight,
      bowing courteously, as he took a glass from the tray and held it towards
      the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make no apology, sir,&rdquo; said the major, eying him rather superciliously,
      for the travelling dress concealed the Knight&rsquo;s appearance, and
      distinguished him but slightly from many of those lounging around the
      doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital ginger-beer that! eh?&rdquo; said the ensign, as, winking at his
      companions, he proceeded to quiz the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have certainly drunk worse,&rdquo; said the Knight, gravely,&mdash;&ldquo;at an
      infantry mess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause before he uttered the last three words, which gave them
      a more direct application; a stare, half stupid, half impertinent, was,
      however, all they elicited, and the group moved on, while the Knight,
      disencumbering himself of his travelling gear, slowly followed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grim old gentlemen these, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; said the major, gazing at the long
      line of family portraits that covered the walls; &ldquo;that fellow with the
      truncheon does not seem to like the look of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a bishop, I take it, with the great wig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a chancellor, man; don&rsquo;t you see the mace? But he&rsquo;s not a whit
      more civil-looking than the other; commend me to the shepherdess yonder,
      in blue satin. But come on, we &lsquo;re losing time; I hear the flourish of a
      new dance. I say,&rdquo; said he, in a whisper, &ldquo;do you see who we&rsquo;ve got behind
      us?&rdquo; And they turned and saw the Knight as he mounted the stairs behind
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend of the family, sir?&rdquo; asked the major, in a voice that might bear
      the equivocal meaning of either impertinence or mere inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knight seemed to prefer taking it in the latter acceptation, as he
      answered mildly, &ldquo;I have that honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! indeed; well, we &lsquo;ve the misfortune to be strangers in these parts;
      only arrived in the neighborhood last week, and were invited here through
      our colonel. Would you have any objection to present us?&mdash;Major
      Hopecot of the 5th, Captain Mills, Mr. Dallas, Mr. Fothergill, Mr.
      Watkins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How the major <i>is</i> going it!&rdquo; lisped the ensign, while his goggle
      eyes rolled fearfully, and the others seemed struggling to control their
      enjoyment of such drollery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will afford me much pleasure, sir, to do your bidding,&rdquo; said the
      Knight, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the head of the column, then,&rdquo; resumed the major, making way for him
      to pass; and the Knight entered, with the others after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father&mdash;my dearest father!&rdquo; cried a voice at the moment, and,
      escaping from her partner, Helen was in a moment in bis arms. The next
      instant Lionel was also at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear children!&mdash;my sweet Helen!&mdash;and Lionel, how well you
      &lsquo;re looking, boy! Ah! Eleanor, what a pleasant surprise you have managed
      for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then perhaps you never got our letter,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, as she took
      his arm and walked forward. &ldquo;I wrote the moment I heard from Lionel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, too, wrote you a long letter from London,&rdquo; said Lionel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither reached me; but the last few days I have been so busy, and so
      much occupied.&mdash;How are you, Conolly? Delighted to see you, Martin.&mdash;And
      Lady Julia, is she here? I must take a tour and see all my friends. First
      of all, I have a duty to perform; let me introduce these gentlemen. But
      where are they? Oh, I see them yonder.&rdquo; And, as he spoke, he led Lady
      Eleanor across the room to the group of officers, who, overwhelmed with
      shame at their discovery, stood uncertain whether they should remain or
      retire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me introduce Major Hopecot and the officers of the 5th,&rdquo; said he,
      bowing courteously. &ldquo;These gentlemen are strangers, Lady Eleanor; will you
      take care that they find partners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the abashed subalterns left their major to make his speeches to Lady
      Eleanor, the Knight moved round the room with Helen still leaning on his
      arm. By this time Darcy&rsquo;s arrival was generally known, and all his old
      friends came pressing forward to see and speak to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Netherby,&rdquo; whispered Helen in the Knight&rsquo;s ear, as a tall and very
      thin old man, with an excessive affectation of youthfulness, tripped
      forward to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lord,&rdquo; exclaimed Darcy, &ldquo;what a pleasure, and what an honor to
      see you here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not come to me, Knight, so there was nothing else for it,&rdquo;
       replied the other, laughing, as he shook hands with a great display of
      cordiality. &ldquo;And you were quite right,&rdquo; continued he; &ldquo;I could not have
      received you like this. There &lsquo;s not so splendid a place in England, nor
      has it ever been my fortune to witness so much beauty.&rdquo; A half bow
      accompanied the last words, as he turned towards Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, my Lord,&rdquo; said the Knight, smiling; &ldquo;the flatteries of a
      courtier are very dangerous things when heard out of the atmosphere that
      makes them commonplace. We may take you literally, and have our heads
      turned by them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Lionel joined them, to introduce several of his friends and
      brother officers who accompanied him from England, all of whom were
      received by the Knight with that winning courtesy of manner of which he
      was a perfect master; for, not affecting either the vices or frivolities
      of youth as a claim to the consideration of younger men, the Knight
      possessed the happy temper that can concede indulgence without asking to
      partake of it, and, while losing nothing of the relish for wit and humor,
      chasten both by the fruits of a life&rsquo;s experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Helen, you must go back to your partner; that young guardsman looks
      very sulkily at me for having taken you off&mdash;yes, I insist on it.
      Lionel, look to your friends, and I &lsquo;ll join Lord Netherby&rsquo;s whist-table,
      and talk whenever permitted. Where &lsquo;s poor Tate?&rdquo; whispered he in Lady
      Eleanor&rsquo;s ear, as she just came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow! he has been ill for some days back; you know what a
      superstitious creature he is; and about a week since he got a fright,&mdash;some
      warning of a Banshee, I think; but it shook his nerves greatly, and he has
      kept his bed almost ever since. Lionel brought over some of these servants
      with him; but Lord Netherby&rsquo;s people are Legion, and the servants&rsquo; hall
      now numbers something like seventy, I hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Knight heaved a sigh; but, catching himself, tried to conceal it by a
      cough. Lady Eleanor had heard it, however, and stole a quick glance
      towards him, to evade which he turned abruptly round and spoke to some one
      near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventy, my dear Eleanor!&rdquo; said he, after a pause, and as if he had been
      reflecting over his last observation; &ldquo;and what a Babel, too, it must be!
      I heard French, German, and Italian in the hall; I think we can promise
      Irish ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lionel, &ldquo;it is the most amusing scene in the world. They had a
      ball last night in the lower gallery, where boleros and jigs succeeded
      each other, while the refreshments ranged from iced lemonade to burnt
      whiskey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did our worthy folk think of their visitors?&rdquo; said Darcy,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not over much. Paddy Lennan looked with great contempt at the men sipping
      <i>orgeat</i>, and when he saw the waltzing, merely remarked, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve a
      betther way of getting round the girls in Ireland;&rsquo; while old Pierre
      Dulange, Netherby&rsquo;s valet, persists in addressing the native company as
      &lsquo;Messieurs les Sauvages.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, for the sake of the public peace, they &lsquo;ve not got an interpreter
      among them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, all&rsquo;s safe on that score, and freedom of speech has suggested the
      most perfect code of good manners; for it would seem, as they can indulge
      themselves in the most liberal reflections on each other, they have no
      necessity of proceeding to overt acts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;let me not interrupt the revelry longer. To your
      place, Lionel, and leave me to pay my devoirs to my friends and kind
      neighbors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Knight&rsquo;s presence seemed alone wanting to fill up the measure of
      enjoyment. Most of those present were his old familiar friends, glad to
      see once more amongst them the great promoter of kind feeling and
      hospitality, while from such as were strangers he easily won golden
      opinions, the charm of courtesy being with him like a well-fitting
      garment, which graced, but did not impede, the wearer&rsquo;s motions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a hundred questions to ask and to answer. The news of the capital
      travelled in those days by slow and easy stages, and the moment was
      sufficiently eventful to warrant curiosity; and so, as he passed from
      group to group, he gave the current gossip of the time as each in turn
      asked after this circumstance or that.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he took his place beside Lord Netherby, as he sat engaged at a
      whist-table, where the gathering crowd that gradually collected soon
      converted the game into a social circle of eager talkers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who could have suspected that easy, unconstrained manner, that winning
      smile, that ready laugh, the ever-present jest, to cover the working of a
      heart so nigh to breaking? And yet he talked pleasantly and freely,
      narrating with all his accustomed humor the chit-chat of the time; and
      while of course, the great question of the hour occupied every tongue and
      ear, all Lord Netherby&rsquo;s practised shrewdness could not enable him to
      detect the exact part the Knight himself had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so they have carried the bill,&rdquo; said Conolly, with a sigh, as he
      listened to Darcy&rsquo;s account of the second reading. &ldquo;Well, though I never
      was a Parliament man, nor expected to be one, I&rsquo;m sorry for it. You think
      that strange, my Lord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means, sir. A man may love monarchy without being the heir
      apparent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; chimed in the Knight. &ldquo;I would even go further, and say
      that, without any warm devotion to a king, a man may hate a regicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Netherby&rsquo;s eyes met Darcy&rsquo;s, and the wily peer smiled with a
      significance that seemed to say, &ldquo;I know you <i>now</i>.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIIII. THE HUNT-BREAKFAST
    </h2>
    <p>
      The ball lasted till nigh daybreak; and while the greater number of the
      guests departed, some few remained, by special invitation, at the abbey,
      to join a hunting party on the following day. For this Lionel had made
      every possible preparation, desiring to let his English friends witness a
      favorable specimen of Irish sport and horsemanship. The stud and kennel
      were both in high condition, the weather favorable, and, as the old
      huntsman said, &ldquo;&lsquo;It would be hard if a fox would n&rsquo;t be agreeable enough
      to give the strange gentlemen a run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In high anticipation of the coming morning, and with many a prayer against
      a frost, they separated for the night. All within the abbey were soon
      sound asleep,&mdash;all save the Knight himself, who, the restraint of an
      assumed part withdrawn, threw himself on a sofa in his dressing-room, worn
      out and exhausted by his struggle. Ruin was inevitable,&mdash;that he well
      knew; but as yet the world knew it not, and for Lionel&rsquo;s sake he resolved
      to keep his own secret a few days longer. The visit was to last but eight
      days; two were already over; for the remaining six, then, he determined&mdash;whatever
      it might cost him&mdash;to preserve all the appearances of his former
      estate, to wear the garb and seeming of prosperity, and do the princely
      honors of a house that was never again to be his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Lionel!&rdquo; thought he; &ldquo;&lsquo;twould break the boy&rsquo;s heart if such a
      disclosure should be made now; the high and daring promptings of his bold
      spirit would not quail before misfortune, although his courage might not
      sustain him in the very moment of the reverse. I will not risk the whole
      fortune of his future happiness in such a trial; he shall know nothing
      till they are gone; one week of triumphant pleasure he shall have, and
      then let him brace himself to the struggle, and breast the current
      manfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While endeavoring to persuade himself that Lionel&rsquo;s lot was uppermost in
      his mind, his heart would force the truth upon him that Lady Eleanor and
      Helen&rsquo;s fate was, in reality, a heavier stroke of fortune. Lionel was a
      soldier, ardent and daring, fond of his profession, and far more ambitious
      of distinction than attached to the life of pleasure a court and a great
      capital suggested; but they who had never known the want of every luxury
      that can embellish life, whose whole existence had been like some fairy
      dream of pleasure, how were they to bear up against the dreadful shock?
      Lady Eleanor&rsquo;s health was frail and delicate in the extreme; Helen&rsquo;s
      attachment to her mother such that any impression on her would invariably
      recoil upon herself. What might be the consequences of the disclosure to
      them Darcy could not, dared not, contemplate.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he revolved all these things in his mind, and thought upon the
      difficulties that beset him, he was at a loss whether to deplore the
      necessity of wearing a false face of pleasure a few days longer, or
      rejoice at the occasion of even this brief reprieve from ruin. Thus passed
      the weary hours that preceded daybreak, and while others slept soundly, or
      reviewed in their dreams the pleasures of the past night, Darcy&rsquo;s gloomy
      thoughts were fixed upon the inevitable calamity of his fate, and the
      years, few but sad, that in all likelihood were now before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stir and bustle of the servants preparing breakfast for the hunting
      party broke in upon his dreary revery, and he suddenly bethought him of
      the part he had assigned himself to play. He dreaded the possibility of an
      interview with Lady Eleanor, in which she would inevitably advert to
      Gleeson, and the circumstances of his flight; this could not be avoided,
      however, were he to pass the day at home, and so he resolved to join the
      hunting-field, where perhaps some lingering trace of his old enthusiasm
      for the sport might lead him to hope for a momentary relief of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lionel, too, will be glad to see me in the saddle&mdash;it&rsquo;s some years
      since I crossed the sward at a gallop&mdash;and I am curious to know if a
      man&rsquo;s nerve is stouter when the world looks fair before him, or when the
      night of calamity is lowering above his head.&rdquo; Muttering these words to
      himself, he passed out into the hall, and crossing which, entered the
      courtyard, and took his way towards the stables. It was still dark, but
      many lights were moving to and fro, and the groom population were all
      about and stirring. Darcy opened the door and looked down the long range
      of stalls, where above twenty saddle-horses were now standing, the greater
      number of them highly bred and valuable animals, and all in the highest
      possible condition. Great was the astonishment of the stablemen as the
      Knight moved along, throwing a glance as he went at each stall, while a
      muttered &ldquo;Welcome home to yer honor&rdquo; ran from mouth to mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bastes is looking finely, sir,&rdquo; said Bob Carney, who, as stud-groom
      and huntsman, had long presided over his department.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they are, Bob, but I don&rsquo;t know half of them; where did this strong
      brown horse come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Clipper, yer honor; I knew you wouldn&rsquo;t know him. He took up
      finely after his run last winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the fore leg, is it strong again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As stout as a bar of iron; one of the boys had him out two days ago, and
      he took the yellow ditch flying: we measured nineteen feet between the
      mark of his hoofs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to be strong enough to carry me, Bob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ride him, sir, he&rsquo;s an uncertain divil; and though he &lsquo;ll go
      straight over everything for maybe twenty minutes or half an hour, he &lsquo;ll
      stop short at a drain not wider than a potato furrow, and the power of man
      would n&rsquo;t get him over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a smart gray yonder,&mdash;what is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the one we tried as a leader one day; yer honor remembers you bid
      me shoot her, or get rid of her, for she kicked the traces, and nearly the
      wheel-horse, all to smash; and now she&rsquo;s the sweetest tiling to ride, for
      eleven stone, in the whole country. There&rsquo;s an English colonel to try her
      to-day; my only advice to him is, let her have her own way of it, for, if
      he begins pulling at her, &lsquo;t is maybe in Donegal he &lsquo;ll be before
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what have you for me?&rdquo; said the Knight; &ldquo;for I scarcely know any of
      my old friends here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the mouse-colored cob&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the Knight, laughing; &ldquo;I want to keep my place, Bob. You
      must give me something better than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, an&rsquo; your honor might have worse; but if it&rsquo;s for riding you are,
      take Black Peter, and you &lsquo;ll never find the fence too big, or the ground
      too heavy for him. I was going to give him to the English lord; I suppose,
      after all, he &lsquo;ll be better pleased with the cob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Peter for me. And now let&rsquo;s see what Mr. Lionel has to ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There she is, and a beauty!&rdquo; said Bob, as, with a dexterous jerk, he
      chucked a sheet off her haunches, and displayed the shining flanks and
      splendid proportions of a thoroughbred mare. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Cushleen,&rdquo; said he,
      as he fixed his eyes on the Knight&rsquo;s face to enjoy the reflection of his
      own delight. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the darlin&rsquo; can do it!&mdash;a child can hould her,
      but it takes a man to sit on her back&mdash;racing speed over a flat, and
      a jump!&mdash;&lsquo;t is more like the bound of a football than anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has the eye of a hot one, Bob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why would n&rsquo;t she? But she knows when to be so. Let her take her
      place at the head of the whole field, with a light finger to guide and a
      stout heart to direct her, and she&rsquo;s a kitten; but the divil a tiger was
      ever as fierce if another passes her, or a cowardly hand would try to hold
      her back. And there &lsquo;s a nate tool, that black horse,&mdash;that &lsquo;s for
      another of the English gentlemen. Master Lionel calls him Sir Harry. They
      tell me he &lsquo;s a fine rider, and has a pack of hounds himself in his own
      place, and I am mistaken if he has the baste in his stable will give him a
      betther day&rsquo;s sport. The chestnut here is for Miss Helen, for she&rsquo;s coming
      to see them throw off, and it&rsquo;ll be a fine sight; we &lsquo;ll be thirty-six out
      of your honor&rsquo;s stables, Mr. Conolly is bringing nine more, and all the
      Martins, and the Lynches, and Dalys, and Mr. Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly and his son,&mdash;though,
      to be sure, <i>they</i> won&rsquo;t do much for the honor of ould Ireland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Knight turned away laughing, and re-entered the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early as it yet was, the inmates of the abbey were stirring, and a great
      breakfast, laid for above thirty, was prepared in the library, for the
      supper-tables occupied the dining-rooms, and the débris of the magnificent
      entertainment of the night before still lingered there. Two cheerful fires
      blazed on the ample hearths, and threw a mellow lustre over that spacious
      room, where old Tate now busied himself in those little harmless duties he
      fancied indispensable to the Knight&rsquo;s comfort, for the poor fellow, on
      hearing of his master&rsquo;s return, had once more resumed his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knight&rsquo;s meeting with him was one of true friendship; difference of
      station interposed no barrier to affection, and Darcy shook the old man&rsquo;s
      hand as cordially as though they were brothers. Yet each was sad with a
      secret sorrow, which all their efforts could scarce conceal from the
      other. In vain the Knight endeavored to turn away old Tate&rsquo;s attention by
      inquiries after his health, questions about home, or little flatteries
      about his preparations, Tate&rsquo;s filmy eyes were fixed upon his master with
      a keenness that age could not dim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;T is maybe tired your honor is,&rdquo; said he, in a voice half meant as
      inquiry, half insinuation; &ldquo;the Parliament, they tell me, destroys the
      health entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, Tate; late hours, heated rooms, and some fatigue will not
      serve a man of my age; but I am tolerably well for all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God be praised for it!&rdquo; said Tate, piously, but in a voice that showed it
      was rather a wish he expressed than a conviction, when, suspecting that he
      had suffered some portion of his fears to escape, he added more
      cheerfully, &ldquo;And is n&rsquo;t Master Lionel grown an iligant, fine young man!
      When I seen him comin&rsquo; up the stairs, it was just as if the forty-eight
      years that&rsquo;s gone over was only a dhrame, and I was looking at your honor
      the day you came home from college; he has the same way with bis arms, and
      carries his head like you, and the same light step. Musha!&rdquo; muttered he,
      below his breath, &ldquo;the ould families never die out, but keep their looks
      to the last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fine fellow, Tate!&rdquo; said the Knight, turning towards the window,
      for, while flattered by the old man&rsquo;s praises of his son, a deep pang shot
      through his heart at the wide disparity of fortune with which life opened
      for both of them. At the instant an arm was drawn round him, and Helen
      stood at his side: she was in her riding-habit, and looking in perfect
      beauty. Darcy gazed at her for a few seconds, and with such evident
      admiration that she, as if accepting the compliment, drew herself up, and,
      smiling, said, &ldquo;Yes, nothing short of conquest. Lionel told his friends to
      expect a very unformed country girl; they shall see at least she can
      ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No harebrained risks, Helen, dearest. I&rsquo;m to take the field to-day, and
      you must n&rsquo;t shake my nerve; for I want to bring no disgrace on my
      county.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was but jesting, my own dear papa,&rdquo; said she, drawing closer to him;
      &ldquo;but I really felt so curious to see these English horsemen&rsquo;s performance
      that I asked Lionel to train Alice for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Lionel, of course, but too happy to show his pretty sister&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, if you will quiz, I must only confess that my head is quite
      turned already; our noble cousin overwhelms me with flatteries which, upon
      the principle the Indian accepts glass beads and spangles as gems, and
      gold, I take as real value. But here he comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Lord Netherby, attired for the field in all the accuracy of costume,
      slipped towards them. After came Colonel Crofton, a well-known fashionable
      of the clubs and a hanger-on of the peer; then Sir Harry Beauclerk, a
      young baronet of vast fortune, gay, good-tempered, and extravagant; while
      several others of lesser note, brother officers of Lionel&rsquo;s and men about
      town, brought up the rear, one only deserving remark, a certain Captain,
      or, as he was better known, Tom Nolan,&mdash;a strange, ambiguous kind of
      fellow, always seen in the world, constantly met at the best houses, and
      yet nobody being able to explain why he was asked, nor&mdash;as it very
      often happened&mdash;who asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Eleanor never appeared early in the day, but there was a sprinkling
      of lady-visitors through the room, guests at the abbey: a very pretty, but
      not over-afflicted widow, a Mrs. Somerville, with several Mrs. and Miss
      Lynches, Brownes, and Martins, comprising the beauties of the
      neighborhood. Lionel was the last to make his appearance, so many
      directions had he to give about earth-stoppers and cover-hacks, drags,
      phaetons, fresh horses, and all the contingent requirements of a day&rsquo;s
      sport. Besides, he had pledged himself most faithfully to give Mrs.
      Somerville&rsquo;s horse, a very magnificent barb, a training canter himself,
      with a horse-sheet round his legs, for she was a timid rider,&mdash;on
      some occasions,&mdash;though certain calumnious people averred that, when
      alone, she would take any fence in the whole barony.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they were seated, and such a merry, happy party! There was but
      one sad heart in the company, and that none could guess at. And what a
      running fire of pleasant raillery rattled round the table! How brimful of
      wit and good-humor were they all! How ready each to take the jest against
      himself, and even heighten its flavor by some new touch of drollery.
      Harmless wagers respecting the places they would occupy at the finish,
      gentle quiz-zings about safe riding through the gaps, and joking counsels
      as to the peculiar difficulties of an Irish country, were heard on all
      sides; while the Knight recounted the Galway anecdote of Dick Perse taking
      an immense leap and disappearing afterwards. &ldquo;&lsquo;Call the ground, Dick!&rsquo;
      cried Lord Clanricarde, who was charging up at top speed&mdash;&lsquo;call the
      ground! What&rsquo;s at the other side?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I <i>am</i>, thank God!&rsquo; was the short reply, and the words came from
      the depth of a gravel-pit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last, venison pasties and steaks, rolls and coffee, with their due
      accompaniment of liqueurs, came to an end, and a very sufficient uproar
      without, of men, dogs, and horses commingled, bespoke the activity of
      preparation there, while old Bob Carney&rsquo;s voice topped every other, as he
      swore at or commended men and beasts indiscriminately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a glorious morning for our sport!&rdquo; said the Knight, as he threw open
      the sash, and let into the room the heavy perfume of the earth, borne on a
      southerly wind. The sea was calm as an inland lake, and the dark clouds
      over it were equally motionless. &ldquo;We shall be unlucky, my Lord, if we do
      not show you some sport on such a day. Ah, there go the dogs!&rdquo; And, as he
      spoke, the hounds issued from beneath the deep arch of the gateway, and
      with Bob and the whipper-in at their head, took their way across the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To horse! to horse!&rdquo; shouted Lionel, gayly, from the courtyard, for the
      riding party were not to proceed to the cover by the short path the hounds
      were gone, but to follow by a more picturesque and circuitous route.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope sincerely that beast is not intended for me,&rdquo; said Lord Netherby,
      as a powerful black horse crossed the courtyard, in a series of bounds,
      and finished by landing the groom over his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fear, my Lord,&rdquo; said Lionel, laughing; &ldquo;Billy Pitt is meant for
      Beauclerk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surely never named that animal after the minister, Knight?&rdquo; said his
      Lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my Lord,&rdquo; said Darcy, with a smile; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just as unsafe to back one
      as the other. But here comes the heavy brigade. Which is your choice,&mdash;Black
      Peter, or Mouse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I may choose, I will confess this is more to my liking than anything I
      have seen yet. You know that I don&rsquo;t mean to take any part in the debate,
      so I may as well secure a quiet seat under the gallery. But, my dear Miss
      Darcy, what a mettlesome thing you &lsquo;ve got there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s only fidgety; if I can hold her when they throw off, I &lsquo;ll have no
      trouble afterwards.&rdquo; And the graceful girl sat back easily in her saddle
      as the animal bounded and swerved with every stroke of her long
      riding-habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes Beauclerk!&rdquo; cried Lionel, as the young baronet shot like an
      arrow through the archway on the back of Billy Pitt; for no sooner had he
      touched the saddle than the unmanageable animal broke away from the
      groom&rsquo;s hands, and set off at full speed down the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Darcy,&rdquo; cried Colonel Crofton, &ldquo;is n&rsquo;t Beauclerk a step over you
      in the &lsquo;Army List&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lionel never heard the question, for he was most busily occupied about
      Mrs. Somerville and her horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who drives the phaeton?&mdash;where&rsquo;s a safe whip to be found for Mrs.
      Martin?&rdquo; said the Knight; and, seizing on a young Guardsman, he promoted
      him to the box, with a very pretty girl beside him. A drag, with four
      grays, was filling at the same instant, with a mixed population of
      horsemen and spectators, among whom Captain Nolan seemed the presiding
      spirit, as, seated beside a brother officer of Lionel&rsquo;s on the box, he
      introduced the several parties to each other, and did &ldquo;the honors&rdquo; of the
      conveyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Troops of horses, sheeted and hooded, now passed out with a number of
      grooms and stable-boys, on their way to cover; and at last the great
      cavalcade moved forward, the Knight, his daughter, and Lord Netherby gayly
      cantering on the grass, to permit the carriages to take the road. The drag
      came last; and although but newly met, the company were already in the
      full enjoyment of that intimacy which high spirits and pleasure beget,
      while Tom Nolan contributed his utmost to the merriment by jests which
      lost nothing of their poignancy from any scruples of their maker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There they go at last,&rdquo; said he, as Lionel and Mrs. Somerville cantered
      forth, followed by two grooms. &ldquo;I never heard of a stirrup so hard to
      arrange as that, in all my life!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX. THE HUNT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The cover lay in a small valley, almost deep enough to be called a glen,
      watered by a stream which in winter and summer took the alternate
      character of torrent or rivulet; gently sloping hills rose on either side,
      their banks clad with low furze and fern, and behind them a wide plain
      extended to the foot of the great mountains of Connemara.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both sides of the little glen were now occupied by groups on foot or
      horseback, as each calculated on the likelihood of the fox taking this
      direction or that. On the narrow road which led along the crest of the
      lower hill were many equipages to be seen, some of which were filled with
      ladies, whose waving feathers and gay colors served to heighten the effect
      of the landscape. The horsemen were dotted about, some on the ridge of the
      rising ground, some lower down on the sloping sides, and others walked
      their horses through the dense cover, watching as the dogs sprang and
      bounded from copse to copse, and made the air vibrate with their deep
      voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrival of the Knight&rsquo;s party created no slight sensation as carriages
      and horsemen came dashing up the hill, and took their station on an
      eminence, from whence all who were not mounted might have a view of the
      field. No sooner was he recognized, than such as had the honor of personal
      acquaintance moved forward to pay their respects and welcome him home
      again; among whom Beecham O&rsquo;Reilly appeared, but with such evident
      diffidence of manner and reserve that Darcy, from motives of delicacy, was
      forced to take a more than ordinary notice of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were sorry not to have your company at the abbey last night; you &lsquo;ve
      had a cold, I hear,&rdquo; said the Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; this is the first day I&rsquo;ve ventured out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me introduce you to Lord Netherby. One of our foremost riders, my
      Lord, Mr. Beecham O&rsquo;Reilly. You may see that the merit is not altogether
      his own,&mdash;splendid horse you have there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very powerful,&rdquo; said the young man, accepting the praise with an air
      of easy indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my country,&rdquo; interposed Lord Netherby, &ldquo;we should value him at three
      hundred guineas, if his performance equal his appearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Lionel, come here a moment,&rdquo; cried the Knight. &ldquo;What do you think
      of that horse?&mdash;but don&rsquo;t you know your old playfellow, Beecham? Have
      you both forgotten each other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Beecham? I&rsquo;d never have guessed you. To be sure, it is six
      years since we met. You were in Dublin, I think, when I was over on leave
      last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, at Oxford,&rdquo; said Beecham, with a slight flush as he spoke; for
      although he accepted the warm shake-hands Lionel proffered, his manner was
      one of constraint all through. Young Darcy was, however, too much occupied
      in admiring the horse to bestow much attention on the rider.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He &lsquo;d carry you well,&rdquo; said Beecham, as if interpreting what was passing
      in his mind, &ldquo;and as I have no fancy for him,&mdash;a worse horse will
      carry my weight as well,&mdash;I &lsquo;d sell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Netherby has valued him at three hundred,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;I
      gave nearly as much myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Knight, who heard this conversation, without being able to interrupt
      it, was in perfect misery. The full measure of his ruin rushed suddenly on
      his mind, and the thought that, at the very moment his son was meditating
      this piece of extravagance, he was himself actually a beggar, sickened him
      to the heart. Meanwhile, Lionel walked his horse slowly round, the better
      to observe the animal he coveted, and then cantered back to his place at
      Mrs. Somerville&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beecham seemed to hesitate for a second or two, then, riding forward, he
      approached Lionel: &ldquo;Perhaps you would try him to-day, Captain Darcy?&rdquo; The
      words came hesitatingly and with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! he &lsquo;s beyond my reach,&rdquo; said Lionel, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d really take it as a favor if you would ride him; I &lsquo;m not strong
      enough to hold him, consequently cannot do him justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the offer, Darcy,&rdquo; said Lord Netherby, in a whisper, as he rode up
      to his side; &ldquo;I have a great liking for that horse myself, and will buy
      him if you report favorably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, my Lord, I&rsquo;ll do it with pleasure. I accept your kind
      proposal, and will change nags if you agree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beecham at once dismounted, and, beckoning to his servant, ordered him to
      change the saddles.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this little scene was enacting, old Conolly rode up to the Knight,
      with a warning to keep the ladies in the road. &ldquo;The fox will take the
      country towards Burnadarig,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;the start&rsquo;s with the wind; and as
      the fences are large and the ground heavy, they had better not attempt to
      follow the run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will take your advice, Tom,&rdquo; said the Knight. &ldquo;Come here, Helen&mdash;Colonel
      Crofton, will you kindly bring Mrs. Somerville up here, and tell Lord
      Netherby to join us&mdash;the day will be for the fast ones only. There
      they go,&mdash;are they off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, not yet,&rdquo; said Conolly, as, standing in his stirrups, he looked
      down into the glen; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re hunting him through the furze cover this half
      hour. I know that fox well; he never breaks till the dogs are actually on
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the scene in the valley was becoming highly exciting; the
      hounds, yelping and barking, bounded hither and thither; some, with
      uplifted throats, bayed deeply a long, protracted note; others, with noses
      to the earth, ran swiftly along, and then, stopping, burst into a sharp
      cry, as if of pain, while old Bob Carney&rsquo;s voice, encouraging this one,
      and cursing that, was high above the tumult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tiresome work, this is,&rdquo; said Sir Harry Beauclerk; for his horse, mad
      with impatience, was white with sweat, and trembled in every limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have it very soon, sir,&rdquo; said old Conolly; &ldquo;the dogs are together
      now. I wish that young gentleman there would move a little up the hill.&rdquo;
       This was said of a young officer who took his station at the exit of the
      cover. &ldquo;There they go, now! Tally-ho!&rdquo; cried he, in ecstasy, and the shout
      re-echoed from a hundred voices, as the hounds, in full cry, burst from
      the cover, and were seen, in one compact mass, rising the opposite hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a second every horse was away, save that little group around the
      Knight, and which, notwithstanding all the efforts of the servants,
      bounded and plunged in mad impatience. Beauclerk was the first down the
      hill, and over the brook, which he cleared gallantly. Conolly followed
      close; and then came Crofton in a group of others, among whom rode
      O&rsquo;Reilly, all riding well and safely; and last of all was Lionel, mounted
      on the brown thoroughbred, and holding him together, in spite of all his
      eagerness to get on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knight forgot everything that lay heavily on his heart as he watched
      his son nearing the brook, which he took flying. &ldquo;He knows his horse; now!
      see!&rdquo; cried Darcy, as his whole face beamed with enthusiastic delight;
      &ldquo;look a little this way, my dear Mrs. Somerville, Lionel&rsquo;s gaining on
      them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Somerville scarcely needed the direction, for, notwithstanding her
      horse&rsquo;s plunging, she had never taken her glass from her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that a wall on the side of the hill? I really believe it is!&rdquo; said
      Lord Netherby, with an accent of amazement and horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A stone wall, and a stout one. I know it well,&rdquo; said Darcy. &ldquo;There goes
      Sir Harry Beauclerk at it. Too fast, sir! too fast!&rdquo; screamed out the
      Knight, as if his advice could be heard and followed at that distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s down! he&rsquo;s down!&rdquo; cried several voices together, as horse and rider
      balanced for a second on the top, and rolled headlong on the opposite
      side, while Helen grasped her father&rsquo;s arm, but never uttered a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His horse is away&mdash;there he goes!&mdash;but the young man is on his
      legs again!&rdquo; called out the Knight; &ldquo;see how the rest are scattering now&mdash;they
      &lsquo;ve no fancy for it;&rdquo; for so it was, Beauclerk&rsquo;s catastrophe, mounted, as
      they knew him to be, on one of the most perfect of hunters, had terrified
      the field, and they broke up into different groups, searching an exit
      where they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he goes,&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way to take it!&rdquo; cried Darcy, as Lionel,
      emerging from the little valley, was seen ascending the hill in a sharp
      canter; &ldquo;see, my Lord! Do you mark how he holds his horse together? The
      hind legs are well forward&mdash;beautifully done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, beautifully done!&rdquo; re-echoed Mrs. Somerville, as the young man, with
      one cut of his whip, rose the horse to the wall, topped, poised for an
      instant on its summit, and bounded down with the seeming lightness of a
      bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all together again,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;Mr. Conolly has found a gap,
      and there they go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments the whole field were in sight, as they rode in a waving
      line, only a few stragglers in their rear; but the gradual dip of the
      ground soon hid them from view, and nothing remained save the occasional
      glance of a red coat as some rider, &ldquo;thrown out&rdquo; for a moment, sought to
      recover his place by an adroit &ldquo;cast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we are not destined to see much more of the day&rsquo;s sport?&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Somerville, with a pouting look; for she would infinitely rather have
      braved all the hazards of the field than have remained behind with the
      spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust we shall have another peep at them,&rdquo; said the Knight. &ldquo;By
      following this by-road to Burris Hill, the chances are that we see them
      winding along at our feet; the fox generally runs from this cover to the
      scrub beneath Nephin. We may go slowly, for if I be right in my
      calculation, they have a wide circuit to make yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Knight, after a few words to the parties in the carriage, took the
      lead with Lord Netherby, while Mrs. Somerville and Helen followed, an
      indiscriminate crowd of carriages and horsemen bringing up the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was an arrangement artfully accomplished by the Earl, who had been
      most impatiently awaiting some opportunity of conferring with the Knight
      on the question of politics, and ascertaining how far he himself might
      adventure on claiming the merit of converting him, when he returned to
      England. He had already remarked that Darcy&rsquo;s name did not appear in the
      division on the second reading of the Bill of Union, and the fact seemed
      so far indicative of a disposition not to oppose the Government. The
      subject was one to be approached with skill, and it was at last by an
      adroit congratulation on the pleasant contrast of a country life with the
      fatigues of Parliament, that he opened the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, my Lord,&rdquo; said the Knight, laughing, &ldquo;that Irish gentlemen are
      very likely to enjoy in future a fair proportion of that agreeable
      retirement you have so justly lauded. The wisdom of our rulers has thought
      fit to relieve us of the burden of self-government in Parliament, and left
      us, if we can succeed in effecting it, to govern ourselves at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be unquestionably the lot of many, Knight. I am quite aware
      that men of second-rate importance will no longer possess any at all; but
      estated gentlemen, of high position and liberal fortunes, like yourself,
      for instance, will not lose their influence by the greater extent of the
      field in which it is exercised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darcy sighed, but made no reply; the thought of his utter ruin came too
      painfully across him to permit of an answer. Lord Netherby interpreted his
      silence as doubt, and continued: &ldquo;You are unjust, not only to yourself,
      but to us, by any discredit of this point. Men of real knowledge about
      Ireland and her interests will have a greater position than ever they
      enjoyed before; no longer buried and lost among the impracticable horde of
      theorists and false patriots of a Dublin Parliament, they will be known
      and appreciated by a deliberative assembly where the greatest men of the
      empire hold council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am forced to differ with you on every point, my Lord,&rdquo; said the Knight,
      calmly; &ldquo;we are united to England, not that we may make an integral
      portion of your empire, but simply that we may be more easily governed. Up
      to this hour, you have ruled this country through the instrumentality of
      certain deputed individuals here amongst us; your system has had but
      indifferent success. You are now about to try another method, and govern
      us through the means of Party. Into the subdivisions of these parties
      Irishmen will fall,&mdash;with such success, personally, as their
      abilities and weight may obtain for them; but Party, I assert, will now
      rule Ireland, not with any regard to Irish interests or objects, but
      simply to put this man into power, and to put that man out. Now I, my
      Lord, humble as my station is, have no fancy for such contests as these,&mdash;contests
      in which the advantages of my country will always be subordinate to some
      Cabinet intrigue or Ministerial stratagem. To-day, the Government may find
      it suit their views to administer the affairs of Ireland ably, justly, and
      fearlessly; to-morrow, a powerful faction may spring up here, who, by
      intimidation without, and by votes within the House, shall be able to
      thwart the administration in their Home measures. What will happen then?
      This faction will be bought off. By concessions to them <i>in Ireland</i>,
      they will obtain all their demands, for the sake of pliancy about
      interests of which they care little, and know nothing. This will succeed
      for a time; the &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Government&rsquo; will go well and flippantly on; you
      may tax the people, promote your followers, and bully your opponents to
      your heart&rsquo;s content: but, meanwhile, Ireland will be gaining on you; your
      allies, grown exacting by triumph, will ask more than you dare, or even
      have, to give; and the question will then arise, that the party who
      aspires to power must bid for it by further concession; and who is to
      vouch for the moderation of such demands, or what limit will there be to
      them? I see a train of such evils in the vista; and although I neither
      pretend to think our domestic legislature safe nor faultless, I think the
      dangers we have before us are even greater than such as would spring from
      an Irish Parliament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Netherby listened with great impatience&mdash;as perhaps the reader
      may have done also&mdash;to this declaration of the Knight&rsquo;s views, and
      was about to reply, when suddenly a cheer from some country people,
      stationed on a rocky height at a short distance, drew all eyes towards the
      valley, where now the hounds were seen in full cry, three horsemen alone
      following. One of these was the huntsman; Lionel another; the third was in
      plain clothes, and not known to any of the party. He was mounted on a
      powerful horse, and even at that distance could be seen to manage him with
      the address of a perfect rider. The rest of the field were far behind,
      some still standing on the verge of a mountain torrent, which appeared to
      have formed the obstacle to the run, and into which more than one seemed
      to have fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Groups were gathered here and there along the bank, and dismounted horses
      galloped wildly to and fro, showing that the catastrophes had been
      numerous. While Lord Netherby looked with some alarm at the fearful chasm
      which had arrested all but three out of the entire field, the Knight
      followed Lionel with anxious eyes, as he led over the most desperate line
      of country in the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew a fox take that line but once,&rdquo; said Darcy, pointing to a
      wide expanse of bleak country, which stretched away to the base of the
      great mountain of Nephin. &ldquo;I was a child at the time, but I remember the
      occurrence well; horse, men, and hounds tailed off one by one, some sorely
      injured, others dead beat, for the fellow was a most powerful dog-fox, and
      ran straight ahead for thirty-four miles of a desperate country. The
      following morning, at a little after daybreak, the fox was seen in a half
      trot near Ballycroy, still followed by two of the dogs, and he lived many
      years afterwards as a pensioner at the abbey; the dogs were never worth
      anything from that day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the Knight related this anecdote, the hounds and the hunters were
      gradually receding from view; and although at intervals some thought they
      could catch glimpses of them, at last they disappeared altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, Helen,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;that our visitors should have been
      so unfortunate in their sport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am more grieved to think that Lionel should follow over such a
      country,&rdquo; said Lord Netherby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s well mounted, my Lord; and though many would call him a reckless
      rider, he has as much judgment as he has daring. I am tolerably easy about
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen did not seem so confident as her father; and as for Mrs. Somerville,
      she was considerably paler than usual, and managed her mettlesome horse
      with far less than her customary address.
    </p>
    <p>
      As well to meet their friends who were thrown out, as to show some of the
      scenery of the coast, the Knight proposed they should retrace their steps
      for a short distance, and take a view of the bay on their way back to the
      abbey. Leaving them, therefore, to follow their route, and not delaying
      our reader by an account of the various excuses of the discomfited, or the
      banterings of Tom Nolan, we will turn to the wide plain, where, still in
      full cry, the dogs pursued their game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knight had not exaggerated when calling it a dreadful country to ride
      over; yawning trenches, deep enough to engulf horse and rider, were cut in
      the bog, and frequently so close together that, in clearing one, a few
      strides more presented another; the ground itself, only in part reclaimed,
      was deep and heavy, demanding great strength both of horse and horseman.
      Through this dangerous and intricate track the fox serpentined and wound
      his way with practised cunning, while at every turning some unlucky hound
      would miss his spring, or lose his footing in the slippery soil, and their
      cries could be heard far over the plain, as they struggled in vain to
      escape from a deep trench. It was in such an endeavor that a hound was
      catching at the bank with his fore-legs, as the huntsman dashed forward to
      take the leap; the horse, suddenly taking fright, swerved, and, before he
      could recover, the frail ground gave way, and the animal plunged headlong
      down, fortunately flinging bis rider over the head on the opposite bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All safe, Bob?&rdquo; cried Lionel, as he turned in his saddle. But he had no
      time for more, for the strange rider was fast nearing on him, and the
      chase had now become a trial of speed and skill. By degrees they emerged
      from this unsafe tract and gained the grass country, where high ditches
      and stone walls presented a more fair, but scarcely less dangerous, kind
      of fencing. Here the stranger made an effort to pass Lionel and take the
      lead, and more than once they took their leaps exactly side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they rode along close to each other, Lionel from time to time caught
      glimpses of his companion, who was a strong-built man of five-and-thirty,
      frank and fresh-looking, but clearly not of the rank of gentleman. His
      horse was a powerful thoroughbred, with more bone than is usually found in
      Irish breeding, and trained to perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re coming near the Crumpawn river; that
      line of mist yonder is over the torrent. I warn you, the leap is a big
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lionel turned a haughty glance towards the man, for there was a tone of
      assumed superiority in the words he could ill brook. That instant,
      however, his eyes were directed to the front, where the roaring of a
      mountain stream mingled with the sharp cry of the hounds as they struggled
      in the torrent, or fell back in their efforts to climb the steep bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ride him fairly at it,&mdash;no flinching; and d&mdash;&mdash;me if I
      care what your father was, I&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;re a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lionel bit his lip almost through with passion; and, had the occasion
      permitted, the heavy stroke of his whip had fallen on a very different
      quarter from his horse&rsquo;s flank; but he never uttered a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Badly done! Never punish your horse at the stride!&rdquo; said the fellow, who
      seemed bent on provoking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lionel bounded in his saddle at this taunt on his riding; but there was no
      time for bandying words of anger; the roar of rushing water, and the misty
      foam, proclaimed the torrent near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best man is first over!&rdquo; shouted the stranger, as he rushed at the
      terrific chasm. Lionel dashed forward; so close were they, they could have
      touched; when, with a wild cheer, the stranger gave his horse a tremendous
      cut, and the animal bounded from the earth like a stag, and, soaring over
      the mad torrent, descended lightly on the sward beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lionel had lifted his horse at the very same instant; but the treacherous
      bank gave way beneath the animal&rsquo;s forelegs: he struggled dreadfully to
      regain his footing, and, half rearing and half backing, tried to retire;
      but the effort was in vain, the slippery earth carried him with it, and
      down both horse and rider came into the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep his head to the current, and sit steady!&rdquo; shouted the stranger, who
      now watched the struggle with breathless eagerness. &ldquo;Well done! well done!&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      press him, he &lsquo;ll do it himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The counsel was wise, for the noble animal needed neither spur nor whip,
      but breasted the white torrent with vigorous effort, sometimes plunging
      madly above, and again sinking, all save the head, beneath the flood. At
      last they reached the side, and the strong beast, with one bold spring,
      placed his fore-legs on the high bank. This was the most dangerous moment,
      for, unable to follow with his hind-legs, he stood opposed to the whole
      force of the current, that threatened every instant to engulf him.
      Lionel&rsquo;s efforts were tremendous; he lifted, he spurred, he strained, he
      shouted, but all in vain: the animal, worn out by exertion, faltered, and
      would have fallen back, when the stranger, springing from his saddle,
      leaned over the bank, and, seizing Lionel by the collar, jerked him from
      his horse. The beast, relieved of the weight, at once rallied and bounded
      up the bank, where Lionel now found himself, stunned, but not senseless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them say what they like,&rdquo; muttered the stranger, as he stood over
      him, &ldquo;you &lsquo;re a devilish fine young fellow! D&mdash;&mdash;me if I&rsquo;ll ever
      think so much about good blood again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lionel was too weak and too much exhausted to reply, and even his fingers
      could scarcely close upon the whip he tried to grasp; yet, for all that,
      the stranger&rsquo;s insolence sickened him to the very heart. Pride of race was
      the strongest feeling of his nature, and this fellow seemed determined to
      outrage it at every turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, take a pull at this; you &lsquo;ll be all right presently,&rdquo; said the man,
      as he presented a little leather flask to the youth&rsquo;s lips. But Lionel
      repulsed the offer rudely, and turned his head away. &ldquo;The more fool you!&rdquo;
       said he, coarsely; &ldquo;your grandfather mixed many a worse-flavored one, and
      charged more for it;&rdquo; and, so saying, he emptied the measure at a draught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lionel pondered on the words for some seconds, and suddenly the thought
      occurred to him that the stranger had mistaken him for another. &ldquo;Ah! I see
      it all now!&rdquo; thought he, and he turned his head to undeceive him; when,
      what was his surprise, as he looked up, to see that the fellow was gone.
      Mounted on his own horse, he was leading Lionel&rsquo;s by the bridle, and, at a
      smart trot, moving down the glen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man sprang to his feet and shouted aloud; he even tried to
      follow him; but both efforts were fruitless. At the turn of the road the
      man halted, and, looking round, waved his hat as in sign of adieu; then,
      moving forward, disappeared, while Lionel, his passion giving way to his
      sense of the absurdity of the whole adventure, burst into a fit of hearty
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll be laughed at to the day of my death about this,&rdquo; thought he, as he
      turned his steps to seek the path homeward on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in the evening when Lionel reached the abbey. The guests had
      for the most part left the dinner-room, and were dropping by twos and
      threes into the drawing-room, when he made his appearance in the midst of
      them, splashed and travel-stained from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      A burst of merry laughter rang out as they beheld his torn habiliments and
      mud-colored dress, in which none joined more heartily than the Knight
      himself, as he called aloud, &ldquo;Well, Lionel, did you kill him, boy, or run
      him to earth below Nephin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, sir! if old Carney is safe, I think nobody has been killed
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Bob is all right; he came back three hours ago. He has lamed
      Scaltheen; but she &lsquo;ll get over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your own adventures,&rdquo; interposed Lord Netherby; &ldquo;for so they ought to
      be, judging from the state of your toilet. Let us hear them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by all means,&rdquo; added Beauclerk; &ldquo;the huntsman says that the last he
      saw of you was riding by the side of some one in green, with three of the
      pack in front, the rest tailed off, and himself in a bog-hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there was no one in green in the field,&rdquo; said Crofton; &ldquo;at least I
      did not see any one riding, except the red coats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us not be too critical about the color of the dress,&rdquo; said Lord
      Netherby; &ldquo;I am sure it would puzzle any of us to pronounce on the exact
      hue of Lionel&rsquo;s at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Lionel, will you decide it?&rdquo; said the Knight; &ldquo;is the green man
      apocryphal, or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll decide nothing,&rdquo; said Lionel, &ldquo;till I get something to eat. Any one
      that wishes to hear my exploits must come into the dinner-room;&rdquo; and, so
      saying, he arose, and walked into the parlor, where, under Tate&rsquo;s
      superintendence, a little table was already spread for him beside the
      fire. To the tempting fare before him the young man devoted all the energy
      of a hunter&rsquo;s appetite, regardless of the crowd who had followed him from
      the drawing-room, and stood in a circle around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many were the jests, and sharp the raillery, on his singular appearance,
      and certainly it presented a most ludicrous contrast with the massive
      decorations of the table at which he sat, and the full dress of the party
      around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said Lord Netherby, &ldquo;seeing the King of France&mdash;when
      such a functionary existed&mdash;eat his dinner in public on the terrace
      of Versailles; but I confess, great as was my admiration of the monarch&rsquo;s
      powers, I think Lionel exceeds them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another leg?&rdquo; said Beauclerk, who, with knife and fork in hand, performed
      the duty of carver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you say another turkey?&rdquo; said Nolan; then, turning to Mrs.
      Somerville, he added, &ldquo;I am sure that negus is perfect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pretty widow, who had been contributing, as she thought unobserved, to
      Lionel&rsquo;s comfort, blushed deeply; and Lionel, at last roused from his
      apathy, said, &ldquo;I am ready now, ladies and gentlemen all, to satisfy every
      reasonable demand upon your curiosity. But first, where is Mr. Beecham
      O&rsquo;Reilly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went home,&rdquo; said the Knight; &ldquo;he resisted all my efforts to detain him
      to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he only came over to sell that horse,&rdquo; said Nolan, in a half
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had bought him, with all my heart,&rdquo; said Lionel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like him so much,&rdquo; said the Knight, with a meaning smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sincerely hope you do,&rdquo; said Lord Netherby, &ldquo;for he is yours already,&mdash;at
      least, if you will do me the honor to accept him; I often hoped to have
      mounted you one day&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept him, my Lord,&rdquo; interposed Lionel, &ldquo;most willingly and most
      gratefully. You have, literally speaking, mounted me &lsquo;one day,&rsquo; and I very
      much doubt if I ever mount the same animal another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! is he lame?&mdash;or staked?&mdash;did he break down?&mdash;is he a
      devil to ride?&rdquo; broke from several of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one of all these; but if you&rsquo;ll bestow five minutes&rsquo; patience on me I
      &lsquo;ll perhaps inform you of a mode of being unhorsed, novel at least to most
      fox-hunters.&rdquo; With this, Lionel narrated the conclusion of the run, the
      leap of the Crumpawn river, and the singular departure of his companion at
      the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this a practical joke, Knight?&rdquo; said Lord Netherby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so, my Lord; one of those admirable jests which the statutes
      record among their own Joe Millers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you suspect he was a robber?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess it looks very like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I read the riddle otherwise,&rdquo; said Lionel; &ldquo;the fellow, whoever he was,
      mistook me for somebody else, and there was evidently something more like
      a reprisal than a theft in the whole transaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have really lost him?&rdquo; said Beanclerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I assure you that I came home on foot, I hope that question is
      answered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! you have most singular ways of doing matters in this country,&rdquo;
       cried the colonel; &ldquo;but I suppose when a man is used to Ireland, he gets
      pretty much accustomed to hear of his horse being stolen away as well as
      the fox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! we&rsquo;ll chance upon him one of these days yet,&rdquo; said the Knight; &ldquo;I am
      half of Lionel&rsquo;s mind myself now,&mdash;the thing does not look like a
      robbery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no end of the eccentricity of these people,&rdquo; muttered Lord
      Netherby to himself; &ldquo;they can get into a towering passion and become half
      mad about trifles, but they take a serious loss as coolly as possible.&rdquo;
       And with this reflection on national character he moved into the
      drawing-room, where soon afterwards the party repaired to talk over
      Lionel&rsquo;s adventure, with every turn that fancy or raillery could give it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. BAGENAL DALY&rsquo;S VISITORS
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was at a late hour of a night, some days after this event occurred,
      that Bagenal Daly sat closeted with Darcy&rsquo;s lawyer, endeavoring, by deep
      and long thought, to rescue him from some at least of the perils that
      threatened him. Each day, since the Knight&rsquo;s departure, had added to the
      evil tidings of his fortune. While Gleeson had employed his powers of
      attorney to withdraw large sums from the banker&rsquo;s hands, no information
      could be had concerning the great loan he had raised from the London
      company, nor was there to be found among the papers left behind him the
      bond passed to Hickman, and which he should have received had the money
      been paid. That such was the case, Bagenal Daly firmly believed; the
      memorandum given him by Freney was corroborated by the testimony of the
      clerks in two separate banking-houses, who both declared that Gleeson drew
      these sums on the morning before he started for Kildare, and to one of
      Daly&rsquo;s rapid habits of judgment such evidence was quite conclusive. This
      view of the subject was, unhappily, not destined to continue undisturbed,
      for, on the very morning after the Knight&rsquo;s departure from Dublin, came a
      formal letter from Hickman&rsquo;s solicitor, demanding payment of the interest
      on the sum of seventy-four thousand eight hundred and twenty pounds, odd
      shillings, at five per cent, owing by seven weeks, and accompanying which
      was a notice of foreclosure of the mortgage on the ensuing 17th of March,
      in case the full sum aforesaid were not duly paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      To meet these demands Daly well knew Darcy had no disposable property; the
      large sums raised by Gleeson, at a lower rate of interest, were intended
      for that purpose; and although he persisted in believing that this debt,
      at least, was satisfied, the lawyer&rsquo;s opinion was strongly opposed to that
      notion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bicknell was a shrewd man, deep not only in the lore of his
      professional knowledge, but a keen scrutinizer of motives, and a
      far-seeing observer of the world. He argued thus: Gleeson would never have
      parted with such a sum on the eve of his own flight; a day was of no
      consequence, he could easily have put off the payment to Hickman to the
      time of the American ship&rsquo;s sailing&mdash;why, then, hand over so large an
      amount, all in his possession? It was strange, of course, what had become
      of the money; but then they heard that his servant had made his escape.
      Why might not he have possessed himself of it after his master&rsquo;s suicide?
      Who was to interfere or prevent it? Besides, if he had paid Hickman, the
      bond would, in all likelihood, be forthcoming; to retain possession of it
      could have been no object with Gleeson; he had met with nothing but kind
      and friendly treatment from Darcy, and was not likely to repay him by an
      act of useless, gratuitous cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the testimony of the bank clerks, it was as applicable to one view
      of the case as the other. Gleeson would, of course, draw out everything at
      his disposal; and although the sums tallied with those in the memorandum,
      that signified little, as they were the full amount in each banker&rsquo;s hands
      to the Knight&rsquo;s credit. Lastly, as to the memorandum, it was the only real
      difficulty in the case; but that paper might have been in Gleeson&rsquo;s
      possession, and in the course of business discussion either might have
      been dropped inadvertently, or have been given to Hickman as explaining
      the moneys already prepared for his acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bicknell&rsquo;s reasonings were confirmed by the application of Hickman&rsquo;s
      solicitors, who were men of considerable skill and great reputed caution.
      &ldquo;Harris and Long make no such mistakes as this, depend upon that, sir;
      they see their case very clearly, or would never adventure on such an
      application.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash;n their caution! The question is not of their shrewdness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it is, though; we are weighing probabilities: let us see to
      which side the balance inclines. Would they serve notice of foreclosure,
      not knowing whether or not we had the receipt in our possession? That is
      the whole matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to say what they would do, but I know well what I
      should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray what may that be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold possession of the abbey, stand fast by the old walls, call in the
      tenantry,&mdash;and they are ready to answer such a call at a moment, if
      need be,&mdash;and while I proclaimed to the wide world by what right I
      resisted, I &lsquo;d keep the place against any force they dared to bring. These
      are ticklish times, Bicknell; the Government have just cheated this
      country,&mdash;they &lsquo;d scarcely risk the hazard of a civil war for an old
      usurer,&mdash;old Hickman would be left to his remedies in Banco or
      Equity; and who knows what might turn up one day or other to strengthen
      the honest cause?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I scarcely concur in your suggestion, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How the devil should you? There are neither declarations to draw, nor
      affidavits to swear, no motions, nor rules, nor replies, no declarations,
      no special juries! No, Bicknell, I never suspected your approval of my
      plan. It would not cost a single skin of parchment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though Daly spoke this sarcasm bitterly, it produced no semblance of
      irritation in the man of law, who was composedly occupied in perusing a
      document before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made memoranda,&rdquo; said Bicknell, &ldquo;of certain points for counsel&rsquo;s
      opinion, and as soon as we can obtain some information as to the
      authenticity of young Darcy&rsquo;s signature, we shall see our way more
      clearly. The case is not only a complicated but a gloomy one; our
      antagonists are acute and wealthy, and I own to you the prospect is far
      from good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The better counsel mine,&rdquo; said Daly, sternly; &ldquo;I have little faith in the
      justice that hangs upon the intelligence of what you facetiously call
      twelve honest men; methinks the world is scarcely so well supplied with
      the commodity that they are sure to answer the call of the sheriff. It is
      probable, however,&mdash;nay, it is more than probable,&mdash;Darcy will
      be of your mind, and reject my advice; if so, there is nothing for it but
      the judge and jury, and he will be despoiled of his property by the law of
      the land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bicknell knew too well the eccentric nature of Daly&rsquo;s character, in which
      no feature was more prominent than his hatred of everything like the
      recognized administration of the law, to offer him any opposition, and
      merely repeating his previous determination to seek the advice of able
      counsel, he took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is some deep mystery in this business,&rdquo; said Daly to himself, as he
      paced the room alone; &ldquo;Bicknell is right in saying that Gleeson would not
      have committed an act of unnecessary cruelty, nor, if he had paid the
      money, would he have failed to leave the bond among his papers. Every
      circumstance of this fellow&rsquo;s flight is enveloped in doubt, and Freney,
      the only man who appears to have suspected his intention, by some
      mischance is not now to be found; Sandy has not succeeded in meeting with
      the boy, notwithstanding all his efforts. What can this be owing to? What
      machinery is at work here? Have the Hick-mans their share in this?&rdquo; Such
      were the broken sentences he muttered, as, in turn, suspicions tracked
      each other in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daly was far too rash, and too impetuous in temper, to be well qualified
      for an investigation of so much difficulty. Unable to weigh probabilities
      with calmness, he was always the victim of his own prejudices in favor of
      certain things and people; and to escape from the chaotic trouble of his
      own harassed thoughts, he was ever ready to adopt some headlong and
      desperate expedient, in preference to the quieter policy of more patient
      minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, faith,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my plan is the best after all; and who knows but
      by showing the bold front we may reduce old Hickman&rsquo;s pretensions, or at
      least make a compromise with him. There are plenty of arms and ammunition,&mdash;eight
      stout fellows would hold the inner gate tower against a battalion,&mdash;we
      could raise the country from Mur-risk to Killery Harbor; and one gun fired
      from the Boat Quay would bring the fishermen from Clare Island and Achill
      to the rescue,&mdash;we &lsquo;d soon make a signal they &lsquo;d recognize; old
      Hickman&rsquo;s house, with all its porticos and verandas, would burn like
      tinder. If they are for law, let them begin, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened as he spoke these words, and Sandy entered cautiously.
      &ldquo;There is a countryman without wha says he&rsquo;s come a long way to see your
      honor, and maun see you this night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fra&rsquo; the West, I think, for he said the roads were heavy down in them
      parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him come in,&rdquo; said Daly; and, with his hands crossed behind his back,
      he continued to walk the room. &ldquo;Some poor fellow for a renewal of his
      lease, or an abatement, or something of that kind,&mdash;they &lsquo;ll never
      learn that I &lsquo;m no longer the owner of that estate that still bears my
      name, and they cling to me as though I had the power to assist them, when
      I&rsquo;m defenceless for myself. Well, what is it? Speak out, man,&mdash;what
      do you want with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The individual to whom this question was addressed stood with his back to
      the door, which he had cautiously shut close on entering, but, instead of
      returning an answer to the question, he cast a long and searching glance
      around the room, as if to ascertain whether any other person was in it.
      The apartment was large, and, being dimly lighted, it took some time to
      assure him that they were alone; but when he had so satisfied himself-, he
      walked slowly forward into the light, and, throwing open his loose coat of
      gray frieze, exhibited the well-known figure of Freney the robber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Freney!&mdash;the man of all Ireland I wish to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so, sir,&rdquo; said the other, wiping his forehead with his hand,
      for he was flushed and heated, and seemed to have come off a long journey.
      &ldquo;I know you sent for me, but I was unable to meet your messenger, and I
      can seldom venture to send that young villain Jemmy into the capital,&mdash;the
      police are beginning to know him, and he &lsquo;ll be caught one of these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were n&rsquo;t in Kildare, then?&rdquo; said Daly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I was in the far West,&mdash;down in Mayo. I had a little
      business in Ballina a short time back, and some fellow who knew me, and
      thought the game a safe one, stole my brown horse out of the inn-stable,
      in the broad noon-day, and sold him at the fair green at Ballinasloe. When
      I tell you that he was the best animal I ever crossed, I need n&rsquo;t say what
      the loss was to me; the nags you saw were broken-down hackneys in
      comparison. He was strong in bone and untiring, and I kept him for the
      heavy country around Boyle and down by Longford. It is not once, nor
      twice, but a dozen times, Matchlock has saved me from a loop and a leap in
      the air; but the rascal that took him well knew the theft was safe,&mdash;Freney,
      the highwayman, could scarcely lodge informations with a magistrate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you never could hear traces of him?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, that I did, but it cost me
      time and trouble too. I found that he was twice sold within one week. Dean
      Harris bought him, and sold him the day after.&rdquo; Here Freney gave a low
      cunning laugh, while his eyes twinkled with malignant drollery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did n&rsquo;t think as highly of him as you did, Freney?&rdquo; &ldquo;Perhaps he had
      n&rsquo;t as good reason,&rdquo; said the robber, laughing. &ldquo;He was riding home from
      an early dinner with the bishop, and as he was cantering along the side of
      the road, a chaise with four horses came tearing past. Matchlock, true to
      his old instinct, but not knowing who was on his back, broke into a
      gallop, and in half a dozen strides brought the dean close up to the
      chaise window, when the traveller inside sent a bullet past his ear that
      very nearly made a vacancy in the best living of the diocese. As I said,
      sir, the dean had had enough of him; he sold him the next morning, and
      that day week he was bought by a young fellow in the West whom I found out
      to be a grandson of old Hickman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he able to ride a horse like this?&rdquo; said Daly, doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ride him?&mdash;ay; and never a man in the province brought a beast to a
      leap with a lighter hand and a closer seat in the saddle. We were side by
      side for three miles of a stiff country, and I don&rsquo;t believe I &lsquo;m much of
      a coward,&mdash;at any rate, I set very little value on my neck; but, I
      &lsquo;ll tell you what, sir, he pushed me hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was this, then? Had you a race together?&rdquo; &ldquo;It was something very like
      it, sir,&rdquo; said Freney, laughing; &ldquo;for when I reached Westport, I heard
      that young O&rsquo;Reilly was to ride a new brown horse that day with the
      hounds, and a great hunt was expected, to show some English gentlemen who
      were staying at Gwynne Abbey. So I went off early to Hooley&rsquo;s forge, near
      the cross-roads, to see the meet, and look out for my man. I did n&rsquo;t want
      any one to tell me which he was, for I &lsquo;d know Matchlock at half a mile
      distance. There he was, in splendid condition too, and looking as I never
      saw him look before; by my conscience, Mr. Daly, there&rsquo;s a wide difference
      between the life of a beast in the stables of a county member, and one
      that has to stretch his bones in the shealing of such as myself. My plan
      was to go down to the cover, and the moment the fox broke away, to drive a
      bullet through my horse&rsquo;s head, and be off as hard as I could; for, to
      tell you the truth, it was spite more than the value of him was grieving
      me; so I took my own horse by the bridle, and walked down to where they
      were all gathered. I was scarcely there when the dogs gave tongue, and
      away they went,&mdash;a grand sight it was, more than a hundred red-coats,
      and riding close every man of them. Just then, up comes Matchlock, and
      takes the fence into the field where I was standing, a stone wall and a
      ditch, his rider handling him elegantly, and with an easy smile, sitting
      down in his saddle as if it was child&rsquo;s play. Faith, I could n&rsquo;t bring
      myself to fire the shot, partly for the sake of the horse, more too,
      maybe, for the sake of the rider. &lsquo;I &lsquo;ll go a bit beside him,&rsquo; said I to
      myself; for it was a real pleasure to me to watch the way how both knew
      their business well. I &lsquo;m making a long story of it, but the end of it was
      this: I took the Crumpawn river just to dare him, and divil a bit but he
      fell in,&mdash;no fault of his, but the bank was rotten, and down they
      went; the young fellow had a narrow escape of it, but he got through it at
      last, and, as he lay on the grass more dead than alive, I saw Matchlock
      grazing just close to me. Temptations are bad things, Mr. Daly,
      particularly when a man has never trained himself off them; so I slipped
      the bridle over his head, and rode away with him beside me.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Carried him off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clean and clever; he&rsquo;s at the hall-door this minute: and, by the same
      token, sixty-four miles he has covered this day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one part of the whole story surprises me; it is that this
      fellow should have ridden so boldly and so well. I know such courage is
      often no more than habit: yet even that lower quality of daring I never
      should have given him credit for. Was he hurt by his fall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stunned, perhaps, but nothing the worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, enough of him. I wanted to see you, Freney, to learn anything
      you may know of this fellow Gleeson&rsquo;s flight. It&rsquo;s a sad affair for my
      friend the Knight of Gwynne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve heard, sir. It&rsquo;s bad enough for myself, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you! He was not your man of business, was he?&rdquo; said Daly, with a sly
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I generally manage my money matters myself; but he happened to
      have a butler, one Garrett by name, who betted smartly on the turf, and
      played a little with the bones besides. He was a steady-going chap that
      knew a thing or two, but honest enough in booking up when he lost; he
      borrowed two hundred from me on the very day they started; he owed me
      nearly three besides, and I never saw him since. They say that when his
      master jumped overboard, Jack Garrett laid hands on all his property, and
      sailed for America; but I don&rsquo;t believe it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but, Freney, you may believe it, for I was the means of an
      investigation at Liverpool in which the fact transpired, and the name of
      John Garrett was entered in the ship-agent&rsquo;s books; I read it there
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter for that, he dared not venture into the States. I know
      something of Jack&rsquo;s doings among the Yankees, and depend upon it, Mr.
      Daly, he&rsquo;s not gone; it&rsquo;s only a blind to stop pursuit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daly shook his head dubiously, for, having satisfied himself of Garrett&rsquo;s
      escape when at Liverpool, he felt annoyed at any discredit attaching to
      what he deemed his own discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my word for it, Mr. Daly, I &lsquo;m right this time; you cannot think
      what an advantage a man like me possesses in guessing at the way another
      rogue would play his game. Why, sir, I know every turn and double such a
      fellow as Garrett would make. Now, I &lsquo;d wager Matchlock against a
      car-horse that he has not left England, and I &lsquo;d take an even bet he &lsquo;ll
      be at the Spring Meeting at Doncaster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This may be all as you say, Freney,&rdquo; said Daly, after a pause, &ldquo;and yet I
      see no reason to suppose it can interest me, or my friend either. He might
      know something of Gleeson&rsquo;s affairs; he might, perhaps, be able to tell
      something of the payment of that sum at Kildare; if so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If so,&rdquo; interrupted Freney, &ldquo;money would buy the secret; at all events,
      I&rsquo;m determined he shall not escape me so easily. I &lsquo;ll follow the fellow
      to the very threshold of Newgate but I &lsquo;ll have my own,&mdash;it is for
      that purpose I &lsquo;m on my way now. A fishing-boat will sail from Howth by
      to-morrow&rsquo;s tide, and land me somewhere on the Welsh coast, and, if I can
      serve you, why, it&rsquo;s only doing two jobs at the same time. What are the
      points you are anxious to discover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daly reflected for a few moments, and then with distinctness detailed the
      several matters on which he desired information, not only regarding the
      reasons of Gleeson&rsquo;s embarrassments, but the nature of his intimacy with
      old Hickman, of which he entertained deep suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it all,&rdquo; said Freney. &ldquo;You think that Gleeson was in league with
      the doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daly nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was my own notion, too. Ah, sir, if I &lsquo;d only the King&rsquo;s pardon in
      my pocket this night, and the power of an honest man for one month, I &lsquo;d
      stake my head on it, but I would have the whole mystery as clear as
      water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;ll want some money, Freney,&rdquo; said Daly, as he turned to the table,
      and, taking up a key, unlocked the writing-case. &ldquo;I &lsquo;m not as rich just
      now as a Member of Parliament might be after such a Bill as the Union, but
      I hope this may be of some service;&rdquo; and he took a fifty-pound note from
      the desk to hand it to him, but Freney was gone. He had slipped
      noiselessly from the room; the bang of the hall-door was heard at the
      instant, and immediately after the tramp of a horse as he trotted down the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world all over!&rdquo; said Daly to himself. &ldquo;If the man of honor and
      integrity has his flaws and defects, even fellows like that have their
      notions of principle and delicacy too. Confound it! mankind will never let
      me love or hate them.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. &ldquo;A LEAVE-TAKING.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      At Gwynne Abbey, time sped fast and pleasantly; each day brought its own
      enjoyments, and of the Knight&rsquo;s guests there was not one who did not in
      his heart believe that Maurice Darcy was the very happiest man in the
      kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Netherby, the frigid courtier, felt, for the first time, perhaps, in
      his life, how much cordiality can heighten the pleasures of social
      intercourse, and how the courtesy of kind feeling can add to the
      enjoyments of refined and cultivated tastes. Lady Eleanor had lost nothing
      of the powers of fascination for which her youth had been celebrated, and
      there was, in the very seclusion of her life, that which gave the charm of
      novelty to her remarks on people and events. The Knight himself, abounding
      in resources of every kind, was a companion the most fastidious or
      exacting could not weary of; and as for Helen, her captivations were
      acknowledged by those who, but a week before, would not have admitted the
      possibility of any excellence that had not received the stamp of London
      approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crofton could never expatiate sufficiently on the delights of an
      establishment which, with the best cook, the best cellar, and the best
      stable, called not upon him for the exercise of the small talents and
      petty attentions by which his invitations to great houses were usually
      purchased; while the younger men of the party agreed in regarding their
      friend Lionel as the most to be envied of all their acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happiness, perhaps, shines more brightly by reflected light; certainly
      Lionel Darcy never felt more disposed to be content with the world, and,
      although not devoid of a natural pride at exhibiting to his English
      friends the style of his father&rsquo;s house and habits, yet was he far more
      delighted at the praises he heard on every side of the Knight himself.
      Maurice Darcy possessed that rarest of all gifts, the power of being a
      delightful companion to younger men, without ever detracting in the
      slightest degree from the most rigid tone of good taste and good
      principle. The observation may seem an illiberal one, but it is unhappily
      too true, that even among those who from right feeling would be incapable
      of anything mean or sordid, there often prevails a laxity in expression
      and a libertinism of sentiment very far remote from their real opinions,
      and, consequently, such as flatter this tendency are frequently the
      greatest favorites among them. The Knight, not less from high principle
      than pride, rejected every such claim; his manly, joyous temperament
      needed no aids to its powers of interesting and amusing; his sympathies
      went with young men in all their enthusiasm for sport; he gloried in the
      exuberance of their high spirits, and felt his own youth come back in the
      eager pleasure with which he listened to their plans of amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may well be believed with what sorrow to each the morning dawned that
      was to be the last of their visit. These last times are sad things! They
      are the deaths of our affections and attachments; for assuredly the memory
      we retain of past pleasures is only the unreal spirit of a world we are to
      know of no more,&mdash;not alone the records of friends lost or dead, but
      of ourselves, such as we once were, and can never again be; of a time when
      hope was fed by credulity, and could not be exhausted by disappointment.
      They must have had but a brief experience of life who do not see in every
      separation from friends the many chances against their meeting again,
      least of all, of meeting unchanged, with all around them as they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      These thoughts, and others like them, weighed heavily on the hearts of
      those who now assembled for the last time beneath the roof of Gwynne
      Abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain that Lionel suggested various schemes of pleasure for the
      day; the remembrance that it was the last was ever present, and while
      every moment seemed precious, there was a fidgety impatience to be about
      and stirring, mingled with a desire to loiter and linger over the spot so
      associated with pleasant memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      A boating party to Clare Island, long planned and talked over, could find
      now no advocates. All Lionel&rsquo;s descriptions of the shooting along the
      rocky shores of the bay were heard unheeded; every one clung to the abbey,
      as if to enjoy to the very last the sense of home happiness they had known
      there. Even those less likely to indulge feelings of attachment were not
      free from the depressing influence of a last day. Nor were these
      sentiments confined to the visitors only. Lady Eleanor experienced a
      return of her former spirits in her intercourse with those whose habits
      and opinions all reminded her of the past, and would gladly have prolonged
      a visit so full of pleasant recollections. The request was, however, in
      vain; the Earl was to be in waiting early in the following week, Lionel&rsquo;s
      leave was only regimental, and equally limited, and each of the others had
      engagements and projects no less fixed and immutable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In little knots of two and three they spent the day wandering about from
      place to place, to take a last look of the great cliff, to visit for the
      last time the little wood path, whose every turning presented some new
      aspect of the bay and the shore. Lord Netherby attached himself to the
      Knight, devoting himself with a most laudable martyrdom to a morning in
      the farm-yard and the stable, where, notwithstanding all his efforts, his
      blunders betrayed how ill-suited were his habits to country life and its
      interests. He bore all, however, well and heroically, for he had an object
      in view, and that, with him, was always sufficient to induce any degree of
      endurance. Up to this moment he had scarcely enjoyed an opportunity of
      conversing with the Knight on the subject of politics. The few words they
      had exchanged at the cover side were all that passed between them, and
      although they conveyed sentiments very remote from his own, he did not
      entirely despair of gaining over one who evidently was less actuated by
      party motives than impressed by the force of strong personal convictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a man will, of course,&rdquo; thought the Earl, &ldquo;be in the Imperial
      Parliament, and carry with him great influence on every question connected
      with Ireland; his support of the Ministry will be all the more valuable
      that his reputation is intact from every stain of corruption. To withdraw
      him from his own country by the seductions of London life would not be
      easy, but he may be attached to England by ties still more binding.&rdquo; Such
      were some of the reasonings which the wily peer revolved in his mind, and
      to whose aid a fortunate accident had in some measure contributed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I have never shown you our garden, my Lord,&rdquo; said the Knight,
      who, at last taking compassion on the suffering complaisance of the Earl,
      proposed this change. &ldquo;The season is scarcely the most flattering, but we
      are early in this part of Ireland. What say you if we walk thither?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The plan was at once approved of, and after a short circuit through a
      shrubbery, they crossed a large orchard, and, ascending a gentle slope,
      they entered the garden, which rose in successive terraces behind the
      abbey, and commanded a wide prospect over the bay and the sea beyond it.
      Lord Netherby&rsquo;s admiration was not feigned, as he turned his eyes around
      and beheld the extent and beauty of that cultivated scene, which, in the
      brightness of a spring morning, glittered like a gem on the mountain&rsquo;s
      side. The taste alone was not the engrossing thought of his mind, but he
      reflected on the immense expenditure such a caprice must have cost,
      terraced as the ground was into the very granite rock, and the earth all
      supplied artificially. The very keeping these parterres in order was a
      thing of no mean cost. Not all the terrors of his own approaching fate
      could deprive Darcy of a sense of pride as he watched the expression of
      the Earl&rsquo;s features, surprise and wonder depicted in every lineament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How extensive the park is,&rdquo; said the courtier, at length, half ashamed,
      as it seemed, of giving way to his amazement; &ldquo;are those trees yonder
      within your grounds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my Lord: the wood at that point where you see the foam splashing up
      is our limit in that direction; on this side we stretch away somewhat
      further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose property, then, have we yonder, where I see the village?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all the Gwynne estate,&rdquo; said the Knight, with difficulty repressing
      the sigh that rose as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The town also. The worthy monks took a wide circuit, and, by all
      accounts, did not misuse their wealth. I sadly fear, my Lord, their
      successors were not as blameless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A noble possession, indeed!&rdquo; said the Earl, half aloud, and not attending
      to Darcy&rsquo;s remark. &ldquo;Are you certain, my dear Knight, that you have made
      your political influence at all commensurate with the amount of either
      your property or your talents? An English gentleman with an estate like
      this, and ability such as yours, might command any position he pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words, my Lord, he might barter his independence for the
      exercise of a precarious power, and, in ceasing to dispense the duties of
      a landed proprietor, he might become a very considerable ingredient in a
      party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you do not deem the devoir of a country gentleman incompatible
      with the duties of a statesman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means; but I greatly regret the gradual desertion of social
      influence in the search after political ascendency. I am not for the
      working of a system that spoils the gentry, and yet does not make them
      statesmen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet the very essence of our Constitution is to connect the power of
      Government with the possession of landed property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And justly so, too; none other offers so little in return as a mere
      speculation. None is so little exposed to the casualties which affect
      every other kind of wealth. The legitimate influence of the landed gentry
      is the safeguard of the State; but if, by the attractions of power, the
      flatteries of a Court, or the seductions of Party, you withdraw them from
      the rightful sphere of its exercise, you reduce them to the level of the
      Borough members, without, perhaps, their technical knowledge or
      professional acquirements. I am for giving them a higher position,&mdash;the
      heritage of the bold barons, from whom they are descended: but to maintain
      this, they must live on their own estates, dispense the influences of
      their wealth and their morals in their own native districts, be the friend
      of the poor man, the counsellor of the misguided, the encourager of the
      weak; know and be known to all around, not as the corrupt dispensers of
      Government patronage, but the guardians of those whose rights are in their
      keeping for defence and protection. I would have them with their rightful
      influence in the Senate; an influence which should preponderate in both
      Houses. Their rank and education would be the best guarantee for the
      safety and wisdom of their counsels, their property the best surety for
      the permanence of the institutions of the State. Suddenly acquired wealth
      can scarcely be intrusted with political power; it lacks the element of
      prudent caution, by which property is maintained as well as accumulated;
      it wants also the prestige of antiquity as a claim to respect; and,
      legislate as you will, men will look back as well as forward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Netherby made no reply; he thought the Knight, perhaps, was venting
      his own regrets at the downfall of a political ascendency he wished to see
      vested in men of his own station,&mdash;a position they had long enjoyed,
      and which, in some respects, had placed them above the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lay more store by such ties, Knight,&rdquo; said the Earl, in a low,
      insinuating voice, &ldquo;than we are accustomed to do. Blood and birth have
      suffered less admixture with mere wealth here than with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we do, my Lord,&rdquo; said Darcy, smiling; &ldquo;it is the compensation for
      our poverty. Unmixed descent is the boast of many who have retained
      nothing of their ancestors save the name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you yourself can scarcely be an advocate for the maintenance of these
      opinions: this spirit of clan and chieftainship is opposed, not only to
      progress, but to liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have given the best proof of the contrary,&rdquo; said Darcy, laughing, &ldquo;by
      marrying an Englishwoman,&mdash;a dereliction, I assure you, that cost me
      many a warm supporter in this very country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! By the way, I am reminded of a subject I wished to speak of to
      you, and which I have been hesitating whether I should open with my cousin
      Eleanor or yourself; the moment seems, however, propitious,&mdash;may I
      broach it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darcy bowed courteously, and the other resumed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be brief, then. Young Beauclerk, a friend of your son Lionel, has
      been, as every one younger and older than himself must be, greatly taken
      by the charms of Miss Darcy. Brief as the acquaintance here has been, the
      poor fellow is desperately in love, and, while feeling how such an
      acknowledgment might prejudice his chance of success on so short an
      intimacy, he cannot leave this without the effort to secure for his
      pretensions a favorable hearing hereafter. In fact, my dear Knight, he has
      asked of me to be his intercessor with you,&mdash;not to receive him as a
      son-in-law, but to permit him to pay such attentions as, in the event of
      your daughter&rsquo;s acceptance, may enable him to make the offer of his hand
      and fortune. I need not tell you that in point of position and means he is
      unexceptionable; a very old Baronetcy,&mdash;not one of these yesterday
      creations made up of State Physicians and Surgeons in Ordinary,&mdash;an
      estate of above twelve thousand a year. Such are claims to look high with;
      but I confess I think he could not lay them at the feet of one more
      captivating than my fair Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darcy made no reply for several minutes; he pressed his hand across his
      eyes, and turned his head away, as if to escape observation; then, with an
      effort that seemed to demand all his strength, he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is impossible, my Lord. There are reasons&mdash;there are
      circumstances why I cannot entertain this proposition. I am not able to
      explain them; a few days more, and I need not trouble myself on that
      subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The evident agitation of manner the Knight displayed astonished his
      companion, who, while he forebore to ask more directly for its reason, yet
      gently hinted that the obstacles alluded to might be less stringent than
      Darcy deemed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darcy shook his head mournfully, and Lord Netherby, though most anxious to
      divine the secret of his thoughts, had too much breeding to continue the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without any abruptness, which might have left an unpleasant impression
      after it, the polished courtier once more adverted to Beauclerk, but
      rather in a tone of regret for the youth&rsquo;s own sake than with any
      reference to the Knight&rsquo;s refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a kind of selfishness in my advocacy, Knight,&rdquo; said he,
      smiling. &ldquo;I was&mdash;I am&mdash;very much depressed at quitting a spot
      where I have tasted more true happiness than it has been my fortune for
      many years to know, and I wish to carry away with me the reflection that I
      had left the germ of even greater happiness behind me; if Helen, however&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Darcy; &ldquo;here she comes, with her mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lady Eleanor,&rdquo; said Lord Netherby, &ldquo;you have come to see me
      forget all the worldliness it has cost me a life to learn, and actually
      confess that I cannot tear myself away from the abbey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my Lord,&rdquo; interposed Tom Nolan, who had just come up with a large
      walking party, &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s only ordering away the posters, and staying
      another day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, by Jove!&rdquo; cried Crofton; &ldquo;my Lord is in waiting, and I&rsquo;m on
      duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the groups now gathered together from the different parts of the
      garden, Lord Netherby joined Beauclerk, who awaited him in a distant
      alley, and soon after the youth was seen returning alone to the abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time of bustle and leave-taking&mdash;that moment when many a false
      smile and merry speech ill conceals the secret sorrow&mdash;was come, and
      each after each spoke his farewell; and Lord Netherby, kindly pledging
      himself to make Lionel&rsquo;s peace at the Horse Guards for an extended absence
      of some days, thus conferred upon Lady Eleanor the very greatest of
      favors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our next meeting is to be in London, remember,&rdquo; said the peer, in his
      blandest accents. &ldquo;I stand pledged to show my countrymen that I have
      nothing extenuated in speaking of Irish beauty;&mdash;nay, Helen, it is my
      last time, forgive it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There they go,&rdquo; said Darcy, as he looked after the retiring equipages.
      &ldquo;Now, Eleanor, and my dear children, come along with me into the library.
      I have long been struggling against a secret sorrow; another moment would
      be more than I could bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They turned silently towards the abbey, none daring, even by a look, to
      interrogate him whose sad accents foreboded so much evil; yet as they
      walked they drew closer around him, and seemed even by that gesture to
      show that, come what might, they would meet their fortune boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darcy moved on for some minutes sunk in thought; but as he ascended the
      wide steps of the terrace, appearing to read the motives of those who
      clung so closely to his side, he smiled sadly, and said, &ldquo;Ay! I knew it
      well,&mdash;in weal or woe&mdash;together!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. &ldquo;SAD DISCLOSURES.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      The vicissitudes of life are never more palpably displayed before us than
      when the space of a few brief hours has converted the scene of festivity
      and pleasure into one of gloom and sorrow, when the same silent witnesses
      of our joy should be present at our affliction. Thus was it now in the
      richly adorned chambers of Gwynne Abbey, so lately filled with happy faces
      and resounding with pleasant voices,&mdash;all was silent. Iu the
      courtyard, but a day before crowded with brilliant equipages and gay
      horsemen, the long shadows lay dark and unbroken, and the plash of the
      fountain was the only sound in the stillness. Over that wide lawn no
      groups on foot or horseback were to be seen; the landscape was fair and
      soft to look upon; the mild radiance of a spring morning beamed on the
      water and the shore, the fresh budding trees, and the tall towers; and the
      passing traveller who might have stopped to gaze upon that princely
      dwelling and its swelling woods, might have thought it an earthly
      paradise, and that they who owned it must needs be above worldly cares and
      afflictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene within the walls was very unlike this impression. In a darkened
      room, where the close-drawn curtains excluded every ray of sunshine, sat
      Helen Darcy by the bedside of her mother. Lady Eleanor had fallen asleep
      after a night of intense suffering, both of mind and body, and her repose
      even yet exhibited, in short and fitful starts, the terrible traces of an
      agony not yet subdued. Helen was pale as death; two dark circles of almost
      purple hue surrounded her eyes, and her cheeks seemed wasted: yet she had
      not wept. The overwhelming amount of misfortune had stunned her for a
      moment or two, but, recalled to active exertion by her mother&rsquo;s illness,
      she addressed herself to her task, and seemed to have no thought or care
      save to watch and tend her. It was only at last when, wearied out by
      suffering, Lady Eleanor fell into a slumber that Helen&rsquo;s feelings found
      their vent, and the tears rolled heavily along her cheek, and dropped one
      by one upon her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sorrow was indeed great, for it was unalloyed by one selfish feeling;
      her grief was for those a thousand times more dear to her than herself,
      nor through all her affliction did a single thought intrude of how this
      ruin was also her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knight was in the library, where he had passed the night, lying down
      at short intervals to catch some moments&rsquo; rest, and again rising to walk
      the room and reflect upon the coming stroke of fortune. Lionel had parted
      from him at a late hour, promising to go to bed; but, unable to endure the
      gloom of his own thoughts in his chamber, he wandered out into the woods,
      and strolled on without knowing or caring whither, till day broke. The
      bodily exertion at length induced sleep, and after a few hours&rsquo; deep
      repose he joined his father, with few traces of weariness or even sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not without a struggle on either side that they met on that
      morning, and as Darcy grasped his son&rsquo;s hand in both his own, his lip
      trembled, and his strong frame shook with agitation. Lionel&rsquo;s ruddy cheek
      and clear blue eye seemed to reassure the old man&rsquo;s courage; and after
      gazing on him steadfastly with a look where fatherly love and pride were
      blended, he said, &ldquo;I see, my boy, the old blood of a Darcy has not
      degenerated&mdash;you are well to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never was better in my life,&rdquo; said Lionel, boldly; &ldquo;and if I could only
      think that you, my mother, and Helen had no cause for sorrow, I &lsquo;d almost
      say I never felt my spirits higher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own brave-hearted boy,&rdquo; said Darcy, throwing his arms around the
      youth&rsquo;s neck, while the tears gushed from his eyes and a choking stopped
      his utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see your letters have come,&rdquo; said Lionel, gently disengaging himself,
      and affecting a degree of calmness his heart was very far from feeling.
      &ldquo;Do they bring us any news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to hope from,&rdquo; said Darcy, sorrowfully. &ldquo;Daly has seen Hickman&rsquo;s
      solicitors, and the matter is as I expected: Gleeson did not pay the bond
      debt; his journey to Kildare was, probably, undertaken to gain time until
      the moment of the American ship&rsquo;s sailing. He must have meditated this
      step for a considerable time, for it now appears that his losses in South
      America occurred several years back, though carefully screened from public
      knowledge. The man was a cold, calculating scoundrel, who practised
      peculation systematically and slowly; his resolve to escape was not a
      sudden notion,&mdash;these are Bagenal Daly&rsquo;s impressions at least, and I
      begin to feel their force myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Daly offer any suggestion for our guidance, or say how we should
      act?&rdquo; said Lionel, far more eager to meet the present than speculate on
      either the past or the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he gives us a choice of counsels, honestly confessing that his own
      advice meets little support or sympathy with the lawyers. It is to hold
      forcible possession of the abbey, to leave Hickman to his remedy by law,
      and to defy him when he has even got a verdict; he enumerates very
      circumstantially all our means of defence, and exhibits a very hopeful
      array of lawless probabilities in our favor. But this is a counsel I would
      never follow; it would not become one who has in a long life endeavored to
      set the example among the people of obedience and observance to law, to
      obliterate by one act of rashness and folly the whole force of his
      teaching. No, Lionel, we are cleanhanded on this score, and if the lesson,
      be a heavy one for ourselves, let it not be profitless for our poor
      neighbors. This is your own feeling too, my boy, I&rsquo;m certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lionel bit his lip, and his cheek grew scarlet; when, after a pause, he
      said, &ldquo;And the other plan, what is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The renewed offer of his cottage on the northern coast, a lonely and
      secluded spot, where we can remain at least until we determine on
      something better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that may be a wiser course,&rdquo; muttered the youth, half aloud; &ldquo;my
      mother and Helen are to be thought of first. And yet, father, I. cannot
      help thinking Daly&rsquo;s first counsel has something in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something in it! ay, Lionel, that it has,&mdash;the whole story of our
      country&rsquo;s misery and degradation. The owner of the soil has diffused
      little else among the people than the licentious terror of his own
      unbridled passion; he has taught lawless outrage, when he should have
      inculcated obedience and submission. The corruption of our people has come
      from above downwards; the heavy retribution will come one day; and when
      the vices of the peasant shall ascend to the master, the social ruin will
      be complete. To this dreadful consummation let us lend no aid. No, no,
      Lionel, sorrow may be lessened by time; but remorse is undying and
      eternal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must leave the Guards at once,&rdquo; said the young man, pacing the room
      slowly, and endeavoring to speak with an air of calm composure, while
      every feature of his face betrayed the agitation he suffered; &ldquo;an exchange
      will not be difficult to manage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have some debts, too, in London: they must be cared for immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of any large amount; my horses and carriages when sold will more
      than meet all I owe. Have you formed any guess as to what income will be
      left you to live on?&rdquo; said he, in a voice which anxiety made weak and
      tremulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without Daly&rsquo;s assistance, I cannot answer that point; the extent of this
      fellow Gleeson&rsquo;s iniquity seems but half explored. The likelihood is, that
      your mother&rsquo;s jointure will be the utmost we can save from the wreck. Even
      that, however, will be enough for all we need, although, from motives of
      delicacy on her part, it was originally set down at a very small sum,&mdash;not
      more than a thousand per annum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long silence now ensued. The Knight, buried in thought, sat with his
      arms crossed, and his eyes bent upon the ground. Lionel leaned on the
      window-frame and looked out upon the lawn; nothing stirred, no sound was
      heard save the sharp ticking of the clock upon the mantelpiece, which
      marked with distinctness every second, as if reminding them of the
      fleeting moments that were to be their last beneath that roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the 24th, if I remember aright,&rdquo; said Darcy, looking up at the
      dial; &ldquo;at noon, to-day, we are no longer masters here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Hickmans will scarcely venture to push matters to such extremities;
      an assurance that we are willing to surrender peaceable possession will, I
      trust, be sufficient to prevent the indecency of a rapid flight from our
      own house and home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are legal forms of possession to be gone through, I believe,&rdquo; said
      the Knight, sorrowfully; &ldquo;certain observances the law exacts, which would
      be no less painful for us to witness than the actual presence of our
      successors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can this be? I saw a carriage disappear behind the copse yonder.
      There it is again, coming along by the lake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daly&mdash;Bagenal Daly, I hope and trust!&rdquo; exclaimed Darcy, as he stood
      straining his eyes to catch the moving object.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not; the horses do not look like posters. Heaven grant we have no
      visitors at such a time as this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carriage, although clearly visible the moment before, was now
      concealed from view by an angle of the wood, nor would it again be in
      sight before reaching the abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s indisposition is reason sufficient not to receive them,&rdquo;
       said Darcy, almost sternly. &ldquo;I would not continue the part I have played
      during the last week, no, not for an hour longer, to be assured of rescue
      from every difficulty. The duplicity went nigh to break my heart; ay, and
      it would have done so, or driven me mad, had the effort been sustained any
      further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not expect any one, did you?&rdquo; asked Lionel, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one; there&rsquo;s a mass of letters, with invitations and civil messages,
      there on the table, but no proffered visits among them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lionel walked to the table and turned over the various notes which lay
      along with newspapers and pamphlets scattered about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; muttered the Knight, in a low tone, &ldquo;they read strangely now, these
      plans of pleasure and festivity, when ruin is so near us; the kind
      pressings to spend a week here, and a fortnight there. It reminds me,
      Lionel,&rdquo;&mdash;and here a smile of sad but sweet melancholy passed across
      his features,&mdash;&ldquo;it reminds me of the old story they tell of my
      grand-uncle Robert. He commanded the &lsquo;Dreadnought,&rsquo; under Drake, at Cape
      St. Vincent, and at the close of a very sharp action was signalled to come
      on board the admiral&rsquo;s vessel to dinner. The poor &lsquo;Dreadnought&rsquo; was like a
      sieve, the sea running in and out through her shot-holes, and her sails
      hanging like rags around her, her deck covered with wounded, and slippery
      with gore. Captain Darcy, however, hastened to obey the command of his
      superior, changed his dress and ordered his boat to be manned; but this
      was no easy matter, there was scarcely a boat&rsquo;s crew to be had without
      taking away the men necessary to work the ship. The difficulty soon became
      more pressing, for a plank had suddenly sprung from a double-headed shot,
      and all the efforts of the pumps could not keep the vessel afloat, with a
      heavy sea rolling at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The admiral&rsquo;s signal is repeated, sir,&rsquo; said the lieutenant on duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Very well, Mr. Hay; keep her before the wind,&rsquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The ship is settling fast, sir,&rsquo; said the master; &lsquo;no boat could live in
      that sea; they &lsquo;re all damaged by shot.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Signal the flag-ship,&rsquo; cried out Darcy; &lsquo;signal the admiral that I am
      ready to obey him, but we &lsquo;re sinking.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bunting floated at the mast-head for a moment or two, but the waves
      were soon many fathoms over it, and the &lsquo;Dreadnought&rsquo; was never seen
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it would seem,&rdquo; said Lionel, with a half-bitter laugh, &ldquo;we are not the
      first of the family who went down head foremost. But I hear a voice
      without. Surely old Tate is not fool enough to admit any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible&mdash;&rdquo; But before the Knight could finish, the old butler
      entered to announce Mr. Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly. Advancing towards the Knight
      with a most cordial air, he seemed bent on anticipating any possible
      expression of displeasure at his unexpected appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am aware, Knight,&rdquo; said he, in an accent the most soft and
      conciliating, &ldquo;how indelicate a visit from me at such a moment may seem;
      but if you accord me a few moments of private interview, I hope to dispel
      the unpleasant impression.&rdquo; He looked towards Lionel as he spoke, and
      though he smiled his blandest of all smiles, evidently hinted at the
      possibility of his leaving them alone together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no confidences apart from my son, sir,&rdquo; said Darcy, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course not&mdash;perfectly natural at Captain Darcy&rsquo;s age&mdash;such
      a thought would be absurd; still, there are circumstances which might
      possibly excuse my request&mdash;I mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lionel did not suffer him to finish the sentence, but, turning abruptly
      round, left the room, saying as he went, &ldquo;I have some orders to give in
      the stable, but I&rsquo;ll not go further away if you want me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; said the Knight, haughtily, &ldquo;we are alone, and not likely to
      be interrupted; may I ask, as a great favor, that in any communication you
      may have to make, you will be as brief as consists with your object; for,
      to say truth, I have many things on my mind, and many important calls to
      attend to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, then,&rdquo; said Hickman, assuming a manner intended to
      convey the impression of perfect frankness and candor, &ldquo;let me make a
      confession, which, however humiliating to avow, would be still more
      injurious to hold in reserve. I have neither act nor part in the
      proceedings my father has lately taken respecting your mutual dealings.
      Not only that he has not consulted me, but every attempt on my part to
      ascertain the course of events, or mitigate their rigor, has been met by a
      direct, not unfrequently a rude, repulse.&rdquo; He waited at this pause for the
      Knight to speak, but a cold and dignified bow was all the acknowledgment
      returned. &ldquo;This may appear strange and inexplicable in your eyes,&rdquo; said
      O&rsquo;Reilly, who mistook the Knight&rsquo;s indifference for incredulity, &ldquo;but
      perhaps I can explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not the slightest necessity to do so, Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly; I have no
      reason to doubt one word you have stated; for not only am I ignorant of
      what the nature and extent of the proceedings you allude to may be, but I
      am equally indifferent as to the spirit that dictates or the number of
      advisers that suggest them; pardon me if I seem rude or uncourteous, but
      there are circumstances in life in which not to be selfish would be to
      become insensible; my present condition is, perhaps, one of them. A breach
      of trust on the part of one who possessed my fullest confidence has
      involved all, or nearly all, I had in the world. The steps by which I am
      to be deprived of what was once my own are, as regards myself, matters of
      comparative indifference; with respect to others&rdquo;&mdash;here he almost
      faltered&mdash;&ldquo;I hope they may be dictated by proper feeling and
      consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be assured they shall, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly; and then, as if
      correcting a too hasty avowal, added, &ldquo;but I have the strongest hopes that
      the matters are not yet in such an extremity as you speak of. It is true,
      sir, I will not conceal from you, my father is not free from the faults of
      age; his passion for money-getting has absorbed his whole heart, to the
      exclusion of many amiable and estimable traits; to enforce a legal right
      with him seems a duty, and not an option; and I may mention here that your
      friend, Mr. Daly, has not taken any particular pains towards conciliating
      him; indeed, he has scarcely acted a prudent part as regards you, by the
      unceasing rancor he has exhibited towards our family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must interrupt you, sir,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;and assure you that, while
      there are unfortunately but too many topics which could pain me at this
      moment, there is not one more certain to offend me than any reflection,
      even the slightest, on the oldest friend I have in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly denied the most remote intention of giving pain, and
      proceeded. &ldquo;I was speaking of my father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and however unpleasant
      the confession from a son&rsquo;s lips, I must say that the legality of his acts
      is the extent to which they claim his observance. When his solicitors
      informed him that the interest was unpaid on your bond, he directed the
      steps to enforce the payment, and subsequently to foreclose the deed.
      These are, after all, mere preliminary proceedings, and in no way preclude
      an arrangement for a renewal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a proposition&mdash;let me interrupt you&mdash;such a proposition is
      wholly out of the question; the ruin that has cost us our house and home
      has spared nothing. I have no means by which I could anticipate the
      payment of so large a sum, nor is it either my intention or my wish to
      reside longer beneath this roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, sir, your determination is not unalterable; it would be the
      greatest affliction of my life to think that the loss to this county of
      its oldest family was even in the remotest degree ascribed to us. The
      Darcys have been the boast and pride of western Ireland for centuries; our
      county would be robbed of its fairest ornament by the departure of those
      who hold a princely state and derive a more than princely devotion among
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If our claims had no other foundation, Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly, our altered
      circumstances would now obliterate them. To live here with diminished
      fortune&mdash;But I ask pardon for being led away in this manner; may I
      beg that you will now inform me to what peculiar circumstances I owe the
      honor of your visit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Reilly, insinuatingly, &ldquo;that I had mentioned the
      difference of feeling entertained by my father and myself respecting
      certain proceedings at law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite correct, you did so; but I may observe, without incivility,
      that however complimentary to your own sense of delicacy such a difference
      is, for me the matter has no immediate interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, with your kind permission, I can give it some,&rdquo; replied
      O&rsquo;Reilly, drawing his chair close, and speaking in a low and confidential
      voice; &ldquo;but in order to let my communication have the value I would wish
      it, may I bespeak for myself a favorable hearing and a kind construction
      on what I shall say? If by an error of judgment&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Darcy, sighing, while a sad smile dimpled his mouth&mdash;&ldquo;ah!
      no man should be more lenient to such than myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if reassured by the kindly tone of these few words, O&rsquo;Reilly resumed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some weeks ago my father waited upon Lady Eleanor Darcy with a
      proposition which, whether on its own merits, or from want of proper tact
      in his advocacy of it, met with a most unfavorable reception. It is not
      because circumstances have greatly altered in that brief interval&mdash;which
      I deeply regret to say is the case&mdash;that I dare to augur a more
      propitious hearing, but simply because I hope to show that in making it we
      were actuated by a spirit of honorable, if not of laudable, ambition. The
      rank and position my son will enjoy in this county, his fortune and
      estate, are such as to make any alliance, save with your family, a
      question of no possible pretension. I am well aware, sir, of the great
      disparity between a new house and one ennobled by centuries of descent. I
      have thought long and deeply on the interval that separates the rank of
      the mere country gentleman from the position of him who claims even higher
      station than nobility itself; but we live in changeful times: the Peerage
      has its daily accessions of rank as humble as my own; its new creations
      are the conscripts drawn from wealth as well as distinction in arms or
      learning, and in every case the new generation obliterates the memory of
      its immediate origin. I see you agree with me; I rejoice to find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your observations are quite just,&rdquo; said Darcy, calmly, and O&rsquo;Reilly went
      on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir, I would not only reiterate my father&rsquo;s proposal, but I would
      add to it what I hope and trust will be deemed no ungenerous offer, which
      is, that the young lady&rsquo;s fortune should be this estate of Gwynne Abbey,
      not to be endowed by her future husband, but settled on her by her father
      as her marriage portion. I see your meaning,&mdash;it is no longer his to
      give: but we are ready to make it so; the bond we hold shall be thrown
      into the fire the moment your consent is uttered. We prefer a thousand
      times it should be thus, than that the ancient acres of this noble
      heritage should even for a moment cease to be the property of your house.
      Let me recapitulate a little&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that is unnecessary,&rdquo; said Darcy, calmly; &ldquo;I have bestowed the
      most patient attention to your remarks, and have no difficulty in
      comprehending them. Have you anything to add?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of much consequence,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Reilly, not a little pleased by the
      favorable tone of the Knight&rsquo;s manner; &ldquo;what I should suggest in addition
      is that my son should assume the name and arms of Darcy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The noise of footsteps and voices without at this moment interrupted the
      speaker, the door suddenly opened, and Bagenal Daly entered. He was
      splashed from head to foot, his high riding-boots stained with the saddle
      and the road, and his appearance vouching for a long and wearisome
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morrow, Darcy,&rdquo; said he, grasping the Knight&rsquo;s hand with the grip of
      his iron fingers.&mdash;&ldquo;Your servant, sir; I scarcely expected to see you
      here <i>so soon</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The emphasis with which he spoke the last words brought the color to
      O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s cheek, who seemed very miserable at the interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came to take possession,&rdquo; continued Daly, fixing his eyes on him with
      a steadfast stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mistake, Bagenal,&rdquo; said the Knight, gently; &ldquo;Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly is come
      with a very different object,&mdash;one which I trust he will deem it no
      breach of confidence or propriety in me if I mention it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret to say, sir,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Reilly, hastily, &ldquo;that I cannot give my
      permission in this instance. Whatever the fate of the proposal I have made
      to you, I beg it to be understood as made under the seal of honorable
      secrecy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darcy bowed deeply, but made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound me,&rdquo; cried Daly, &ldquo;if I understand any compact between two such
      men as you to require all this privacy, unless you were hardy enough to
      renew your old father&rsquo;s proposal for my friend&rsquo;s daughter, and now had
      modesty enough to feel ashamed of your own impudence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no stranger, sir, to the indecent liberties you permit your tongue
      to take,&rdquo; said Hickman, moving towards the door; &ldquo;but this is neither the
      time nor place to notice them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So then I was right,&rdquo; cried Daly; &ldquo;I guessed well the game you would play&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bagenal,&rdquo; interposed the Knight, &ldquo;I must atop this. Mr. Hickman is now
      beneath my roof&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he, faith?&mdash;not in his own estimation then. Why, his fellows are
      taking an inventory of the furniture at this very moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this true, sir?&rdquo; said Darcy, turning a fierce look towards O&rsquo;Reilly,
      whose face became suddenly of an ashy paleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If so,&rdquo; muttered he, &ldquo;I can only assure you that it is without any orders
      of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good!&rdquo; said Daly, bursting into an insolent laugh; &ldquo;why, Darcy, when
      you meet with a fellow in your plantations with a gun in his hand and a
      lurcher at his heels, are you disposed to regard him as one in search of
      the picturesque, or a poacher? So, when a gentleman travels about the
      country with a sub-sheriff in his carriage and two bailiffs in the rumble,
      does it seem exactly the guise of one paying morning calls to his
      neighbors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly, I ask you to explain this proceeding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess, sir,&rdquo; stammered out the other, &ldquo;I came accompanied by certain
      persons in authority, but who have acted in this matter entirely without
      my permission. The proposal I have made this day was the cause of my
      visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a subject on which I can no longer hold any secrecy,&rdquo; said the
      Knight, haughtily. &ldquo;Bagenal, you were quite correct in your surmise. Mr.
      O&rsquo;Reilly not only intended us the honor of an alliance, but offered to
      merge the ancient glories of his house by assuming the more humble name
      and shield of Darcy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! eh! did I hear aright?&rdquo; said Daly, with a broken voice; while,
      walking to the window, he looked down into the lawn beneath, as if
      calculating the height from the ground. &ldquo;By Heaven, Darcy, you &lsquo;re the
      best-tempered fellow in Europe&mdash;that &lsquo;s all,&rdquo; he muttered, as he
      walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened at this moment, and the shock bullet head of a bailiff
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Mr. Daly! there he is!&rdquo; cried out O&rsquo;Reilly, who, pale with passion
      and trembling all over, supported himself against the back of a chair with
      one hand, while with the other he pointed to where Daly stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said the fellow, entering, while he drew a slip of paper
      from his breast, &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll take the opportunity of sarvin&rsquo; him where he
      stands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One step nearer! one step!&rdquo; said Daly, as he took a pistol from the
      pocket of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man hesitated and looked at O&rsquo;Reilly, as if for advice or
      encouragement; but terror and rage had now deprived him of all
      self-possession, and he neither spoke nor signed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the room, sir,&rdquo; said the Knight, with a motion of his hand to the
      bailiff; and the ruffian, whose office had familiarized him long with
      scenes of outrage and violence, shrank back ashamed and abashed, and
      slipped from the room without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly,&rdquo; continued Darcy, with an accent calm and
      unmoved,&mdash;&ldquo;I believe our conference is now concluded. I will not
      insult your own acuteness by saying how unnecessary I feel any reply to
      your demand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Reilly, &ldquo;may I presume that there is no objection
      to proceed with those legal formalities which, although begun without my
      knowledge, may be effected now as well as at any other period?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darcy, there is but one way of dealing with that gentleman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bagenal, I must insist upon your leaving this matter solely with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depend upon it, sir, your interests will not gain by your friend&rsquo;s
      counsels,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Reilly, with an insolent sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such another remark from your lips,&rdquo; said Darcy, sternly, &ldquo;would make me
      follow them, if they went so far as&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throwing him neck and heels out of that window,&rdquo; broke in Daly; &ldquo;for I
      own to you it&rsquo;s the course I &lsquo;d have taken half an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you good morning, Mr. Darcy,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Reilly, addressing him for
      the first time by the name of his family instead of his usual designation;
      and without vouchsafing a word to Daly, he retired from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s carriage drove past the window that either
      Darcy or his friend uttered a syllable; they stood apparently lost in
      thought up to that moment, when the noise of wheels and the tramp of
      horses aroused them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must lose no time, Bagenal,&rdquo; said the Knight, hastily; &ldquo;I cannot count
      very far on that gentleman&rsquo;s delicacy or forbearance. Lady Eleanor must
      not be exposed to the indignities the law will permit him to practise
      towards us; we must, if possible, leave this to-night;&rdquo; and so saying, he
      left the room to make arrangements in accordance with his resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bagenal Daly looked after him for a moment. &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; muttered he,
      &ldquo;how manfully he bears it!&rdquo; When a sudden flush that covered his cheek
      bespoke a rapid change of sentiment, and at the same instant he left the
      room, and, crossing the hall and the courtyard, walked hastily towards the
      stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saddle a horse for me, Carney, and as fast as may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a mare ready this minute, sir; she was going out to take her
      gallop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give it, then,&rdquo; said Daly, as he buttoned up his coat; and then,
      breaking off a branch of the old willow that hung over the fountain,
      sprang in the saddle with an alertness that would not have disgraced a
      youth of twenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he goes,&rdquo; muttered the old huntsman, as he looked after him, &ldquo;and
      there is n&rsquo;t the man between this and Killy-begs can take as much out of a
      baste as himself. &lsquo;T is quiet enough the mare will be when he turns her
      head into this yard again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whatever Daly&rsquo;s purpose, it seemed one which brooked little delay, for no
      sooner was he on the sward than he pushed the mare to a fast gallop, and
      was seen sweeping along the lawn at a tremendous pace. In less than ten
      minutes he saw O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s carriage, as, in a rapid trot, the horses
      advanced along the level avenue, and almost the moment after, he had
      stationed himself in the road, so as to prevent their proceeding further.
      The coachman, who knew him well, came to a stop at his signal, and before
      his master could ask the reason, Daly was beside the window of the
      chariot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would wish a word with you, Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly,&rdquo; said he, in a low, subdued
      voice, so as to be inaudible to the sub-sheriff, who was seated beside
      him. &ldquo;You made use of an expression a few moments ago, which, if I
      understood aright, convinces me I have unwittingly done you great
      injustice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O&rsquo;Reilly, whose ashy cheek and affrighted air bespoke a heart but ill at
      ease, made no reply, and Daly went on,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said, sir, that neither the time nor the place suited the notice you
      felt called upon to take of my remarks on your conduct. May I ask, as a
      very great favor, what time and what place will be more convenient to you?
      And I cannot better express my own sense of regret for a hasty expression
      than by assuring you that I shall hold myself bound to be at your service
      in both respects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hostile meeting, sir, is that your proposition?&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Reilly, aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How admirably you read a riddle!&rdquo; said Daly, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Mr. Jones!&rdquo; cried O&rsquo;Reilly, turning to his companion, &ldquo;I call on
      you to witness the words,&mdash;a provocation to a duel offered by this
      gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; rejoined Daly; &ldquo;the provocation came from yourself,&mdash;at
      least, you used a phrase which men with blood in their veins understand
      but one way. My error&mdash;and I &lsquo;ll not forgive myself in haste for it&mdash;was
      the belief that an upstart need not of necessity be a poltroon.&mdash;Drive
      on,&rdquo; cried he to the coachman, with a sneering laugh; &ldquo;your master is
      looking pale.&rdquo; And, with these words, he turned his horse&rsquo;s head, and
      cantered slowly back towards the abbey.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. TATE SULLIVAN&rsquo;S FAREWELL
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sorrows and sufferings of noble minds are melancholy themes to dwell
      upon; they may &ldquo;point a moral,&rdquo; but they scarcely &ldquo;adorn a tale,&rdquo; least of
      all such a tale as ours is intended to be. While, therefore, we would
      spare our readers and ourselves the pain of this narration, we cannot
      leave that old abbey, which we remember so full of happiness, without one
      parting look at it, in company with those about to quit it forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the time of Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s leave-taking, the day, notwithstanding its
      gloomy presage, went over rapidly. The Knight busied himself with internal
      arrangements, while Lionel took into his charge all the preparations for
      their departure on the morrow, Bagenal Daly assisting each in turn, and
      displaying an amount of calm foresight and circumspection in details which
      few would have given him credit for. Meanwhile, Lady Eleanor slept long
      and heavily, and awoke, not only refreshed in body, but with an appearance
      of quiet energy and determination she had not shown for years past. Great
      indeed was the Knight&rsquo;s astonishment on hearing that she intended joining
      them at dinner; in her usual habit she dined early, and with Helen alone
      for her companion, so that her present resolve created the more surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was ordered in the library, and poor old Tate, by some strange
      motive of sympathy, took a more than common pains in all the decorations
      of the table. The flowers which Lady Eleanor was fondest of decked the
      centre&mdash;alas, there was no need to husband them now! on the morrow
      who was to care for them?&mdash;a little bouquet of fresh violets marked
      her place at the table, and more than a dozen times did the old man
      hesitate how the light should fall through the large window, and whether
      it would be more soothing to his mistress to look abroad upon that fair
      and swelling landscape so dear to her, or more painful to gaze upon the
      scenes she should never see more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was myself,&rdquo; muttered old Tate, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be looking at it as
      long as I could, and make it follow me in my dhrames after; but sure there
      &lsquo;s no knowing how great people feels! they say they never has the same
      kind of thought as us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor fellow, he little knew how levelling is misfortune, and that the
      calamities of life evoke the same sufferings in the breast of the king and
      the peasant. With a delicacy one more highly born might have been proud
      of, the old butler alone waited at dinner, well judging that his familiar
      face would be less irksome to them than the prying looks of the other
      servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there are people who can expend much eloquent indignation on those
      social usages which exact a certain amount of decorous observance in all
      the trials and crosses of life, there is a great deal to be said in favor
      of that system of conventional good-breeding whose aim is to repress
      selfish indulgence, and make the individual feel that, whatever his own
      griefs, the claims of the world demand a fortitude and a bearing that
      shall not obtrude his sorrows on his neighbors. That the code may be
      abused, and become occasionally hypocritical in practice, is no argument
      against it; we would merely speak in praise of that well-bred forbearance
      which always merges private afflictions in the desire to make others
      happy. To instance our meaning, we would speak of those who now met at
      dinner in the old library of Gwynne Abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be greatly to mistake us to suppose that we uphold any show or
      counterfeit of kindliness where there is no substance of the feeling
      behind it; we merely maintain that the very highest and most acute
      sympathy is not inconsistent with a bearing of easy, nay, almost cheerful
      character. So truly was it the case here that old Tate Sullivan more than
      once stood still in amazement at the tranquil faces and familiar quietude
      of those who, in his own condition of life, could have found no accents
      loud or piercing enough to bewail their sorrow, and whom, even with his
      long knowledge of them, he could scarcely acquit of insensibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a contagion in an effort of this kind most remarkable. The light
      and gentle attempts made by Lady Eleanor to sustain the spirits of the
      party were met by sallies of manly good-humor by the Knight himself, in
      which Lionel and Helen were not slow to join, while Bagenal Daly could
      scarcely repress his enthusiastic delight at the noble and high-souled
      courage that sustained them one and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      While by a tacit understanding they avoided any allusion to the painful
      circumstances of their late misfortune, the Knight adroitly turned the
      conversation to their approaching journey northwards, and drew from Daly a
      description of &ldquo;the Corvy&rdquo; that actually evoked a burst of downright
      laughter. From this he passed on to speak of the peasantry, so unlike in
      every trait those of the South and West; the calm, reflective character of
      their minds, uninfluenced by passion and unmarked by enthusiasm, were a
      strong contrast to the headlong impulse and ardent temperament of the
      &ldquo;real Irish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;ll scarcely like them at first, my dear Helen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still less on a longer acquaintance,&rdquo; broke in Helen. &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll not quarrel
      with the caution and reserve of the Scotchman,&mdash;the very mists of his
      native mountains may teach him doubt and uncertainty of purpose; but here
      at home, what have such frames of mind and thought in common with our less
      calculating natures?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were far better had they met oftener,&rdquo; said the Knight, thoughtfully;
      &ldquo;impulse is only noble when well directed; the passionate pilots are more
      frequently the cause of shipwreck than of safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing so wearisome as the trade-winds,&rdquo; said Helen, with a saucy toss
      of the head; &ldquo;eh, Lionel, you are of my mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do push one&rsquo;s temper very hard now and then,&rdquo; said Daly, with a
      stern frown; &ldquo;that impassive habit they have of taking everything as in
      the common order of events is, I own, somewhat difficult to bear with. I
      remember being run away with on a blood mare from a little village called
      Ballintray. The beast was in high condition, and I turned her, without
      knowing the country, at the first hill I could see; she breasted it
      boldly, and, though full a quarter of a mile in length, never shortened
      stride to the very summit. What was my surprise, when I gained the top, to
      see that we were exactly over the sea. It was a cliff which, projecting
      for some distance out, was fissured by an immense chasm, through which the
      waves passed; not very wide, but deep enough to make it a very awful leap.
      Over it she went, and then, when I expected her to dash onwards, and was
      already preparing to fling myself from the saddle, she stood stock still,
      trembling all over, and snorting with fear at the danger around her. At
      the same instant, a hard-featured old fellow popped his head up from amid
      the tall fern which he had been cutting for thatch for his cabin, and
      looked at me, not the slightest sign of astonishment in his cold, rigid
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ye &lsquo;ll no get back so easy, my bonnie mon,&rsquo; said he, with the slightest
      possible approach to a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Get back! no, faith, I &lsquo;ll not try it,&rsquo; said I, looking at the yawning
      gulf, through which the wild waves boiled, and the opposite bank several
      feet higher than the ground I stood upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I thought sae,&rsquo; was the rejoinder; when, rising slowly, he leisurely
      walked round the mare, as she stood riveted by fear to the one spot. &lsquo;I
      &lsquo;ll gie ye sax shilling for the hide o&rsquo; her forbye the shoes,&rsquo; added he,
      with a voice as imperturbable as though he were pricing the commonest
      commodity of a market.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess it was fortunate that the ludicrous was stronger in me at the
      moment than indignation, for if I had not laughed at him I might have done
      worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not endure such a peasantry,&rdquo; said Helen, as soon as the mirth
      the anecdote called forth had subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite true,&rdquo; said Daly, &ldquo;they have burlesqued Scotch prudence in the
      same way that the Anglo-Hibernian has travestied the Irish temperament. It
      is the danger of all imitators, they always transgress the limits of their
      model.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is fortunate,&rdquo; broke in the Knight, &ldquo;that traits which conciliate so
      little the stranger should win their way on nearer intimacy; and such I
      believe to be the case with the Ulster peasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Daly; &ldquo;no man can detest more cordially than I do
      the rudeness that is assumed to heighten a contrast with any good quality
      behind it. In most instances the kernel is not worth the trouble of
      breaking off the husk; but with the Northerner this is not the case: in
      his independence he neither apes the equality of the Frenchman nor the
      license of the Yankee. That he suffices for himself, and seeks neither
      patron nor protector, is the source of honest pride, and if this sometimes
      takes the guise of stubbornness, let us remember that the virtue was
      reared in poverty, without encouragement or example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the gentry,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, &ldquo;have they any trace of these
      peculiarities observable among the people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentry!&rdquo; said Daly, impetuously, &ldquo;I know of none. There are some thrifty
      families, who, by some generations of hard saving, have risen to affluence
      and wealth. They are keen fellows, given to money-getting,&mdash;millers
      some of them, bleachers most, with a tenantry of weavers, and estates like
      the grass-plot of a laundry. They are as crafty and as calculating as the
      peasant, shrewd as stockbrokers at a bargain, and as pretentious as a
      Prince Palatine with a territory the size of Merrion Square. Gentry! they
      have neither ancestry nor tradition; they hold their estates from certain
      Guilds, whose very titles are a parody upon gentle breeding,&mdash;fishmongers
      and clothworkers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not be their champion against you, Bagenal, but I cannot help
      feeling how heavily they might retort upon us. These same prudent and
      prosaic landlords have not spent their fortunes in wasteful extravagance
      and absurd display; they have not rackrented their tenantry that they
      might rival a neighbor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sincerely rejoiced,&rdquo; interposed Lady Eleanor, smiling, &ldquo;that my
      English relative, Lord Netherby, was not a witness to this discussion,
      lest he should fancy that, between the wastefulness of the South and the
      thrift of the North, this poor island was but ill provided with a gentry.
      Pray, Mr. Daly, how does your sister like the North? She is our neighbor,
      is she not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&mdash;that is to say, a few miles distant,&rdquo; said Daly, confusedly;
      for he had never acknowledged that &ldquo;the Corvy&rdquo; had been Miss Daly&rsquo;s
      residence. &ldquo;Of the neighborhood she knows nothing; she is not free from my
      own prejudices, and lives a very secluded life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation now became broken and unconnected, and the party soon
      after retired to the drawing-room, where, while Lady Eleanor and Helen sat
      together, the Knight, Daly, and Lionel gathered in a little knot, and
      discussed, in a low tone, the various steps for the coming journey, and
      the probable events of the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was agreed upon that Daly should accompany the Darcys to the North,
      whither Sandy was already despatched, but that Lionel should remain at the
      abbey for some days longer, to complete the arrangements necessary for the
      removal of certain family papers and the due surrender of the property to
      its new owner; after which he should repair to London, and procure his
      exchange into some regiment of the line, and, if possible, one on some
      foreign station,&mdash;the meeting with friends and acquaintances, under
      his now altered fortunes, being judged as a trial too painful and too
      difficult to undergo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again they all met around the tea-table, and once more they talked in the
      same vein of mutual confidence; each conscious of the effort by which he
      sustained his part, and wondering how the others summoned courage to do
      what cost himself so much. They chatted away till near midnight, and when
      they shook hands at separating, it was with feelings of affection to which
      sorrow had only added fresh and stronger ties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daly stood for some time alone in the library, wondering within himself at
      the noble fortitude with which they severally sustained their dreadful
      reverse. It is only the man of stout heart can truly estimate the higher
      attributes of courage; but even to him these efforts seemed surprising.
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; muttered he, &ldquo;each nobly upholds the other; it is opposing a hollow
      square to fortune: so long as they stand firm and together, well! let but
      one quail and falter, let the line be broken, and they would be swept away
      at once and forever.&rdquo; Taking a caudle from the table, he left the room,
      and ascended the wide staircase towards his chamber. All was still and
      noiseless, and to prevent his footsteps being heard, he entered the little
      corridor which opened on the gallery of the refectory, the same from which
      Forester first caught sight of the party at the dinner-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely, with careful hand, closed the door behind him, when,
      looking over the balustrades of the gallery, he beheld a figure moving
      slowly along in the great apartment beneath, guided by a small lamp, which
      threw its uncertain light rather on the wall than on the form of him who
      carried it. Suddenly stopping before one of the large portraits which in a
      long succession graced the chamber, the light was turned fully round, so
      as to display the broad and massive features of old Tate Sullivan. Curious
      to ascertain what the old man might be about in such a place at such an
      hour, Daly extinguished the candle to watch him unobserved. Tate was
      dressed in his most accurate costume: his long cravat, edged with deep
      lace, descended in front of his capacious white waistcoat; silver buckles,
      of a size that showed there was no parsimony of the precious metal, shone
      in his shoes; and his newly powdered wig displayed an almost snowy lustre.
      His gestures were in accordance with the careful observances of his
      toilet; he moved along the floor with a slow, sliding step, bowing deeply
      and reverentially as he went, and with all the courtesy he would have
      displayed if ushering a goodly company into the state drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bagenal Daly was not left long to speculate on honest Tate&rsquo;s intentions;
      and although to a stranger&rsquo;s eyes the motives might have seemed strange
      and dubious, the mystery was easily solved to him, who knew the old man
      well and thoroughly. He was there to take a last look, and bid farewell to
      those venerable portraits, who for more than half a century were enshrined
      in his memory like saints. Around them were associated all the little
      incidents of his peaceful life; they were the chroniclers of his
      impressions in boyhood, in manhood, and in age; he could call to mind the
      first moments he gazed on them in awe-struck veneration; he could remember
      the proud period when the duty first devolved upon him of describing them
      to the strangers who came to see the abbey; in the history of all and each
      of them he was well read, versed in their noble achievements, their
      triumphs in camp or cabinet. To his eyes they formed a long line of heroic
      characters, of which the world had produced no equal; they realized in his
      conception the proud eulogy of the Bayards, &ldquo;where all the men were brave,
      and all the women virtuous;&rdquo; and it is not improbable that his devotion to
      his master was in a great measure ascribable to that awe-struck admiration
      with which he regarded his glorious ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man stood, and, holding the lamp above his head, gazed in
      respectful admiration at the grim figure of a Knight in armor. There might
      have been little to charm the lover of painting in the execution of the
      picture, and the mere castle-builder could scarcely have indulged his
      fancy in weaving a story from the countenance of the portrait, for the
      vizor was down, and he stood in all the unmoved sternness of his iron
      prison, with his glaived hands elapsed upon the cross of a long straight
      sword. Tate gazed on him for some moments. Heaven knows with what
      qualities of mind or person the old man had endowed him, for while to
      others he was only Sir Gavin Darcy, first Knight of Gwynne, Tate in all
      likelihood had invested him with traits of character and appearance, of
      which that external shell was the mere envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going, Sir Gavin,&rdquo; muttered the old man, as if addressing the
      portrait; &ldquo;&lsquo;tis the ould stock is laving the place, never to see it more;
      &lsquo;t is your own proud heart will be sorry to-day to look down upon us. Ah,
      ah!&rdquo; muttered he, &ldquo;the world is changed; there was times when a Darcy
      would n&rsquo;t quit the house of his fathers without a blow for it&mdash;aud
      they say we are better now!&rdquo; With a heavy sigh he passed on, and stood
      before the next picture. &ldquo;Yes, my Lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;ye may well cry that
      lost the two beautiful boys the same morning, fighting side by side; but
      there&rsquo;s heavier grief here now: the brave youths sleep in peace and in
      honor; but we have no home to shelter us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a slow step and bent-down head, he tottered on, and, placing the lamp
      upon the floor, crossed his arms upon his breast. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis you that can help
      us now,&rdquo; said he as he cast a timid and imploring glance at the goodly
      countenance and rotund figure of Bernhard Emmeric, fourth Abbot of Gwynne;
      &ldquo;&lsquo;tis your reverence can offer a prayer for your own blood that&rsquo;s in sore
      trouble and distress. Do it, my Lord; do it in the name of the Vargin.
      Smiling and happy you look, but it &lsquo;s sorrowful your heart is in you to
      see what&rsquo;s going on here. Them, them was the happy days, when it was n&rsquo;t
      the cry of grief was heard beneath this roof, but the heavenly chants of
      holy men, and the prayers of the blessed mass.&rdquo; He knelt down as he said
      this, and with trembling lips and tearful eyes recited some verses from
      his breviary.
    </p>
    <p>
      This done, he arose, and, as if with renovated courage, proceeded on his
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reginald Herbert de Guyon! ah! second Baron of Gwynne, Lord Protector of
      Munster, Knight of Malta, Chevalier of St. John of Jerusalem,
      Standard-Bearer to the Queen! and well you desarve it all! &lsquo;T is yourself
      sits your horse like a proud nobleman!&rdquo; He stood with eyes riveted upon
      the picture, while his face glowed with intense enthusiasm, and at last,
      as a bitter sneer passed across his lips, he added, &ldquo;Ay, faith! and them
      that comes after us won&rsquo;t like the look of you. &lsquo;T is you that &lsquo;ll never
      disguise from them your real mind, and every day they &lsquo;ll dine in the
      hall, that same frown will darken, and that same hand will threaten them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved on now, and passed several portraits without stopping, muttering
      as he went, &ldquo;&lsquo;T is more English than Irish blood is in your veins, and you
      won&rsquo;t feel as much for us as the rest;&rdquo; then, halting suddenly, he stood
      before a tall figure, dressed in black velvet, with a deep collar of point
      lace. A connoisseur of higher pretensions than poor Tate might have gazed
      with even greater rapture at that splendid canvas, for it was from the
      hand of Vandyke, and in his very best manner. The picture represented the
      person of Sir Everard Darcy, Lord Privy Seal to Charles I. It was a
      specimen of manly beauty and high blood such as the great Fleming loved to
      paint; and even yet the proud and lofty forehead, the deep-set brown eyes,
      the thin compressed lip, the long and somewhat projecting chin, seemed to
      address themselves to the beholder with traits of character more than mere
      painting is able to convey. Tate approached the spot with an almost
      trembling veneration, and bowed deeply before the haughty figure. &ldquo;There
      was a time, Sir Everard, when your word could make a duke or a marquis,&mdash;when
      your whisper in the king&rsquo;s ear could bring grief or joy to any heart in
      the empire. Could you do nothing for us now? They say you never were at a
      loss, no matter what came to pass&mdash;that you were always ready-witted
      to save your master from trouble&mdash;and oh! if the power hasn&rsquo;t left
      you, stand by us now. It is not because your eyes are so bright, and that
      quiet smile is on your lips, that your heart does not feel, for I know
      well that the day you were beheaded you had the same look on you as you
      have now. I think I see you this minute, as you lifted your head off the
      block to settle the lace collar that the villain, the executioner, rumpled
      with his bloody fingers,&mdash;I think I hear the words you spoke: &lsquo;Honest
      Martin, for all your practice, you are but a clumsy valet.&rsquo; Weil, well! &lsquo;t
      is a happier and a prouder day that same than to-morrow&rsquo;s dawn will bring
      to ourselves. Yes, yes, my darlings,&rdquo; said Tate, with a benevolent smile,
      as he waved his hand towards a picture where two beautiful children were
      represented, sitting on the grass, and playing with flowers, &ldquo;be happy and
      amuse yourselves, in God&rsquo;s name; &lsquo;tis the only time for happiness your
      lives ever gave you. Ah! and here &lsquo;s your father, with a smile on his face
      and a cheerful brow, for he had both till the day misfortune robbed him of
      his children;&rdquo; and he stood in front of a portrait of an officer in an
      admiral&rsquo;s uniform. He was a distinguished member of the Darcy family; but
      from the nature of his services, which were all maritime, and the great
      number of years he had spent away from Ireland, possessed less of Tate&rsquo;s
      sympathy than most of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say you didn&rsquo;t like Ireland; but I don&rsquo;t believe them. There never
      was a Darcy did n&rsquo;t love the ould island; but I know well whose fault it
      was if you did n&rsquo;t,&mdash;it was that dark villain that&rsquo;s standing at your
      side, ould Harry Inchiquin, the renegade, that turned many a man against
      his country. Ye may frown and scowl at me; but if you were alive this
      minute, I &lsquo;d say it to your face. It was you that first brought gambling
      and dicing under this blessed roof; it was you that sent the ould acres to
      the hammer; &lsquo;twas you that loved rioting, and duelling, and every
      wickedness, just like old Bagenal Daly himself, that never could sleep in
      his bed if he had n&rsquo;t a fight on hand.&rdquo;
     </p>

      <img src="images/408.jpg" width="100%" alt="408 " />
    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ho! you old reprobate!&rdquo; called out Daly, in a voice which, echoing
      under the arched roof, seemed rather to float through the atmosphere than
      issue from any particular quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! marciful Father!&rdquo; cried Tate, as, falling on his knees, the lamp
      dropped from his fingers, and became extinguished,&mdash;&ldquo;oh! marciful
      Father! sure I did n&rsquo;t mane it; &lsquo;t is what the lying books said of you,&mdash;bad
      luck to the villains that wrote them! O God! pardon me; I never thought
      you &lsquo;d hear me; and if it &lsquo;s in trouble you are, I &lsquo;ll say a mass for you
      every day till Aaster, and one every Friday as long as I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hoarse burst of laughter broke from Daly, while, pacing the gallery with
      heavy tread, he went forth, banging the door behind him. The terror was
      too great for poor Tate&rsquo;s endurance, and, with a faint cry for mercy, he
      rolled down upon the floor almost insensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      When morning broke, he was found seated in the refectory, pale and
      careworn; but no entreaty, nor no pressing, could elicit from him one word
      of a secret in which he believed were equally involved the honor of the
      dead and the safety of himself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV. A GLANCE AT PUBLIC OPINION IN THE YEAR 1800.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Among the arrangements for the departure of the family from the abbey, all
      of which were confided to Bagenal Daly, was one which he pressed with a
      more than ordinary zeal and anxiety; this was, that they should set out at
      a very early hour of the morning,&mdash;at dawn of day, if possible. Lady
      Eleanor&rsquo;s habits made such a plan objectionable, and it was only by
      representing the great sacrifice of feeling a later departure would exact,
      when crowds of country people would assemble to take their farewells of
      them forever, that she consented. While Daly depicted the unnecessary
      sorrow to which they would expose themselves by the sight of their old and
      attached tenantry, he strenuously preserved silence on the real reason
      which actuated him, and to explain which a brief glance at the state of
      public feeling at the period is necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      To such a pitch of acrimony and animosity were parties borne by the
      agitation which preceded the carrying of the &ldquo;Union,&rdquo; that all previous
      character and conduct of those who voted on the question were deemed as
      nothing in comparison with the line they adopted on the one absorbing
      subject. If none who advocated the Ministerial plan escaped the foulest
      animadversions, all who espoused the opposite side were exalted to the
      dignity of patriots; argument and reason went for little, principle for
      still less: a vote was deemed the touchstone of honesty. Such rash and
      hasty judgments suited the temper of the times, and, it may be said in
      extenuation, were not altogether without some show of reason. Each day
      revealed some desertion from the popular party of men who, up to that
      moment, had rejected all the seductions of the Crown; country gentlemen,
      hitherto supposed inaccessible to all the temptations of bribery, were
      found suddenly addressing speculative letters to their constituencies,
      wherein they ingeniously discussed all the contingencies of a measure they
      had once opposed without qualification. Noblemen of high rank and fortune
      were seen to pay long visits at the Castle, and, by a strange fatality,
      were found to have modified their opinions exactly at the period selected
      by the Crown to bestow on them designations of honor or situations of
      trust and dignity. Lawyers in high practice at the bar, men esteemed by
      their profession, and held in honor by the public, were seen to abandon
      their position of proud independence, and accept Government appointments,
      in many cases inferior both in profit and rank to what they had
      surrendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed a kind of panic abroad. Men feared to walk without the
      protective mantle of the Crown being extended over them; the barriers of
      shame were broken down by the extent to which corruption had spread. The
      examples of infamy were many, and several were reconciled to the ignominy
      of their degradation by their associates in disgrace. That in such general
      corruption the judgments of the public should have been equally wholesale,
      is little to be wondered at; the regret is rather that they were so rarely
      unjust and ill-bestowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Public confidence was utterly uprooted; there was a national bankruptcy of
      honor, and none were trusted; all the guarantees for high principle and
      rectitude a lifetime had given, all the hostages to good faith years of
      unimpeached honor bestowed, were forgotten in a moment, and such as
      opposed the Government measure with less of acrimony or activity than
      their neighbors, were set down &ldquo;as waiting for or soliciting the bribery
      of the Crown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this indiscriminating censure the Knight of Gwynne was a victim. It may
      be remarked that in times of popular excitement, when passions are rife
      and the rude enthusiasm of the mass has beaten down the more calmly
      weighed opinion of the few, that there is a strange pleasure felt in the
      detection of any real or supposed lapse of one once esteemed. It were well
      if this malignant delight were limited to the mere mob, but it is not so;
      men of education and position are not exempt from its taint. It would seem
      as if society were so thoroughly disorganized that every feeling was
      perverted, and all the esteem for what is good and great had degenerated
      into a general cry of exultation over each new instance of tarnished
      honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accustomed as we now are to the most free and unfettered criticisms of all
      public men and their acts, it would yet astonish any one not conversant
      with that period, to look back to the newspapers of the time, and see the
      amount of violence and personality with which every man obnoxious to a
      party was visited; coarse invective stood in the place of argument, a
      species of low humor had replaced the light brilliancy of wit. The public
      mind, fed on grosser materials, had lost all appetite for the piquancy of
      more highly flavored food, and the purveyors were not sorry to find a
      market for a commodity which cost them so little to procure. In this
      spirit was it that one of the most popular of the Opposition journals
      announced for the amusement of its readers a series of sketches under the
      title of &ldquo;The Gallery of Traitors,&rdquo;&mdash;a supposed collection of
      portraits to be painted for the Viceroy, and destined to decorate one of
      the chambers of the Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not satisfied with aspersing the reputation, and mistaking the views of
      any who sided with the Minister, the attack went further, and actually
      ascribed the casualties which occurred to such persons or their families
      as instances of divine vengeance. In this diabolical temper the Knight of
      Gwynne was held up to reprobation; it was a bold thought to venture on
      calumniating a man every action of whose life had placed him above even
      slander, but its boldness was the warranty of success. The whole story of
      his arrival in Dublin, his dinner with the Secretary, his intimacy with
      Heffernan, was related circumstantially. The night on which Heffernan
      entrapped him by the trick already mentioned, was quoted as the eventful
      moment of his change. Then came the history of his appearance in the House
      on the evening of the second reading: his hesitation to enter, his doubts
      and waverings were all described, ending with a minute detail of his
      compact with Lord Castlereagh, by which his voting was dispensed with, and
      his absence from the division deemed enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gleeson&rsquo;s flight and its consequences were soon known. The ruin of Darcy&rsquo;s
      large fortune was a circumstance not likely to lose by public discussion,
      particularly when the daily columns of a newspaper devoted a considerable
      space to the most minute details of that catastrophe. It was asserted that
      the Knight had sold himself for a Marqui-sate and a seat in the English
      peerage; that his vote was deemed so great a prize by the Minister that he
      might have made even higher terms, but in the confidence of possessing a
      large fortune he had only bargained for rank, and rejected every offer of
      mere emolument; and now came the dreadful retribution on his treachery,
      the downfall of his fortune by the villany of his agent. To assume a title
      when the very expense of the patent could not be borne, was an absurdity,
      and this explained why Maurice Darcy remained ungazetted. Such was the
      plausible calumny generally circulated, and, alas for the sake of charity!
      scarcely less generally believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are epidemics of credulity as of infidelity, and such a plague raged
      at this period. Anything was believed, were it only bad enough. While men,
      therefore, went about deploring, with all the sanctity of self-esteem, the
      fall of Maurice Darcy, public favor, by one of those caprices all its own,
      adopted the cause of his colleague, Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly. His noble refusal of
      every offer (and what a catalogue of seductions did they not enumerate!)
      was given in the largest type. They recounted, with all the eloquence of
      their calling, the glittering coronets rejected, the places of honor and
      profit declined, the dignities proffered in vain, preferring as he did the
      untitled rank of a country gentleman, and the unpurchasable station of a
      true friend to Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was eulogized in capital letters, and canonized among the martyrs of
      patriotism; public orators belabored him with praises, and ballad-singers
      chanted his virtues through the streets. Nor was this turn of feeling a
      thing to be neglected by one so shrewd in worldly matters. His sudden
      accession to increased fortune and the position attendant on it, would, he
      well knew, draw down upon him many a sneer upon his origin, and some
      unpleasant allusions to the means by which the wealth was amassed. To
      anticipate such an ungrateful inquiry, he seized the lucky accident of his
      popularity, and turned it to the best account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whole &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; were devoted to the laudation of his character: the
      provincial journals, less scrupulous than the metropolitan, boldly
      asserted their knowledge of the various bribes tendered to him, and threw
      out dark hints of certain disclosures which, although at present refrained
      from out of motives of delicacy, should Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly ultimately be
      persuaded to make, the public would be horrified at the extent to which
      corruption had been carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The O&rsquo;Reilly liveries, hitherto a modest snuff color, were now changed to
      an emerald green; an Irish motto ornamented the garter of the family
      crest; while the very first act of his return to the West was a splendid
      donation to the chapel of Ballyraggan, or, as it was subsequently and more
      politely named, the Church of St. Barnabas of Treves: all measures
      dictated by a high-spirited independence, and a mind above the vulgar
      bigotry of party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had O&rsquo;Reilly stopped here; had he contented himself with the preliminary
      arrangements for being a patriot, it is probable that Bagenal Daly had
      never noticed them, or done so merely with some passing sarcasm; but the
      fact was otherwise. Daly discovered, in the course of his journey
      westward, that the rumors of the Knight&rsquo;s betrayal of his party were
      generally disseminated in exact proportion with the new-born popularity of
      O&rsquo;Reilly; that the very town of Westport, where Darcy&rsquo;s name was once
      adored, was actually placarded with insulting notices of the Knight&rsquo;s
      conduct, and scandalous aspersions on his character: jeering allusions to
      his altered fortunes were sung in the villages as he passed along, and it
      was plain that the whole current of popular opinion had set strong against
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To spare his friend Darcy a mortification which Daly well knew would be
      one of the greatest to his feelings, the early departure was planned and
      decided on. It must not be inferred that because the Knight would have
      felt deeply the unjust censure of the masses, he was a man to care or bend
      beneath the angry menace of a mob; far from it. The ingratitude towards
      himself would have called forth the least of his regrets; it was rather a
      heartfelt sorrow at the hopeless ignorance and degradation of those who
      could be so easily deceived,&mdash;at that populace whose fickleness
      preferred the tinsel and trappings of patriotism to the acts and opinions
      of one they had known and respected for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before day broke, Daly was stirring and busied with all the
      preparations of the journey; the travelling carriage, covered with its
      various boxes and imperials, stood before the door in the courtyard; the
      horses were harnessed and bridled in the stables; everything was in
      readiness for a start; and yet, save himself and the stablemen, all within
      the abbey seemed buried in slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it was scarcely more than five o&rsquo;clock, Daly&rsquo;s impatience at the
      continued quietude around him began to manifest itself; he walked hastily
      to and fro, endeavoring to occupy his thoughts by a hundred little
      details, till at last he found himself returning to the same places and
      with the self-same objects again and again, while he muttered broken
      sentences of angry comments on people who could sleep so soundly at such a
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in one of those fretful moods he had approached the little
      flower-garden of the sub-prior&rsquo;s house, when the twinkling of a light
      attracted him: it came from the window of Lady Eleanor&rsquo;s favorite
      drawing-room, and glittered like a star in the gloom of the morning.
      Curious to see who was stirring in that part of the house, he drew near,
      and, opening the wicket, noiselessly approached the window. He there
      beheld Lady Eleanor, who, supported by Helen&rsquo;s arm, moved slowly along the
      room, stopping at intervals, and again proceeding; she seemed to be taking
      a last farewell of the various well-known objects endeared to her by years
      of companionship; her handkerchief was often raised to her eyes as she
      went, but neither uttered a syllable. Ashamed to have obtruded even thus
      upon a scene of private sorrow, Daly turned back again to the courtyard,
      where now the loud voice of the Knight was heard giving his orders to the
      servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first greetings over, the Knight took Daly&rsquo;s arm and walked beside
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking over the matter in the night, Bagenal,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;and am convinced it were far better that you should remain with Lionel;
      we can easily make our journey alone,&mdash;the road is open, and no
      difficulty in following it; but that poor boy will need advice and
      counsel. You will probably receive letters from Dublin by the post, with
      some instructions how to act; in any case my heart fails me at leaving
      Lionel to himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll remain, then,&rdquo; replied Daly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you the first stage out of
      Westport, and then return here. It is, perhaps, better as you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is another point,&rdquo; said Darcy, after a pause, and with evident
      hesitation in his manner; &ldquo;it is perfectly impossible for me to walk
      through this labyrinth without your guidance, Bagenal,&mdash;I have
      neither head nor heart for it,&mdash;you must be the pilot, and if you
      quit the helm for a moment&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust me, Maurice, I&rsquo;ll not do it,&rdquo; said Daly, grasping his hand with a
      firm grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that well,&rdquo; said the Knight, as his voice trembled with agitation;
      &ldquo;I never doubted the will, Bagenal, it was the power only I suspected. I
      see you will not understand me. Confound it! why should old friends, such
      as we are, keep beating about the bush, or fencing like a pair of
      diplomatists? I wanted to speak to you about that bond of yours: there is
      something like seven thousand pounds lying to my credit at Henshaw&rsquo;s; take
      what is necessary, and get rid of that scoundrel Hickman&rsquo;s claim. If they
      should arrest you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he had done so yesterday,&mdash;my infernal temper, that never
      will let matters take due course, stopped the fellow; you can&rsquo;t see why,
      but I&rsquo;ll tell you. I paid the money to Hickman&rsquo;s law-agent, in Dublin, the
      morning I started from town, and they had not time to stop the execution
      of the writ down here. Yes, Darcy, there was one drop more in the stoup,
      and I drained it! The last few acres I possessed in the world, the old
      estate of Hardress Daly, is now in the ownership of one Samuel Kerney,
      grocer of Bride Street. I paid off Hickman, however, and found something
      like one hundred and twenty-eight pounds afterwards in my pocket&mdash;but
      let us talk of something else: you must not yield to these people without
      a struggle; Bicknell says there are abundant grounds for a trial at bar in
      the affair. If collusion between Hickman and Gleeson should be proved,
      that many of the leases were granted with false signatures annexed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll do whatever men of credit and character counsel me,&rdquo; said the
      Knight; &ldquo;if there be any question of right, I &lsquo;ll neither compromise nor
      surrender it: I can promise no more. But here comes Lionel,&mdash;to
      announce breakfast, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so it was; the young man came towards them with an easy smile,
      presenting a hand to each. If sorrow had sunk deeply into his heart, few
      traces of grief were apparent in his manly, handsome countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the efforts of the party, the breakfast did not pass over
      as lightly as the dinner of the previous day; the eventful moment of
      parting was now too near not to exclude every other subject, and even when
      by an exertion some allusion to a different topic would be made, a chance
      question, the entrance of a servant for orders, or the tramp of horses in
      the courtyard, would suddenly bring back the errant thoughts, and place
      the sad reality in all its force before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast was over, and yet no one stirred; a heavy, dreary revery seemed
      to have settled on all except Daly,&mdash;and he, from delicacy,
      restrained the impatience that was working within him. In vain he sought
      to catch Darcy&rsquo;s eye, and then Lionel&rsquo;s,&mdash;both were bent downward.
      Lady Eleanor at last looked up, and at once seemed to read what was
      passing in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; said she, in a low, gentle voice, &ldquo;and I see Mr. Daly is not
      sorry at it. Helen, dearest, fetch me my gloves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She arose, and the others with her. The calmness in which she spoke on the
      theme that none dared approach, seemed also to electrify them, when
      suddenly a low sob was heard, and the mother fell, in a burst of anguish,
      into the arms of her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eleanor, my dearest Eleanor!&rdquo; said Darcy, as his pale cheek shook and his
      lip trembled. As if recalled to herself by the words, she raised her head,
      and, with a smile of deep-meaning sorrow, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first tear I have yet shed; it shall be the last.&rdquo; Then, taking
      Daly&rsquo;s arm, she walked steadily forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have often wondered,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;at the prayer of a condemned felon for
      a few hours longer of life; but I can understand it now. I feel as if I
      could give life itself for another day within these walls, where often I
      have pined with <i>ennui</i>. You will watch over Lionel for me, Mr. Daly.
      When the world went fairly with us, calamities came softened,&mdash;as the
      summer rain falls lighter in sunshine; but now, now that we have lost so
      much, we cannot afford more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daly&rsquo;s stern features grew sterner and darker; his lips were compressed
      more firmly; he tried to say a few words, but a low, indistinct muttering
      was all that came.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment the carriage door was closed on the party&mdash;they were
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lionel stood gazing after them till they disappeared, and then, with a
      slow step, re-entered the abbey.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. BAGENAL DALY&rsquo;S RETURN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lionel Darcy bore up manfully against his altered fortunes so long as
      others were around him, and that the necessity for exertion existed; but
      once more alone within that silent and deserted house, all his courage
      failed him at once, and he threw himself upon a seat and gave way to
      grief. Never were the brighter prospects of opening life more cruelly
      dashed, and yet his sorrow was for others. Every object about brought up
      thoughts of that dear mother and sister, to whom the refinements of life
      were less luxuries than wants. How were they to engage in the stern
      conflict with daily poverty,&mdash;to see themselves bereft of all the
      appliances which filled up the hours of each day? Could his mother, frail
      and delicate as she was, much longer sustain the effort by which she first
      met the stroke of fortune? Would not the reaction, whenever it came, be
      too terrible to be borne? And Helen, too,&mdash;his sweet and lovely
      sister,&mdash;she whom he had loved to think of as the admired of a
      splendid Court; on whose appearance in the world he had so often
      speculated, castle-building over the sensations her beauty and her
      gracefulness would excite,&mdash;what was to be her lot? Deep and
      heartfelt as his sorrow was for them, it was only when he thought of his
      father that Lionel&rsquo;s anguish burst its bounds, and he broke into a torrent
      of tears. From very boyhood he had loved and admired him; but never had
      the high features of his character so impressed Lionel Darcy as when the
      reverse of fortune called up that noble spirit whose courage displayed
      itself in manly submission and the generous effort to support the hearts
      of others. How cruel did the decrees of fate seem to him, that such a man
      should be visited so heavily, while vice and meanness prospered on every
      side. He knew not that virtue has no nobler attribute than its power of
      sustaining unmerited affliction, and that the destiny of the good man is
      never more nobly carried out than when he points the example of patience
      in suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immersed in such gloomy thoughts, he wandered on from room to room,
      feeding, as it were, the appetite for sorrow, by the sight of every object
      that could remind him of past happiness; nor were they few. There was the
      window-seat he loved to sit in as a boy, when all the charm of some
      high-wrought story could not keep his eyes from wandering at intervals
      over the green hills where the lambs were playing, or adown by that dark
      stream where circling eddies marked the leaping trout. Here was Helen&rsquo;s
      favorite room, a little octagon boudoir, from every window of which a
      different prospect opened; it seemed to breathe of her sweet presence even
      yet; the open desk, from which she had taken some letter, lay there upon
      the table, the pen she had last touched, the chair she sat upon, all, even
      to the little nosegay of scarce-faded flowers, the last she had plucked,
      teemed with her memory. He walked on with bent-down head and tardy step,
      and entered the little room which, opening on the lawn, was used by the
      Knight to receive such of the tenantry as came to him for assistance or
      advice; many an hour had he sat there beside his father, and, while
      listening with the eager curiosity of youth to the little stories of the
      poor man&rsquo;s life, his trials and his difficulties, imbibed lessons of
      charity and benevolence never to be forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great square volume in which the Knight used to record his notes of
      the neighboring poor, lay on the table; his chair was placed near it; all
      was in readiness for his coming who was to come there no more! As Lionel
      stood in silent sorrow, surveying these objects, the shadow of a man
      darkened the window. He turned suddenly, and saw the tall, scarecrow
      figure of Flury the madman. A large placard decorated the front of his
      hat, on which the words &ldquo;Down with the Darcys!&rdquo; were written in capital
      letters, and he carried in his hand a bundle of papers, like handbills,
      which he shook with a menacing air at Lionel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this, Flury?&rdquo; said the youth, opening the window, and at the same
      time snatching one of the papers from his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the full account of the grand auction of Government hacks,&rdquo; said
      Flury, with the sing-song intonation of a street-crier, &ldquo;no longer needed
      for the services of the Crown, and to be sowld without resarve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who sent you here with this?&rdquo; said the young man, moderating his
      tone, to avoid startling the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connor Egan, Hickman&rsquo;s man, gave me a pint and a noggin of spirits to cry
      the auction, and tould me to come up here and maybe you&rsquo;d like to hear of
      it ye&rsquo;selves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lionel threw his eyes over the offensive lines, where in coarse ribaldry
      names the most venerable were held up to scorn and derision. If it was
      some satisfaction to find that his father was linked in the ruffianly
      attack with men of honor as unblemished as his own, he was not less
      outraged at the vindictive cowardice that had suggested this insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a fine sight of people there, by all accounts,&rdquo; said Flury,
      gravely, &ldquo;for the auction-bills is far and near over the country, and the
      Castlebar coach has one on each door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is popular feeling always as corrupt a thing as this?&rdquo; muttered Lionel,
      with a bitter sneer, while at the same time the door of the room was
      opened, and Daly entered. His face was marked by a severe cut on one
      cheek, from which the blood had flowed freely; a dark blue stain, as of a
      blow, was on his chin, and one hand he carried enveloped in his
      handkerchief; his clothes were torn besides in many places, and bore
      traces of a severe personal conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; said Lionel, as he looked in alarm at the swollen and
      blood-stained features. &ldquo;Did you fall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fall! no such thing, boy,&rdquo; replied Daly, sternly; &ldquo;but some worthy folk
      in Castlebar planned a little surprise for me this morning. They heard, it
      seems, that we passed through the town by daybreak, but that I was to
      return before noon; and so they placed some cars and turf creels in the
      main street, opposite the inn, in such a way that, while seeming merely
      accident, would effectually stop a horseman from proceeding. When I
      arrived at the spot, I halted, and called out to the fellows to move on,
      and let me pass. They took no heed of my words, and then I saw in a moment
      what was intended. I had no arms; I had purposely left my pistols behind
      me, for I feared something might provoke me, though not anticipating such
      as this. So I got down and drew this wattle from the side of a turf creel,&mdash;you
      see it is a strong blackthorn, and good stuff too. Before I was in the
      saddle the word was passed, and the whole street was full of people, and I
      now perceived that, by the same manouvre as they employed in front, they
      had also closed the rear upon me, and cut off my retreat. &lsquo;Now for it! now
      for it!&rsquo; they shouted. &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Bully Dodd?&mdash;Where&rsquo;s the Bully?&rsquo; I
      suppose you know the fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man that was transported?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same. The greatest ruffian the country was cursed with. He came at
      the call, without coat or waistcoat, his shirt-sleeves tucked up to his
      shoulders, and a handkerchief round his waist ready for a fight. There was
      an old quarrel between us, for it was I captured the fellow the day after
      he burnt down Dawson&rsquo;s house. He came towards me, the mob opening a way
      for him, with a pewter pot of porter in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We want you to dhrink a toast for us, Mr. Daly,&rsquo; said he, with a marked
      courtesy, and a grin that amused the fellows around him. &lsquo;You were always
      a patriot, and won&rsquo;t make any objections to it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What is the liquor?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Good porter,&mdash;divil a less,&rsquo; cried the mob; &lsquo;Mol Heavyside&rsquo;s best.&rsquo;
      And so I took the vessel in my hands, and before they could say a
      syllable, drained it to the bottom; for I was very thirsty with the ride,
      and in want of something to refresh myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But you did n&rsquo;t dhrink the toast,&rsquo; said Dodd savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Where was the toast? He didn&rsquo;t say the words,&rsquo; shouted the mob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Off with his hat, and make him drink it,&rsquo; cried out several others from
      a distance. They saved me one part of the trouble, for they knocked off my
      hat with a stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s health and long life to Hickman O&rsquo;Reilly!&rsquo; cried out Dodd,&mdash;&lsquo;that&rsquo;s
      the toast.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And what have I to wish him either?&rsquo; said I, while at the same time I
      tore open the pewter measure, and then with one strong dash of my band
      drove it down on the ruffian&rsquo;s head, down to the very brows. I lost no
      time afterwards, but, striking right and left, plunged forwards; the mob
      fled as I followed, and by good luck the carthorses, getting frightened,
      sprang forward also, and so I rode on with a few slight cuts; a stone or
      two struck me, nothing more; but they &lsquo;ll need a plumber to rid my friend
      Dodd of his helmet.&rdquo;

    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we used to call this town our own,&rdquo; said Lionel, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is a man&rsquo;s own but his honor, sir. That base cowardice yonder
      believes itself honest and independent, as if a single right feeling, a
      single good or virtuous thought, could consort with habits like theirs;
      but they are less base than those who instigate them. The real scoundrels
      are the Hickmans of this world, the men who compensate for low birth and
      plebeian origin by calumniating the wellborn and the noble.&mdash;What is
      Flury wanting here?&rdquo; said he, as, attracted by Daly&rsquo;s narrative, the poor
      fellow had drawn near to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I &lsquo;m glad you put the pewter pot on the Bully&rsquo;s head, he &lsquo;s a disgrace
      to the town,&rdquo; said Flury, with a laugh; and he turned away, as if enjoying
      the downfall of an enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I see,&rdquo; said Daly, taking up one of the papers that had fallen to the
      ground, &ldquo;this is the first act of the drama. Come along, Lionel, let us
      talk of matters nearer to our hearts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked along together to the library, each silently following his own
      train of thought, and for some time neither seemed disposed to speak.
      Lionel at length broke silence, as he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking over it, and am convinced my father will never be
      able to endure this life of inactivity before him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly the fear I entertain myself for him; altered fortunes
      will impress themselves more in the diminished sphere to which his
      influence and utility will be reduced, than in anything else: but how to
      remedy this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been considering that also; but you must advise me if the plan be
      a likely one. He held the rank of colonel once&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure he did, and with good right,&mdash;he raised the regiment
      himself. Darcy&rsquo;s Light Horse were as handsome a set of fellows as the
      service could boast of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, my notion is, that although the Government did not buy his
      vote on the Union, there would be no just reason why they should not
      appoint him to some one of those hundred situations which the service
      includes. His former rank, his connection and position, his unmerited
      misfortunes, are, in some sense, claims. I can scarcely suppose his
      opposition in Parliament would be remembered against him at such a
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly think it would,&rdquo; said Daly, musingly; &ldquo;there is much in what you
      propose. Would Lord Netherby support such a request if it were made?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He could not well decline it; almost the last thing he said at parting
      was, that whatever favor he enjoyed should be gladly employed in our
      behalf. Besides, we really seek nothing to which we may not lay fair and
      honest claim. My intention would be to write at once to Lord Netherby.
      acquainting him briefly with our altered fortunes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more briefly on that topic the better,&rdquo; said Daly, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To mention my father&rsquo;s military rank and services, to state that, having
      raised and equipped a company at his own expense, without accepting the
      slightest aid from the Government, now, in his present change of
      condition, he would be proud of any recognition of those services which
      once he was but too happy to render unrewarded by the Crown. There are
      many positions, more or less lucrative, which would well become him, and
      which no right-minded gentleman could say were ill-bestowed on such a
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All true,&rdquo; said Daly, whose eye brightened as he gazed on the youth,
      whose character seemed already about to develop itself under the pressure
      of misfortune with traits of more thoughtful meaning than yet appeared iu
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will write to Lord Netherby at once,&rdquo; resumed Lionel; &ldquo;there can
      be no indelicacy in making such a request: he is our relative, the nearest
      my mother has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is far better, he &lsquo;s a Lord in Waiting, and a very subtle courtier,&rdquo;
       said Daly. &ldquo;Write this day, and, if you like it, I &lsquo;ll dictate the
      letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lionel accepted the offer with all the pleasure possible. He had been from
      boyhood a firm believer in the resources and skill of Daly in every
      possible contingency of life, and looked on him as one of those persons
      who invariably succeed when everybody else fails.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a species of promptitude in action, the fruit generally of a
      strong will and a quick imagination, which young men mistake for a much
      higher gift, and estimate at a price very far above its value. Bagenal
      Daly had, however, other qualities than these; but truth compels us to own
      that, in Lionel&rsquo;s eyes, his supremacy on such grounds was no small merit.
      He had ever found him ready for every emergency, prompt to decide, no less
      quick to act, and, without stopping to inquire how far success followed
      such rapid resolves, this very energy charmed him. It was, then, in
      perfect confidence in the skill and address of his adviser that Lionel sat
      down, pen in hand, to write at his dictation.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI. THE LAW AND ITS CHANCES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We left Mr. Daly at the conclusion of our last chapter in the exercise of&mdash;what
      to him was always a critical matter&mdash;the functions of a polite
      letter-writer. His faults, it is but justice to say, were much less those
      of style than of the individual himself; for if he rarely failed to convey
      a clear notion of his views and intentions, he still more rarely omitted
      to impart considerable insight into his own character.
    </p>
    <p>
      His abrupt and broken sentences, his sudden outbreaks of intelligence or
      passion, were not inaptly conveyed by the character of a handwriting which
      was bold, careless, and hurried. Indifferent to everything like neatness
      or accuracy, generally blotted, and never very legible, these defects, if
      they did not palliate, they might, in a measure, explain something of his
      habits of thought and action; but now, when about to dictate to another,
      the case was different, and those interruptions which Daly would have set
      down by a dash of his pen, were to be conveyed by the less significant
      medium of mere blanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m ready,&rdquo; said Lionel, at length, as he sat for some time in silent
      expectation of Daly&rsquo;s commencement. But that gentleman was walking up and
      down the room with his hands behind his back, occasionally stopping to
      look out upon the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, begin&mdash;&lsquo;My dear Lord Netherby,&rsquo; or &lsquo;My dear Lord,&rsquo;&mdash;it
      does n&rsquo;t signify which, though I suppose he would be of another mind, and
      find a whole world of difference between the two. Have you that?&mdash;very
      well. Then go on to mention, in such terms as you like yourself, the
      sudden change of fortune that has befallen your family,&mdash;briefly, but
      decisively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dictate it, I&rsquo;ll follow you,&rdquo; said Lionel, somewhat put out by this mode
      of composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it doesn&rsquo;t matter exactly what the words are,&mdash;say, that a d&mdash;&mdash;d
      scoundrel, Gleeson&mdash;Honest Tom we always called him&mdash;has cut and
      run with something like a hundred thousand pounds, after forging and
      falsifying every signature to our leases for the last ten or fifteen
      years; we are, in consequence, ruined&mdash;obliged to leave the abbey,
      take to a cottage&mdash;a devilish poor one, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go so fast&mdash;&lsquo;we are in consequence&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Utterly smashed&mdash;broken up&mdash;no home, and devilish little to
      live upon,&mdash;my mother&rsquo;s jointure being barely sufficient for herself
      and Helen. I want, therefore, to remind you&mdash;your Lordship, that is&mdash;to
      remind your Lordship of the kind pledge which you so lately made us, at a
      time when we little anticipated the early necessity we should have to
      recall it. My father, some forty-five or six years back, raised the Darcy
      Light Horse, equipped, armed, and mounted six hundred men, at his own
      expense. This regiment, of which he took the head, did good service in the
      Low Countries, and although distinguished in many actions, he received
      nothing but thanks,&mdash;happily not wanting more, if so much. Times are
      changed now with him, and it would be a seasonable act of kindness and a
      suitable reward to an old officer&mdash;highly esteemed as he is and has
      been through life&mdash;to make up for past neglect by some appointment&mdash;the
      service has many such&mdash;Confound them! the pension-list shows what
      fellows there are&mdash;&lsquo;governors and deputy-governors,&rsquo; &lsquo;acting
      adjutants&rsquo; of this, and &lsquo;deputy assistant commissaries&rsquo; of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m not to write that, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you needn&rsquo;t,&mdash;it would do no harm, though, to give them a hint
      on the subject; but never mind it now. &lsquo;As for myself, I &lsquo;ll leave the
      Guards, and take service in the Line. I am only anxious for a regiment on
      a foreign station, and if in India, so much the better.&rsquo; Is that down?
      Well&mdash;eh! that will do, I think. You may just say, that the matter
      ought to be arranged without any communication with your father, inasmuch
      as, from motives of delicacy, he might feel bound to decline what was
      tendered as an offer, though he would hold himself pledged to accept what
      was called by the name of duty. Yes, Lionel, that&rsquo;s the way to put the
      case; active service, by all means active service,&mdash;no guard-mounting
      at Windsor or Carlton House; no Hounslow Heath engagements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lionel followed, as well as he was able, the suggestions, to which sundry
      short interjections and broken &ldquo;hems!&rdquo; and &ldquo;ha&rsquo;s!&rdquo; gave no small
      confusion, and at last finished a letter, which, if it conveyed some part
      of the intention, was even a stronger exponent of the character, of him
      who dictated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I read it over to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid! If you did, I &lsquo;d alter every word of it. I never
      reconsidered a note that I did not change my mind about it, and I don&rsquo;t
      believe I ever counted a sum of money over more than once without making
      the tot vary each time. Send it off as it is&mdash;&rsquo; Yours truly, Lionel
      Darcy.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was about ten days after the events we have just related that Bagenal
      Daly sat in consultation with Darcy&rsquo;s lawyer in the back parlor of the
      Knight&rsquo;s Dublin residence. Lionel, who had been in conclave with them for
      several hours, had just left the room, and they now remained in thoughtful
      silence, pondering over their late discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That young man,&rdquo; said Bicknell, at length, &ldquo;is very far from being
      deficient in ability, but he is wayward and reckless as the rest of the
      family; he seems to have signed his name everywhere they told him, and to
      anything. Here are leases forever at nominal rents&mdash;no fines in
      renewal&mdash;rights of fishery disposed of&mdash;oak timber&mdash;marble
      quarries&mdash;property of every kind&mdash;made away with. Never was
      there such wasteful, ruinous expenditure coupled with peculation and
      actual robbery at the same time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; said Daly, interrupting a catalogue of disasters he
      could scarcely listen to with patience; &ldquo;have you anything to propose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must move in Equity for an inquiry into the validity of these
      documents; many of the signatures are probably false; we can lay a case
      for a jury&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want to hear the details,&mdash;you mean to go to law; now,
      has Darcy wherewithal to sustain a suit? These Hickmans are rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very wealthy people indeed,&rdquo; said Bicknell, dryly. &ldquo;The Knight cannot
      engage in a legal contest with them without adequate means. I am not
      sufficiently in possession of Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s resources to pronounce on the
      safety of such a step.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you, then: they have nothing left to live upon save his wife&rsquo;s
      jointure. Lady Eleanor has something like a thousand a year in settlement,&mdash;certainly
      not more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they can contrive to live on half this sum,&rdquo; said the lawyer,
      cautiously, &ldquo;we may, perhaps, find the remainder enough for our purposes.
      The first expenses will be, of course, very heavy: drafts to prepare,
      searches to make, witnesses to examine, with opinion of high counsel, will
      all demand considerable outlay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a point I can give no opinion upon,&rdquo; said Daly; &ldquo;they have been
      accustomed to live surrounded with luxuries of every kind: whether they
      can at once descend to actual poverty, or would rather cling to the
      remnant of their former comforts, is not in my power to tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very bond under which they have foreclosed,&rdquo; said Bicknell, &ldquo;admits
      of great question. Unfortunately, that fellow Gleeson destroyed all the
      papers before his suicide, or we could ascertain if a clause of redemption
      were not inserted; there was no registry of the judgment, and we are
      consequently in the hands of the enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot help saying,&rdquo; said Daly, sternly, &ldquo;that if it were not for the
      confounded subtleties of your craft, roguery would have a less profitable
      sphere of employment: so many hitches, so many small crotchety
      conjunctures influence the mere question of right and wrong that a man is
      led at last to think less of justice itself than of the petty artifices to
      secure a superiority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must assure you that you are in a great error,&rdquo; said Bicknell, calmly;
      &ldquo;the complication of a suit is the necessary security the law has recourse
      to against the wiles and stratagems of designing men. What you call its
      hitches and subtleties are the provisions against craft by which mere
      honesty is protected: that they are sometimes employed to defeat justice,
      is saying no more than that they are only human contrivances; for what
      good institution cannot be so perverted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better, if you can think so. Now, what are Darcy&rsquo;s chances of
      success?&mdash;never mind recapitulating details, which remind me a great
      deal too much of my own misfortunes, but say, in one word, is the prospect
      good or bad, or has it a tinge of both?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be any of the three, according to the way in which the claim is
      prosecuted; if there be sufficient means&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the great question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly; large fees to the leading counsel, retainers, if a record be
      kept for trial at the Assizes, and payment to special juries: all are
      expensive, and all necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ll write to Darcy to-night, then,&mdash;or, better still, I &lsquo;ll write
      to Lady Eleanor, repeating what you have told me, and asking her advice
      and opinion; meanwhile, lose no time in consulting Mr. Boyle,&mdash;you
      prefer him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, in a case like this he cannot be surpassed; besides, he is
      already well acquainted with all the leading facts, and has taken a deep
      interest in the affair. There are classes and gradations of ability at the
      bar, irrespective of degrees of actual capacity; we have the heavy
      artillery of the Equity Court, the light field-pieces of the King&rsquo;s Bench,
      and the Congreve rockets of Assize display: to misplace or confound them
      would be a grave error.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know where I &lsquo;d put them all, if <i>my</i> pleasure were to be
      consulted,&rdquo; muttered Daly, in an undergrowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, if we have a case for a jury, we must secure Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He who made a speech to the mob in Smithfield the other day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same. I perceive you scarcely approve of my suggestion; but his
      success at the bar is very considerable: he knows a good deal of law, and
      a great deal more about mankind. A rising man, sir, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be in a falling state of society, then,&rdquo; said Daly, bitterly.
      &ldquo;Time was when the first requisite of a barrister was to be a gentleman.
      An habitual respect for the decorous observances of polite life was deemed
      an essential in one whose opinions were as often to be listened to in
      questions of right feeling as of right doing. His birth, his social
      position, and his acquirements were the guarantees he gave the world that,
      while discussing subtleties, he would not be seduced into anything low or
      unworthy. I am sorry that notion has become antiquated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not surely exclude men of high talents from a career because
      their origin was humble?&rdquo; said Bicknell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not, sir? Upon what principle was the bodyguard of noble persons
      selected to surround the person of the sovereign, save that blood was
      deemed the best security for allegiance? And why should not the law, only
      second in sacred respect to the person of the monarch, be as rigidly
      protected? The Church excludes from her ministry all who, even by physical
      defect, may suggest matter of ridicule or sarcasm to the laity; for the
      same reason I would reject from all concern with the administration of
      justice those coarser minds whose habits familiarize them with vulgar
      tastes and low standards of opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess this seems to me very questionable doctrine, not to speak of
      the instances which the law exhibits of her brightest ornaments derived
      from the very humblest walks in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such cases are probably esteemed the more because of that very reason,&rdquo;
       said Daly, haughtily; &ldquo;they are like the pearl in the oyster-shell, not
      very remarkable in itself, but one must go so low down to seek for it. I
      have an excuse for warmth; I have lost the greater part of a large fortune
      in contesting a right pronounced by high authority to be incontrovertible.
      Besides,&rdquo; added he, with a courteous smile, &ldquo;if Mr. Bicknell may oppose my
      opinion, he has the undoubted superiority that attaches to liberality, his
      own family claiming alliance with the best in the land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This happy turn seemed to divert the course of a conversation which half
      threatened angrily. Again the business topic was resumed, and after a
      short discussion, Bicknell took his leave, while Daly prepared to write
      his letter to Lady Eleanor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not proceeded far in his task when Lionel entered with a newspaper
      in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard the news of the notorious robber being taken?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who do you mean? Barrington, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Freney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Freney! taken?&mdash;when&mdash;how&mdash;where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s curious enough,&rdquo; said Lionel, coolly, seating himself to read the
      paragraph, without noticing the eagerness of Daly&rsquo;s manner; &ldquo;the fellow
      seems to have had a taste for sporting matters which no personal fear
      could eradicate. His capture took place this wise. He went over to
      Doncaster, to be present at the Spring Meeting, where he betted freely,
      and won largely. There happened, however, to come a reverse to his
      fortune, and on the last day of the running he lost everything, and was
      obliged to apply for assistance to a former companion, who, it would seem,
      was some hundred pounds in his debt; this worthy, having no desire to
      refund, threatened the police; Freney became exasperated, knocked him down
      on the spot, and then, turning smartly round, chucked one of the jockeys
      from his saddle, sprang on the horse&rsquo;s back, and made off like lightning.
      The other, only stunned for a moment, was soon on his legs again, and the
      cry of &lsquo;Freney! it was Freney the robber!&rsquo; resounded throughout the
      race-course. The scene must then have been a most exciting one, for the
      whole mounted population, with one accord, gave chase. Noblemen and
      country gentlemen, fox-hunters, farmers, and blacklegs, away they went,
      Freney about a quarter of a mile in front, and riding splendidly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I &lsquo;m sure of,&rdquo; said Daly, earnestly. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mellington took the lead of every one, mounted on that great steeplechase
      horse he is so proud of,&mdash;no fences too large for him, they say; but
      the robber&mdash;and what a good judge of country the fellow must be&mdash;left
      the heavy ground and preferred even breasting a long hill of grass-land,
      with several high rails, to the open country below, where the clay soil
      distressed his horse. By this manoeuvre, says the newspaper, he was
      obliged to make a circuit which again brought the great body of his
      pursuers close up with him; and now his dexterity as a horseman became
      apparent, for while riding at top speed, and handling his horse with the
      most perfect judgment, he actually contrived to divest himself of his
      heavy greatcoat. He had but just accomplished this very difficult task,
      when Lord Mellington once more came up. There was a heavy dike in front,
      with a double post and rail, and at this they rushed desperately, each,
      apparently, calculating on the other being thrown, or at least checked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Freney, now only a dozen strides in advance, turned in his saddle, and
      drawing a pistol from his breast, took an aim,&mdash;as steadily, too, as
      if firing at a mark. Lord Mellington saw the dreadful purpose of the
      robber; he shouted aloud, and, pulling up with all his might, he bent down
      to the very mane of his horse. Freney pulled the trigger, and with one mad
      plunge Lord Mellington&rsquo;s horse came headforemost to the ground, with his
      rider under him. Freney was not long the victor; the racer he bestrode
      breasted the high rail, and, unable to clear it, fell heavily forward,
      smashing the frail timbers before him, and pitching the rider on his head.
      He was up in a second and away; for about twenty yards his speed was
      immense, then, reeling, he staggered forwards and fell senseless; before
      he rallied he was taken, and in handcuffs. There is a description of the
      fellow,&rdquo; said Lionel, &ldquo;and, by Jove! one would think they were describing
      some wild denizen of the woods, or some strange animal of savage life, so
      eloquent is the paragraph about his appearance and personal strength.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A well-knit fellow, no doubt, and more than a match for most in single
      combat,&rdquo; said Daly, musing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen him, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that I have, and must see him again. Where is he confined?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Newgate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so far fortunate, because the jailer is an old acquaintance of
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a great curiosity to see this Freney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along with me, then,&rdquo; said Daly, as he arose and rang the bell to
      order a carriage; &ldquo;you shall gratify your curiosity; but I must ask you to
      leave us alone together afterwards, for, strange as it may seem, we have a
      little affair of confidence between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It did, indeed, appear not a little strange that any secret negotiation or
      understanding should exist between two such men; but Lionel did not
      venture to ask any explanation of the difficulty, but silently prepared to
      accompany him. As they went along towards Newgate, Daly related several
      anecdotes of Freney, all of which tended to show that the fellow had all
      his life felt that strange passion for danger so attractive to certain
      minds, and that his lawless career was more probably adopted from this
      tendency than any mere desire of money-getting. Many of his robberies
      resembled feats of daring rather than cautious schemes to obtain property.
      &ldquo;Society,&rdquo; added Daly, &ldquo;is truly not much benefited because the highwayman
      is capricious; but still, one cannot divest oneself of a certain interest
      for a rascal who has always shown himself ready to risk his neck, and who
      has never been charged with any distinct act of cruelty. When I say this
      much, I must caution you against indulging a sympathy for a law-breaker
      because he is not a perfect monster of iniquity; such fellows are very
      rare, and we are always too well inclined to admire the few good qualities
      of a bad man, just as we are astonished at a few words spoken plain by a
      parrot.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;&lsquo;The things themselves are neither strange nor rare;
     We wonder how the devil they came there.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      While Daly wisely cautioned his young companion against the indulgence of
      a false and mawkish sympathy for the criminal, he in his own heart could
      not help feeling the strongest interest for any misfortune of a spirit so
      wild and so reckless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daly&rsquo;s card, passed through the iron grating of the strong door, soon
      procured them admission, and they were conducted into a small and neatly
      furnished room, where a mild-looking middle-aged man was seated, reading.
      He rose as they entered, and saluted them respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Dunn; I hope I see you well. My friend Captain Darcy&mdash;Mr.
      Dunn. We have just heard that the noted Freney has taken up his lodgings
      here, and are curious to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;m afraid I must refuse your request, Mr. Daly; my orders are most
      positive about the admission of any one to the prisoner: there have been I
      can&rsquo;t say how many people here on the same errand since four o&rsquo;clock, when
      he arrived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I ought to be free of the house,&rdquo; said Daly, laughing; &ldquo;I
      matriculated here at least, if I didn&rsquo;t take out a high degree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you did, sir,&rdquo; said Dunn, joining in the laugh. &ldquo;Freney is in the very
      same cell you occupied for four months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, then, you can&rsquo;t refuse me paying a visit to my old quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is another objection, and a stronger one,&mdash;. Freney himself
      declines seeing any one, and asked a special leave of the sheriff to
      refuse all comers admission to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This surprises me,&rdquo; said Daly. &ldquo;Why, the fellow has a prodigious deal of
      personal vanity, and I cannot conceive his having adopted such a
      resolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I can guess his meaning,&rdquo; said the jailer, shrewdly; &ldquo;the greater
      number of those who came here, and also who tried to see him in Liverpool,
      were artists of one kind or other, wanting to take busts or profiles of
      him. Now, my surmise is, Freney would not dislike the notoriety, if it
      were not that it might be inconvenient one of these days. To be plain,
      sir, though he is doubly ironed, and in the strongest part of the
      strongest jail in Ireland, he is at this moment meditating on an escape,
      in the event of which he calculates all the trouble and annoyance it would
      give him to have his picture or his cast stuck up in every town and
      village of the kingdom. This, at least, is my reading of the mystery; but
      I think it is not without some show of probability.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the objection could scarcely apply to me,&rdquo; said Daly; &ldquo;if his
      portrait be not taken by a more skilful artist than I am, he may be very
      easy on the score of recognition. Pray let me send in my name to him, and
      if he refuses to see me, I &lsquo;ll not press the matter further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Partly from an old feeling of kindness towards Daly, Dunn gave no further
      opposition, but in reality he was certain that Freney&rsquo;s refusal would set
      the matter at rest. His surprise was consequently great when the turnkey
      returned with a civil message from Freney that he would be very glad to
      see Mr. Daly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend can remain here,&rdquo; said Dunn, in a voice that plainly showed
      he was not quite easy in his mind as to the propriety of the interview;
      and Daly, to alleviate suspicions natural enough in one so circumstanced,
      assented, and walked on after the turnkey, alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way he spends his time; listen to him now,&rdquo; whispered the
      turnkey, as they stopped at the door of the cell, from within which the
      deep tones of a man&rsquo;s voice were heard singing to himself, as he slowly
      paced the narrow chamber, his heavy fetters keeping a melancholy time to
      the melody:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;&lsquo;T was afther two when he quitted Naas,
     But he gave the spar, and he went the pace,
     &lsquo;As many an like may now give chase,&rsquo;
     Says he, &lsquo;I give you warning.
     You may raise the country far and near,
     From Malin Head down to Cape Clear,
     But the divil a man of ye all I fear,
     I &lsquo;ll be far away before morning.&rsquo;

     &ldquo;By break of day he reach&rsquo;d Kildare,
     The black horse never turn&rsquo;d a hair;
     Says Freney, &lsquo;We &lsquo;ve some time to spare,
     This stage we &lsquo;ve rather hasten&rsquo;d.&rsquo;
     So he eat four eggs and a penny rowl,
     And he mix&rsquo;d of whiskey such a bowl!
     The drink he shared with the beast, by my sowl,
     For Jack was always dacent.

     &ldquo;&lsquo;You might tighten the girths,&rsquo; Jack Freney cried,
     &lsquo;For I &lsquo;ve soon a heavy road to ride.&rsquo;
     &lsquo;Twas the truth he tould, for he never lied;
     The way was dark and rainy.
     &lsquo;Good-by,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I &lsquo;ll soon be far,
     And many a mile from Mullingar.&rsquo;
     So he kiss&rsquo;d the girl behind the bar,
     &lsquo;T is the divil you wor, Jack Freney!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorra lie in that, any way,&rdquo; said the robber, as he repeated the last
      line over once more, with evident self-satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who comes there?&rdquo; cried he, sternly, as the heavy bolts were shot back,
      and the massive door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you say, &lsquo;Stand and deliver&rsquo;?&rdquo; said the turnkey, with a laugh
      as harsh and grating as the creak of the rusty hinges.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And many a time I did to a better man,&rdquo; said Freney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may leave us now,&rdquo; said Daly, to the turnkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Daly, your sarvant,&rdquo; said the robber, saluting him; &ldquo;you &lsquo;re the only
      man in Ireland I wanted to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish our meeting had been anywhere else,&rdquo; said Daly, sorrowfully, as he
      took his seat on a stool opposite the bed where Freney sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, so it is, sir; it&rsquo;s just what every one prophesied this many
      a day,&mdash;as if there was much cunning in saying that I &lsquo;d be hanged
      some time or other; why, if they wanted to surprise me, they &lsquo;d have tould
      me I &lsquo;d never be taken. You heard how it was, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daly nodded, and Freney went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The English horse wouldn&rsquo;t rise to the rail; if I was on the chestnut
      mare or Black Billy, I would n&rsquo;t be where I am now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have several things to ask you about, Freney; but first, how I can
      serve you? You must have counsel in this business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I thank you; it&rsquo;s only throwing good money after bad. I&rsquo;ll plead
      guilty,&mdash;it will save time with us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you give yourself no chance, man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faix, I spoiled my chance long ago, Mr. Daly. Do you know, sir,&rdquo;&mdash;here
      he spoke in a low, determined tone,&mdash;&ldquo;there&rsquo;s not a mail in Ireland I
      did n&rsquo;t stop at one time or other. There&rsquo;s few country gentlemen I have
      n&rsquo;t lightened of their guineas; the court wouldn&rsquo;t hold the witnesses
      against me if I were to stand my trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all that, you must still employ a lawyer; these fellows are as
      crafty in <i>their</i> walk as ever you were in <i>yours</i>. Who will you
      have? Name the man, and leave the rest to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Freney seemed to deliberate for a few moments, and he threw his eyes down
      at the heavy irons on his legs, and he gazed at the strong stanchions of
      the windows, and then said, in a low voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a chap called Hosey M&rsquo;Garry, in a cellar in Charles Street: he&rsquo;s
      an ould man with one eye, and not a tooth in his head; but he&rsquo;s the only
      man that could sarve me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hosey M&rsquo;Garry,&rdquo; repeated Daly, &ldquo;Charles Street,&rdquo; as he wrote down the
      address with his pencil: &ldquo;a strange name and residence for a lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t say he was, sir,&rdquo; said Freney, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who and what is he, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only man, now alive, that can make a cowld chisel to cut iron without
      noise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0016" id="linkimage-0016">

      <img src="images/440.jpg" width="100%" alt="440 " />
    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re thinking of; you&rsquo;d rather trust to the flaws of
      the iron than of the indictment. Perhaps you are not far wrong, after
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I was in the court below without the fetters,&rdquo; said Freney, eagerly,
      &ldquo;I could climb the wall with a holdfast and a chisel, and get down the
      same way on the other side; once there, Mr. Daly, I &lsquo;d sing the ould
      ballad,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;For the divil a man of ye all I fear,
     I &lsquo;ll be far away before morning.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how are these tools to reach you here? If they admit any of your
      friends, won&rsquo;t they search them first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they will, barrin&rsquo; it was a gentleman,&rdquo; replied Freney, while his eyes
      twinkled with a peculiarly cunning lustre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, then, you rely on <i>me</i> for this piece of service?&rdquo; said Daly,
      after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Troth, you&rsquo;re the only gentleman of my acquaintance,&rdquo; said Freney,
      quaintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose I must not give you a bad impression of the order; I &lsquo;ll
      do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would,&rdquo; rejoined Freney, calmly. &ldquo;You might bring two files at
      the same time, and a phial of sweet oil to keep down the noise. Hush!
      here&rsquo;s Gavin coming to turn you out,&mdash;he said ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you shall see me to-morrow, Freney, and I &lsquo;ll endeavor to see
      your friend in the mean time.&rdquo; This was said as the turnkey stood at the
      open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This gentleman wants to have a look at you, Freney,&rdquo; said the jailer,&mdash;&ldquo;as
      if he could n&rsquo;t see you for nothing, some Saturday morning soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe he &lsquo;d not know me in a nightcap,&rdquo; replied Freney, laughing, while
      he turned the lamplight full on Lionel Darcy&rsquo;s features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very fellow that rode off with the horse!&rdquo; exclaimed Lionel as he saw
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young O&rsquo;Reilly!&rdquo; said Freney. &ldquo;What signifies that charge now? Won&rsquo;t it
      satisfy you if they hang me for something else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Captain Darcy, man,&rdquo; broke in Daly. &ldquo;Is all your knowledge of
      mankind of so little use to you that you cannot distinguish between a born
      gentleman and an upstart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my oath,&rdquo; said the robber, aloud, &ldquo;I &lsquo;m as glad as a ten-pound note to
      know that it wasn&rsquo;t a half-bred one that showed the spirit you did!
      Hurrah! there&rsquo;s hopes for ould Ireland yet, when the blood and bone is
      still left in her! And wasn&rsquo;t it real luck that I saw you this night? If I
      did n&rsquo;t, I &lsquo;d have done you a bad turn. One word, Mr. Daly, one word in
      your ear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The robber drew Daly towards him, and whispered eagerly for some seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      A violent exclamation burst from Daly as he listened, and then he cried
      out, &ldquo;What! are you sure of this? Don&rsquo;t deceive me, man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I never, but it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, not have told it before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&rdquo;&mdash;here he faltered&mdash;&ldquo;because&mdash;faix, I &lsquo;ll tell the
      truth&mdash;I thought that young gentleman was Hickman&rsquo;s grandson, and I
      could n&rsquo;t bring myself to do him a spite after what I had seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time is up, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the turnkey, who, out of the delicacy of
      his official feeling, was slowly pacing the corridor up and down while
      they talked together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this be but true,&rdquo; muttered Daly to himself, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s another cast of
      the dice for it yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for that fellow,&rdquo; said Lionel, aloud; &ldquo;he did me a good turn
      once: I might have gone down the torrent, were it not for his aid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you might, man,&rdquo; said Daly, speaking in a half-soliloquy; &ldquo;he gives
      the only chance of victory I&rsquo;ve seen yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words, so evidently inapplicable to Lionel&rsquo;s observations, were a
      perfect enigma; but he did not dare to ask for any explanation, and walked
      on in silence beside him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII. A SCENE OF HOME.
    </h2>
    <p>
      If the climate of northern Ireland be habitually one of storm and
      severity, it must be confessed that, in the rare but happy intervals of
      better weather, the beauty of the coast scenery is unsurpassed. Indented
      with little bays, whose sides are formed of immense cliffs of chalk, or
      the more stately grandeur of that columnar basalt which extends for miles
      on either side of the Causeway, the most vivid coloring unites with forms
      the wildest and most fantastic; crag and precipice, sandy beach and rocky
      shore, alternate in endless variety; while islands are there, some, green
      and sheep-clad, others, dark and frowning, form the home of nothing but
      the sea-gull.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on such an evening of calm as displayed the scene to its greatest
      advantage, when a long column of burnished golden light floated over the
      sea, tipping each crested wave, and darkened into deeper beauty between
      them, that the Knight, Lady Eleanor, and Helen sat under the little porch
      of their cottage and gazed upon the fair and gorgeous picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the leafy grove or the dark wood seem sweeter to our senses when the
      thrilling notes of the blackbird or the thrush sing in their solitude, so
      the deepest silence, the most unbroken stillness, has a wonderful effect
      of soothing to the mind beside the seashore we have so often seen terrible
      in the fury of the storm. A gentle calm steals over us as we listen to the
      long sweeping of the waves, heaving and breaking in measured melody; and
      our thoughts, enticed by some dreaming ecstasy, wander away over the
      boundless ocean, not to the far-off lands of other climes alone, but into
      worlds of brighter and more beauteous mould.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat in silence, at first only occupied by the lovely scene that
      stretched away before them, but at last each deeply immersed in his own
      thoughts,&mdash;thoughts which, unconnected with the objects around, yet
      by some strange mystery were tinctured by all their calm and tranquil
      beauty. A fisherman was mending his net upon the little beach below, and
      his children were playing around him, now running merrily along the
      strand, now dabbling in the white foam left by the retreating waves; the
      father looked up from time to time to watch them, but without interrupting
      the low monotonous chant by which he lightened his labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the little group at length their eyes were turned. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the
      Knight, as if interpreting what was passing in the minds of those at his
      side, &ldquo;that is about as near to human happiness as life affords. I believe
      there would be very few abortive ambitions if men were content to see
      their children occupy the same station as themselves; and yet, when the
      time of one&rsquo;s own reverses arrives, how very little of true happiness is
      lost by the change of fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest father!&rdquo; said Helen, as in a transport of delight she threw
      her arms around him, &ldquo;how happy your words make me! You are, then,
      contented?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I not look so, my sweet Helen? And your mother, too, when have you
      seen her so well?&mdash;when do you remember her walking, as she did
      to-day, to the top of the great cliff of Dunluce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With no other ill consequence,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, smiling, &ldquo;than a most
      acute attack of vanity; for I begin to fancy myself quite young again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mamma, don&rsquo;t forget we have a visit to pay, some of these days, to
      Ballintray,&mdash;that&rsquo;s the name of the place, I think, Miss Daly resides
      at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we really must not neglect it. There was a delicacy in her note of
      welcome to us here, judging that we might not be prepared for a personal
      visit, which prepossesses me in her favor. You promised to make our
      acknowledgments, but I believe you forgot all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not that,&rdquo; said the Knight, hesitatingly; &ldquo;but in the midst of so
      many things to do and think about, I deferred it from day to day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go to-morrow, then?&rdquo; cried Helen, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it were better if your father went first, lest the way should
      prove too long for us. I am so proud of my pedestrianism, Helen, I&rsquo;ll not
      risk any failure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said the Knight, quietly. &ldquo;And now of this other matter
      Bagenal presses so strongly upon us. I feel the greatest repugnance to
      assume any name but that I have always borne, and, I hope, not disgraced;
      he says we shall be objects of impertinent curiosity here to the
      neighborhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruins to dispute the honors of lionship with Dunluce,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor,
      smiling faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so; that might, however, be borne patiently; they will soon leave
      off talking of us when we give them little matter for speculative gossip.
      Besides, we are so far away from anything that could be called
      neighborhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he suggests some other reasons, if I mistake not,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does, but so darkly and mysteriously that I cannot even guess his
      drift. Here is his letter.&rdquo; And the Knight took several papers from his
      pocket, from among which he selected one, whose large and blotted writing
      unmistakably pronounced it Bagenal Daly&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Yes, here it is: &lsquo;Bicknell
      says that Hickman&rsquo;s people are fully persuaded that you have left Ireland
      with the intention of never returning; that this impression should be
      maintained, because it will induce them to be less guarded than if they
      believed you were still here, directing any legal proceeding. The only
      case, therefore, he will prepare for trial will be one respecting the
      leases falsely signed. The bond and its details must be unravelled by
      time; here also your incognito is all-essential,&mdash;it need only be for
      a short time, and on scruples of delicacy so easily got over: your
      grandfather called himself Gwynne, and wrote it also.&rsquo; That is quite true,
      Eleanor, so he did; his letters are signed Matthew Gwynne, Knight of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
      I remember the signature well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, with Mr. Daly,&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, &ldquo;it will save us a world of
      observant impertinence; this place is tranquil and solitary enough just
      now, but in summer the coast and the Causeway have many visitors, and
      although &lsquo;the Corvy&rsquo; is out of the common track, if our names be bruited
      about, we shall not escape that least graceful of all attentions, the
      tender commiseration of mere acquaintances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma is right,&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;we should be hunted out by every tourist to
      report on how we bore our reverses, and tormented with anonymous
      condolences in prose, and short stanzas on the beauty of resignation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and, my dear Helen, perhaps the lessons might not be so very
      inapplicable,&rdquo; said the Knight, smiling affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But very inefficient, sir,&rdquo; replied Helen, with a toss of her head; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      not a bit resigned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, dearest,&rdquo; interposed Lady Eleanor, rebukingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit, Mamma; I am happy,&mdash;happier than I ever knew myself
      before, if you like that phrase better,&mdash;because we are together,
      because this life realizes to me all I ever dreamed of,&mdash;that quiet
      and tranquil pleasure people might, but somehow never please to, taste of;
      but if you ask me am I resigned to see you and my dear father in a station
      so much beneath your expectations and your habits, I cannot say that I
      am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my dear girl, you accuse us of bearing our misfortunes badly, if we
      cannot partake of your enjoyments on account of our own vain regrets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Papa, don&rsquo;t mistake me; if I grieve over the altered fortunes
      that limit your sphere of usefulness as well as of pleasure, it is because
      I know how well you understood the privileges and demands of your high
      station, and how little a life so humble as this is can exact of qualities
      that were not given to be wasted in obscurity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sweet child,&rdquo; said the Knight, fondly, &ldquo;it is a very dangerous
      practice to blend up affection with principle; depend upon it, the former
      will always coerce the latter, and bend it to its will; and as for those
      good gifts you speak of, had I really as many of them as your fond heart
      would endow me with, believe me there is no station so humble as not to
      admit of their exercise. There never yet was a walk in life without its
      sphere of duties; now I intend that not only are we to be happy here, but
      that we should contribute to the well-being of those about us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause after the Knight had done speaking, during which he
      busied himself in turning over some letters, the seals of which were still
      unbroken; he knew the handwriting on most of them, and yet hesitated about
      inflicting on himself the pain of reading allusions to that condition he
      had once occupied. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; muttered he to himself, &ldquo;we are always
      flattering ourselves of how essential we are to our friends, our party,
      and so forth; and yet, when any events occur which despoil us of our brief
      importance, we see the whole business of the world go on as currently as
      ever. What a foretaste this gives one of death! So it is, the stream of
      life flows on, whether the bubble on its surface float or burst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Lord Netherby&rsquo;s hand, is it not?&rdquo; said Lady Eleanor, as she lifted
      a letter which had fallen to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Darcy, carelessly; &ldquo;written probably soon after his return to
      England. I have no doubt it contains a most courtly acknowledgment of our
      poor hospitality, and an assurance of undying regard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it be of that tenor, I have no curiosity to read it,&rdquo; said Lady
      Eleanor, handing the letter to the Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen would like to study so great a master of epistolary flatteries,&rdquo;
       said the Knight, smiling; &ldquo;and provided she will keep the whole for her
      private reading, I am willing to indulge her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept the favor with thanks,&rdquo; said Helen, receiving the letter; &ldquo;you
      know I plead guilty to liking our noble relative. I &lsquo;m not skilled enough
      to distinguish between an article trebly gilded and one of pure gold, and
      his Lordship, to my eyes, looked as like the true metal as possible: he
      said so many pretty things to Mamma, and so many fine things of you and
      Lionel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And paid so many compliments to the fair Helen herself,&rdquo; interposed the
      Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With so much of good tact&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And good taste, Helen,&rdquo; added Lady Eleanor, smiling; &ldquo;why not say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I see I shall have to defend myself as well as my champion, so I
      &lsquo;ll even go and read my letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so saying, she arose, and sauntered down to the shore; under the
      shelter of a tall rock, from whence the view extended for miles along, she
      sat down. &ldquo;What a contrast!&rdquo; said she, as she broke the seal, &ldquo;a
      courtier&rsquo;s letter in such a scene as this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Netherby&rsquo;s letter was, as the Knight suspected, written soon after
      his return to England, expressing, in his own most courtly phrase, the
      delightful memory he retained of his visit to Ireland. Gracefully
      contrasting the brilliant excitement of that brief period with the more
      staid quietude of the life to which he returned, he lightly suggested that
      none other than one native to the soil could support an existence so
      overflowing with pleasurable emotions. With all the artifice of a
      courtier, he recalled certain little incidents, too small, as mere matters
      of memory, to find a resting-place in the mind, but all of them indicative
      of the deep impression made, upon him who remarked them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke also of the delight with which his Royal Highness the Prince
      listened to his narrative of life in Ireland. &ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; wrote his
      Lordship, &ldquo;I do not believe that the exigencies of his station ever cost
      him more than when he reflected on the impossibility of his witnessing
      such perfection in the life of a country house as I feebly endeavored to
      convey to him. Again and again has he asked me to repeat the tale of the
      hunt&mdash;the brilliant ball the night of your arrival&mdash;and I have
      earned a character for story-telling of which Kelly and Sheridan are
      beginning to feel jealous, by the mere retail of your anecdotes. Lionel&rsquo;s
      return is anxiously looked for by all here, and the Prince has more than
      once expressed himself impatient to see him back again. My sweet favorite
      Helen, too,&mdash;when is she to be presented? There will be a court in
      the early part of next month, of which I shall not fail to apprise you,
      most earnestly entreating that my cousin Eleanor will not think the
      journey too far which shall bring her once again among those scenes she so
      gracefully adorned, and where her triumphs will be renewed in the
      admiration of her lovely daughter. I need not tell you that my house in
      town is entirely at her disposal, either as <i>my</i> guests, or, if you
      prefer it, I shall be <i>theirs</i>, whenever I am not in waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the writer detailed, with an eloquence all his own, the advantage to
      Helen of making her <i>entrée</i> into life under circumstances so
      favorable, remarking, with that conventional philosophy just then the
      popular cant of the day, that the enthusiasm of the world was never
      long-lived, and that even his beautiful cousin Helen should not be above
      profiting by the favorable reception the kindly disposition of the court
      was sure to procure for her. This was said in a tone of half-serious
      banter, but at the same time the invitation was reiterated with an evident
      desire for its acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the letter drew near its conclusion, the lines became more closely
      written, as though some circumstances hitherto forgotten had suddenly
      occurred to the writer; and so it proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was about, my dear Knight, to write myself, with what truth I will not
      say, your &lsquo;most affectionate friend, Netherby,&rsquo; when I received a letter
      which requires some mention at my hands. It is, indeed, one of the most
      extraordinary documents I have ever perused; nothing very wonderful in
      that, when I tell you from whom it comes,&mdash;your old sweetheart, Julia
      Wallincourt, or, as you will better remember her, Julia d&rsquo;Esterre; she is
      still very beautiful, and just as capricious, just as <i>maligne</i>, as
      when she endeavored, by every artifice of her coquetry, to make you jilt
      my cousin Eleanor. There &lsquo;s no doubt of it, Darcy, this woman loved you!
      at least, as much as she could love anything, except the pleasure of
      torturing her fellow-creatures. Well, it would seem that a younger son of
      hers, popularly known as Dick Forester, paid you a visit in Ireland, and,
      no very unnatural occurrence, fell desperately in love with your daughter,&mdash;not
      so Helen with him. She probably regarded him as one of that class upon
      which London has so stamped its impress of habit and manner that all
      individualism is lost in the quiet observance of certain proprieties. He
      must have been a rare contrast to the high-souled enthusiasm and
      waywardness of her own brother! Certain it is she refused him; and he,
      taking the thing much more to heart than a young Guardsman usually does a
      similar catastrophe, hastened home, and endeavored to interest his mother
      in his suit. Lady Julia had an old vengeance to exact, and, like a true
      woman, could not forego it; she not only positively refused all
      intercession on her part, but went what you and I will probably feel to be
      a very unnecessary length, and actually declared she never would consent
      to such an alliance. We used to remember (some years ago), at Eton, of a
      certain Dido who never forgave, and we are told how, for many years after,
      the <i>lethalis arundo lateri adhosit</i>; but assuredly the poet was
      speaking less of the woes of an individual than of the sorrows of fine
      ladies in all ages. Unfortunately, the similitude between her ladyship and
      Dido ends here; the classic fair one exhibited, as we are told, the most
      delicate fondness for the son of her lover. But, to grow serious, Lady
      Wallincourt&rsquo;s conduct must have been peremptory and harsh; she actually
      went the length of writing to the Duke of York to request an exchange for
      her son into a regiment serving in India: whether Forester obtained some
      clew to this manouvre or not, he anticipated the stroke by selling out and
      leaving the army altogether; whither he is gone, or what has become of him
      since, no one can tell. Such, my dear Knight, is the emergency in which
      Lady Wallincourt addresses her letter to me,&mdash;a letter so peculiarly
      her own, so full of reproaches against you, and vindication of herself,
      that I actually scruple to transmit to you this palpable evidence of still
      enduring affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you both thirty years younger, I should claim great credit to my
      morality for the forbearance. Let that pass, however, and let me rather
      ask you if you know, or have heard anything, of this wayward boy?
      Personally, I am unacquainted with him; but his friends agree in saying
      that he is high-spirited, honorable, and brave; and it would be a great
      pity that his affection for a young lady, and his anger with an old one,
      should mar all the prospects of his life. Could you, by any means, find a
      clew to him? I do not, of course, ask you to interfere in person, lest it
      might seem that you encouraged an attachment which you have far more
      reason to discountenance for your daughter than has Lady Wallincourt for
      her son; however, your doing so would go far to reconcile the young man to
      his mother by showing that, if there was a difficulty on one side, a still
      greater obstacle existed on the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Requesting a speedy answer, and begging that the whole might be in strict
      confidence between them, the letter concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not doubt, my dear Knight,&rdquo; said the postscript, &ldquo;that you will see
      in all this a reason the more for coming up to town. Helen&rsquo;s appearance at
      the Drawing-Room would be the best, if not the only, rebuke Lady
      Wallin-court&rsquo;s insolence could receive. By all means, come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another complication! Lady W., on first hearing of her son&rsquo;s duel, and
      the kind treatment he met with after being wounded, wrote a letter of
      grateful acknowledgments, which she enclosed to her son, neither knowing
      nor caring for the address of his benefactor. When she did hear it at
      length, she was excessively angry that she had been, as she terms it, &lsquo;the
      first to make advances.&rsquo; Ainsi, telles sont les femmes du monde!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was Lord Netherby&rsquo;s letter. With what a succession of emotions Helen
      read it we confess ourselves unable to depict. If she sometimes hesitated
      to read on, an influence, too powerful to control, impelled her to
      continue, while a secret interest in Forester&rsquo;s fortunes&mdash;a feeling
      she had never known till now&mdash;induced her to learn his fate. More
      than once, in the alteration of her condition, had she recalled the
      proffer of affection she had with such determination rejected, and with
      what gratitude did she remember the firmness of her decision!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;I deemed it the mere caprice of one whose
      gratitude for kindness had outrun his calmer convictions. And so he really
      loved me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We must avow the fact: Helen&rsquo;s indifference to Forester had, in the main,
      proceeded from a false estimate of his character; she saw in him nothing
      but a well-bred, good-looking youth, who, with high connections and
      moderate abilities, had formed certain ambitious views, to be realized
      rather by the adventitious aid of fortune than his own merits. He was, in
      her eyes, a young politician, cautions and watchful, trained up to regard
      Lord Castlereagh as the model of statesmen, and political intrigue as the
      very climax of intellectual display. To know that she had wronged him was
      to make a great revolution in her feelings towards him, to see that this
      reserved and calmly minded youth should have sacrificed everything&mdash;position,
      prospects, all&mdash;rather than resign his hope, faint as it was, of one
      day winning her affection!
    </p>
    <p>
      If these were her first thoughts on reading that letter, those that
      followed were far less pleasurable. How should she ever be able to show it
      to her father? The circumstances alluded to were of a nature he never
      could be cognizant of without causing the greatest pain both to him and
      herself. To ask Lady Eleanor&rsquo;s counsel would be even more difficult. Helen
      witnessed the emotion the sight of Lady Wallincourt&rsquo;s name had occasioned
      her mother the day Forester first visited them; the old rivalry had, then,
      left its trace on her mind as well as on that of Lady Julia! What
      embarrassment on every hand! Where could she seek counsel, and in whom?
      Bagenal Daly, the only one she could have opened her heart to, was away;
      and was it quite certain she would have ventured to disclose, even to him,
      the story of that affection which already appeared so different from at
      first? Forester was not now in her eyes the fashionable guardsman,
      indulging a passing predilection, or whiling away the tedious hours of a
      country-house by a flirtation, in which he felt interested because
      repulsed; he was elevated in her esteem by his misfortunes, and the very
      uncertainty of his fate augmented her concern. And yet she must forego the
      hope of saving him, or else, by showing the letter to her father,
      acknowledge her acquaintance with events she should never have known, or,
      knowing, should never reveal.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no help for it, the letter could not be shown. In all likelihood
      neither the Knight nor Lady Eleanor would ever think more about it; and if
      they did, there was still enough to speak of in the courteous sentiments
      of the writer, and the polite attention of his invitation,&mdash;a
      civility which even Helen&rsquo;s knowledge of life informed her was rather
      proffered in discharge of a debt than as emanating from any real desire to
      play their host in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus satisfying herself that no better course offered for the present, she
      turned homewards, but with a heavier heart and more troubled mind than had
      ever been her fortune in life to have suffered.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
