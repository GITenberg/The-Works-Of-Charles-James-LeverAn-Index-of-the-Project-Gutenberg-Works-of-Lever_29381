<h2>
TO MY CHILDREN
</h2>
<h3>
MY DEAR CHILDREN,
</h3>
<p>
There are few things less likely than that it will ever be your lot to
exercise any of the rights or privileges of landed property. It may
chance, however, that even in your humble sphere, there may be those who
shall look up to you for support, and be, in some wise, dependent on your
will; if so, pray let this little story have its lesson in your hearts,
think, that when I wrote it, I desired to inculcate the truth, that
prosperity has as many duties as adversity has sorrows; that those to whom
Providence has accorded many blessings are but the stewards of His bounty
to the poor; and that the neglect of an obligation so sacred as this
charity is a grievous wrong, and may be the origin of evils for which all
your efforts to do good through life will be but a poor atonement.
</p>
<p>
Your affectionate Father,
</p>
<p>
CHARLES LEVER.

<h2>
FIRST ERA.
</h2>
<p>
IT was on the 16th of March, the eve of St. Patrick, not quite twenty
years ago, that a little village on the bank of Lough Corrib was
celebrating in its annual fair &ldquo;the holy times,&rdquo; devoting one day to every
species of enjoyment and pleasure, and on the next, by practising prayers
and penance of various kinds, as it were to prepare their minds to resume
their worldly duties in a frame of thought more seemly and becoming.
</p>
<p>
If a great and wealthy man might smile at the humble preparations for
pleasure displayed on this occasion, he could scarcely scoff at the scene
which surrounded them. The wide valley, encircled by lofty mountains,
whose swelling outlines were tracked against the blue sky, or mingled
gracefully with clouds, whose forms were little less fantastic and wild.
The broad lake, stretching away into the distance, and either lost among
the mountain-passes, or contracting as it approached the ancient city of
Galway: a few, and but very few, islands marked its surface, and these
rugged and rocky; on one alone a human trace was seen-the ruins of an
ancient church; it was a mere gable now, but you could still track out the
humble limits it had occupied-scarce space sufficient for twenty persons:
such were once, doubtless, the full number of converts to the faith who
frequented there. There was a wild and savage grandeur in the whole: the
very aspect of the mountains proclaimed desolation, and seemed to frown
defiance at the efforts of man to subdue them to his use; and even the
herds of wild cattle seemed to stray with caution among the cliffs and
precipices of this dreary region. Lower down, however, and as if in
compensation of the infertile tract above, the valley was marked by
patches of tillage and grass-land, and studded with cottages; which, if
presenting at a nearer inspection indubitable signs of poverty, yet to the
distant eye bespoke something of rural comfort, nestling as they often did
beneath some large rock, and sheltered by the great turf-stack, which even
the poorest possessed. Many streams wound their course through this
valley; along whose borders, amid a pasture brighter than the emerald, the
cattle grazed, and there, from time to time some peasant child sat fishing
as he watched the herd.
</p>
<p>
Shut in by lake and mountain, this seemed a little spot apart from all the
world; and so, indeed, its inhabitants found it. They were a poor but not
unhappy race of people, whose humble lives had taught them nothing of the
comforts and pleasures of richer communities. Poverty had, from habit, no
terrors for them; short of actual want, they never felt its pressure
heavily.
</p>
<p>
Such were they who now were assembled to celebrate the festival of their
Patron Saint. It was drawing towards evening; the sun was already low, and
the red glare that shone from behind the mountains shewed that he was Bear
his setting. The business of the fair was almost concluded; the little
traffic so remote a region could supply, the barter of a few sheep, the
sale of a heifer, a mountain pony, or a flock of goats, had all passed
off; and now the pleasures of the occasion were about to succeed. The
votaries to amusement, as if annoyed at the protracted dealings of the
more worldly minded, were somewhat rudely driving away the cattle that
still continued to linger about; and pigs and poultry were beginning to
discover that they were merely intruders. The canvass booths, erected as
shelter against the night-air, were becoming crowded with visitors; and
from more than one of the number the pleasant sounds of the bagpipe might
now be heard, accompanied by the dull shuffling tramp of heavily-shod
feet.
</p>

</div>
<p>
Various shows and exhibitions were also in preparation, and singular
announcements were made by gentlemen in a mingled costume of Turk and
Thimble-rigger, of &ldquo;wonderful calves with two heads;&rdquo; &ldquo;six-legged pigs;&rdquo;
 and an &ldquo;infant of two years old that could drink a quart of spirits at a
draught, if a respectable company were assembled to witness it;&rdquo;&mdash;a feat
which, for the honour of young Ireland, it should be added, was ever
postponed from a deficiency in the annexed condition.
</p>
<p>
Then there were &ldquo;restaurants&rdquo; on a scale of the most primitive simplicity,
where boiled beef or &ldquo;spoleen&rdquo; was sold from a huge pot, suspended over a
fire in the open air, and which was invariably surrounded by a gourmand
party of both sexes; gingerbread and cakes of every fashion and every
degree of indigestion also abounded; while jugs and kegs flanked the
entrance to each tent, reeking with a most unmistakable odour of that
prime promoter of native drollery and fun&mdash;poteen. All was stir,
movement, and bustle; old friends, separated since the last occasion of a
similar festivity, were embracing cordially, the men kissing with an
affectionate warmth no German ever equalled; pledges of love and
friendship were taken in brimming glasses by many, who were perhaps to
renew the opportunity for such testimonies hereafter, by a fight that very
evening; contracts, ratified by whisky, until that moment not deemed
binding; and courtships, prosecuted with hopes, which the whole year
previous had never suggested; kind speeches and words of welcome went
round; while here and there some closely-gathered heads and scowling
glances gave token, that other scores were to be acquitted on that night
than merely those of commerce; and in the firmly knitted brow, and more
firmly grasped blackthorn, a practised observer could foresee, that some
heads were to carry away deeper marks of that meeting, than simple memory
can impress;&mdash;and thus, in this wild sequestered spot, human passions
were as rife as in the most busy communities of pampered civilisation.
Love, hate, and hope, charity, fear, forgiveness, and malice;
long-smouldering revenge, long&mdash;subdued affection; hearts pining
beneath daily drudgery, suddenly awakened to a burst of pleasure and a
renewal of happiness in the sight of old friends, for many a day lost
sight of; words of good cheer; half mutterings of menace; the whispered
syllables of love; the deeply-uttered tones of vengeance; and amid all,
the careless reckless glee of those, who appeared to feel the hour one
snatched from the grasp of misery, and devoted to the very abandonment of
pleasure. It seemed in vain that want and poverty had shed their chilling
influence over hearts like these. The snow-drift and the storm might
penetrate their frail dwellings; the winter might blast, the hurricane
might scatter their humble hoardings; but still, the bold high-beating
spirit that lived within, beamed on throughout every trial; and now, in
the hour of long-sought enjoyment, blazed forth in a flame of joy, that
was all but frantic.
</p>
<p>
The step that but yesterday fell wearily upon the ground, now smote the
earth with a proud beat, that told of manhood&rsquo;s daring; the voices were
high, the eyes were flashing; long pent-up emotions of every shade and
complexion were there; and it seemed a season where none should wear
disguise, but stand forth in all the fearlessness of avowed resolve; and
in the heart-home looks of love, as well as in the fiery glances of
hatred, none practised concealment. Here, went one with his arm round his
sweetheart&rsquo;s waist,&mdash;an evidence of accepted affection none dared
even to stare at; there, went another, the skirt of his long loose coat
thrown over his arm, in whose hand a stick was brandished&mdash;his
gesture, even without his wild hurroo! an open declaration of battle, a
challenge to all who liked it. Mothers were met in close conclave,
interchanging family secrets and cares; and daughters, half conscious of
the parts they themselves were playing in the converse, passed looks of
sly intelligence to each other. And beggars were there too&mdash;beggars
of a class which even the eastern Dervish can scarcely vie with: cripples
brought many a mile away from their mountain-homes to extort charity by
exhibitions of dreadful deformity; the halt, the blind, the muttering
idiot, the moping melanc holy mad, mixed up with strange and motley
figures in patched uniforms and rags&mdash;some, amusing the crowd by
their drolleries, some, singing a popular ballad of the time&mdash;while
through all, at every turn and every corner, one huge fellow, without
legs, rode upon an ass, his wide chest ornamented by a picture of himself,
and a paragraph setting forth his infirmities. He, with a voice deeper
than a bassoon, bellowed forth his prayer for alms, and seemed to
monopolise far more than his proportion of charity, doubtless owing to the
more artistic development to which he had brought his profession.

</div>
<p>
&ldquo;De prayers of de holy Joseph be an yez, and relieve de maimed; de prayers
and blessins of all de Saints on dem that assists de suffering!&rdquo; And there
were pilgrims, some with heads venerable enough for the canvass of an old
master, with flowing beards, and relics hung round their necks, objects of
worship which failed not to create sentiments of devotion in the
passers-by. But among these many sights and sounds, each calculated to
appeal to different classes and ages of the motley mass, one object
appeared to engross a more than ordinary share of attention; and although
certainly not of a nature to draw marked notice elsewhere, was here
sufficiently strange and uncommon to become actually a spectacle. This was
neither more nor less than an English groom, who, mounted upon a
thorough-bred horse, led another by the bridle, and slowly paraded
backwards and forwards, in attendance on his master.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Them&rsquo;s the iligant bastes, Darby,&rdquo; said one of the bystanders, as the
horses moved past. &ldquo;A finer pair than that I never seen.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re beauties, and no denying it,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;and they&rsquo;ve skins
like a looking-glass.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Arrah, botheration t&rsquo; yez! what are ye saying about their skins?&rdquo; cried a
third, whose dress and manner betokened one of the jank of a small farmer.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis the breeding that&rsquo;s in &lsquo;em; that&rsquo;s the raal beauty. Only look at
their pasterns; and see how fine they run off over the quarter.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Which is the best now, Phil?&rdquo; said another, addressing the last speaker
with a tone of some deference.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The grey horse is worth two of the dark chesnut,&rdquo; replied Phil
oracularly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is he, then!&rdquo; cried two or three in a breath. &ldquo;Why is that, Phil?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you perceive the signs of blood about the ears? They&rsquo;re long, and
coming to a point&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong this time, my friend,&rdquo; said a sharp voice, with an accent
which in Ireland would be called English. &ldquo;You may be an excellent judge
of an ass, but the horse you speak of, as the best, is not worth a fourth
part of the value of the other.&rdquo; And so saying, a young and handsome man,
attired in a riding costume, brushed somewhat rudely through the crowd,
and seizing the rein of the led horse, vaulted lightly into the saddle and
rode off, leaving Phil to the mockery and laughter of the crowd, whose
reverence for the opinion of a gentleman was only beneath that they
accorded to the priest himself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faix, ye got it there, Phil!&rdquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis down on ye he was that time!&rdquo; &ldquo;Musha,
but ye may well get red in the face!&rdquo; Such and such-like were the comments
on one who but a moment before was rather a popular candidate for public
honours.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who is he, then, at all?&rdquo; said one among the rest, and who had come up
too late to witness the scene.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis the young Mr. Leslie, the landlord&rsquo;s son, that&rsquo;s come over to fish
the lakes,&rdquo; replied an old man reverentially.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Begorra, he&rsquo;s no landlord of mine, anyhow,&rdquo; said Phil, now speaking for
the first time. &ldquo;I hould under Mister Martin, and his family was here
before the Leslies was heard of.&rdquo; These words were said with a certain air
of defiance, and a turn of the head around him, as though to imply, that
if any one would gainsay the opinion, he was ready to stand by and
maintain it. Happily for the peace of the particular moment, the crowd
were nearly all Martins, and so, a simple buzz of approbation followed
this announcement. Nor did their attention dwell much longer on the
matter, as most were already occupied in watching the progress of the
young man, who, at a fast swinging gallop, had taken to the fields beside
the lake, and was now seen flying in succession over each dyke and wall
before him, followed by his groom. The Irish passion for feats of
horsemanship made this the most fascinating attraction of the fair; and
already, opinions ran high among the crowd, that it was a race between the
two horses, and more than one maintained, that &ldquo;the little chap with the
belt&rdquo; was the better horseman of the two. At last, having made a wide
circuit of the village and the green, the riders were seen slowly moving
down, as if returning to the fair.
</p>
<p>
There is no country where manly sports and daring exercises are held in
higher repute than Ireland. The chivalry that has died out in richer lands
still reigns there; and the fall meed of approbation will ever be his, who
can combine address and courage before an Irish crowd. It is needless to
say, then, that many a word of praise and commendation was bestowed on
young Leslie. His handsome features, his slight but well-formed figure,
every particular of his dress and gesture, had found an advocate and an
admirer; and while some were lavish in their epithets on the perfection of
his horsemanship, others, who had seen him on foot, asserted, &ldquo;that it was
then he looked well entirely.&rdquo; There is a kind of epidemic character
pertaining to praise. The snow-ball gathers not faster by rolling, than do
the words of eulogy and approbation; and so now, many recited little
anecdotes of the youth&rsquo;s father, to shew that he was a very pattern of
landlords and country gentlemen, and had only one fault in life,&mdash;that
he never lived among his tenantry.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis the first time I ever set eyes on him,&rdquo; cried one, &ldquo;and I hould my
little place under him twenty-three years come Michaelmas.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;See now then, Barney,&rdquo; cried another, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have a hard man that
would stay here among us, than the finest landlord ever was seen that
would be away from us. And what&rsquo;s the use of compassion and pity when the
say would be between us? &lsquo;Tis the Agent we have to look to.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Agent! &lsquo;Tis wishing them, I am, the same Agents! Them&rsquo;s the boys has no
marcy for a poor man: I&rsquo;m tould now&rdquo;&mdash;and here the speaker assumed a
tone of oracular seriousness that drew several listeners towards him&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
tould now, the Agents get a guinea for every man, woman, and child they
turn out of a houldin.&rdquo; A low murmur of indignant anger ran through the
group, not one of whom ventured to disbelieve a testimony thus accredited.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And sure when the landlords does come, devil a bit they know about us&mdash;no
more nor if we were in Swayden; didn&rsquo;t I hear the ould gentleman down
there last summer, pitying the people for the distress. &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; says he,
it&rsquo;s a hard sayson ye have, and obliged to tear the flax out of the
ground, and it not long enough to cut!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A ready burst of laughter followed this anecdote, and many similar stories
were recounted in corroboration of the opinion.

</div>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the girl takes the shine out of the fair,&rdquo; said one of the younger
men of the party, touching another by the arm, and pointing to a tall
young girl, who, with features as straight and regular as a classic model,
moved slowly past. She did not wear the scarlet cloak of the peasantry,
but a large one of dark blue, lined with silk of the same colour; a
profusion of brown hair, dark and glossy, was braided on each side of her
face, and turned up at the back of the head with the grace of an antique
cameo. She seemed not more than nineteen years of age, and in the gaze of
astonishment and pleasure she threw around her, it might be seen how new
such scenes and sights were to her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Phil Joyce&rsquo;s sister, and a crooked disciple of a brother she has,&rdquo;
 said the other; &ldquo;sorra bit if he&rsquo;d ever let her come to the &lsquo;pattern&rsquo;
afore to-day; and she&rsquo;s the raal ornament of the place now she&rsquo;s in it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just mind Phil, will ye! watch him now; see the frown he&rsquo;s giving the
boys as they go by, for looking at his sister. I wouldn&rsquo;t coort a girl
that I couldn&rsquo;t look in the face and see what was in it, av she owned
Ballinahinch Castle,&rdquo; said the former.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There now; what is he at now?&rdquo; whispered the other; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s left her in the
tent there: and look at him, the way he&rsquo;s talking to ould Bill; he&rsquo;s
telling him something about a fight; never mind me agin, but there&rsquo;ll be
wigs on the green&rsquo; this night.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where the Lynchs and the Connors is to-day,&rdquo; said the other,
casting a suspicious look around him, as if anxious to calculate the
forces available in the event of a row. &ldquo;They gave the Joyces their own in
Ballinrobe last fair. I hope they&rsquo;re not afeard to come down here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sorra bit, ma bouchai,&rdquo; said a voice from behind his shoulder; and at the
same moment the speaker clapped his hands over the other&rsquo;s eyes: &ldquo;Who am
I, now?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Arrah! Owen Connor; I know ye well,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;and His yourself
ought not to be here to-day. The ould father of ye has nobody but yourself
to look after him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see ye call him ould to his face,&rdquo; said Owen, laughing:
&ldquo;there he is now, in Poll Dawley&rsquo;s tent, dancing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dancing!&rdquo; cried the other two in a breath.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Aye, faix, dancing &lsquo;The little bould fox;&rsquo; and may I never die in sin, if
he hasn&rsquo;t a step that looks for all the world as if he made a hook and eye
of his legs.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The young man who spoke these words was in mould and gesture the very
ideal of an Irish peasant of the west; somewhat above the middle size,
rather slightly made, but with the light and neatly turned proportion that
betokens activity, more than great strength, endurance, rather than the
power of any single effort. His face well became the character of his
figure; it was a handsome and an open one, where the expressions changed
and crossed each other with lightning speed, now, beaming with good
nature, now, flashing in anger, now, sparkling with some witty conception,
or frowning a bold defiance as it met the glance of some member of a rival
faction. He looked, as he was, one ready and willing to accept either part
from fortune, and to exchange friendship and hard knocks with equal
satisfaction. Although in dress and appearance he was both cleanly and
well clad, it was evident that he belonged to a very humble class among
the peasantry. Neither his hat nor his greatcoat, those unerring signs of
competence, had been new for many a day before; and his shoes, in their
patched and mended condition, betrayed the pains it had cost him to make
even so respectable an appearance as he then presented.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t even give you a look to-day, Owen,&rdquo; said one of the former
speakers; &ldquo;she turned her head the other way as she went by.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faix, I&rsquo;m afeard ye&rsquo;ve a bad chance,&rdquo; said the other.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Joke away, boys, and welcome,&rdquo; said Owen, reddening to the eyes as he
spoke, and shewing that his indifference to their banterings was very far
from being real; &ldquo;&lsquo;tis little I mind what ye say,&mdash;as little as she
herself would mind <i>me</i>,&rdquo; added he to himself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the purtiest girl in the town-land, and no second word to it,&mdash;and
even if she hadn&rsquo;t a fortune&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bad luck to the fortune!&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I say,&rdquo; cried Owen, suddenly;
&ldquo;&lsquo;tis that same that breaks my rest night and day; sure if it wasn&rsquo;t for
the money, there&rsquo;s many a dacent boy wouldn&rsquo;t be ashamed nor afeard to go
up and coort her.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have two hundred, divil a less, I&rsquo;m tould,&rdquo; interposed the other;
&ldquo;the ould man made a deal of money in the war-time.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish he had it with him now,&rdquo; said Owen, bitterly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;By all accounts he wouldn&rsquo;t mislike it himself. When Father John was
giving him the rites, he says, &lsquo;Phil,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;how ould are ye now?&rsquo; and
the other didn&rsquo;t hear him, but went on muttering to himself; and the
Priest says agin, &lsquo;Tis how ould you are, I&rsquo;m axing.&rsquo; &lsquo;A hundred and
forty-three,&rsquo; says Phil, looking up at him. &lsquo;The Saints be good to us,&rsquo;
says Father John, &lsquo;sure you&rsquo;re not that ould,&mdash;a hundred and
forty-three?&rsquo; &lsquo;A hundred and forty-seven.&rsquo; &lsquo;Phew! he&rsquo;s more of it&mdash;a
hundred and forty-seven!&rsquo; &lsquo;A hundred and fifty,&rsquo; cries Phil, and he gave
the foot of the bed a little kick, this way&mdash;sorra more&mdash;and he
died; and what was it but the guineas he was countin&rsquo; in a stocking under
the clothes all the while? Oh, musha! how his sowl was in the money, and
he going to leave it all! I heerd Father John say, &lsquo;it was well they found
it out, for there&rsquo;d be a curse on them guineas, and every hand that would
touch one of them <i>in secla seclorum</i>;&rsquo; and they wer&rsquo; all tuck away
in a bag that night, and buried by the Priest in a saycret place, where
they&rsquo;ll never be found till the Day of Judgment.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Just as the story came to its end, the attention of the group was drawn
off by seeing numbers of people running in a particular direction, while
the sound of voices and the general excitement shewed something new was
going forward. The noise increased, and now, loud shouts were heard,
mingled with the rattling of sticks and the utterance of those party cries
so popular in an Irish fair. The young men stood still as if the affair
was a mere momentary ebullition not deserving of attention, nor
sufficiently important to merit the taking any farther interest in it; nor
did they swerve from the resolve thus tacitly formed, as from time to time
some three or four would emerge from the crowd, leading forth one, whose
bleeding temples, or smashed head, made retreat no longer dishonourable.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re at it early,&rdquo; was the cool commentary of Owen Connor, as with a
smile of superciliousness he looked towards the scene of strife.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Joyces is always the first to begin,&rdquo; remarked one of his companions.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And the first to lave off too,&rdquo; said Owen; &ldquo;two to one is what they call
fair play.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Phil&rsquo;s voice!&mdash;there now, do you hear him shouting?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis that he&rsquo;s best at,&rdquo; said Owen, whose love for the pretty Mary Joyce
was scarcely equalled by his dislike of her ill-tempered brother.
</p>
<p>
At this moment the shouts became louder and wilder, the screams of the
women mingling with the uproar, which no longer seemed a mere passing
skirmish, but a downright severe engagement.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What is it all about, Christy?&rdquo; said Owen, to a young fellow led past
between two friends, while the track of blood marked every step he went.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis well it becomes yez to ax,&rdquo; muttered the other, with his swollen and
pallid lips, &ldquo;when the Martins is beating your landlord&rsquo;s eldest son to
smithereens.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Leslie&mdash;young Mr. Leslie?&rdquo; cried the three together; but a wild
war-whoop from the crowd gave the answer back. &ldquo;Hurroo! Martin for ever!
Down with the Leslies! Ballinashough! Hurroo! Don&rsquo;t leave one of them
living! Beat their sowles out!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Leslie for ever!&rdquo; yelled out Owen, with a voice heard over every part of
the field; and with a spring into the air, and a wild flourish of his
stick, he dashed into the crowd.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Owen Connor, make way for Owen;&rdquo; cried the non-combatants, as they
jostled and parted each other, to leave a free passage for one whose
prowess was well known.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll lave his mark on some of yez yet!&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the boy will give you
music to dance to!&rdquo; &ldquo;Take that, Barney!&rdquo; &ldquo;Ha! Terry, that made your nob
ring like a forty-shilling pot!&rdquo; Such and such-like were the comments on
him who now, reckless of his own safety, rushed madly into the very midst
of the combatants, and fought&rsquo; his way onwards to where some seven or
eight were desperately engaged over the fallen figure of a man. With a
shrill yell no Indian could surpass, and a bound like a tiger, Owen came
down in the midst of them, every stroke of his powerful blackthorn telling
on his man as unerringly as though it were wielded by the hand of a giant.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Save the young Master, Owen! Shelter him! Stand over him, Owen Connor!&rdquo;
 were how the cries from all sides; and the stout-hearted peasant, striding
over the body of young Leslie, cleared a space around him, and, as he
glanced defiance on all sides, called out, &ldquo;Is that your courage, to beat
a young gentleman that never handled a stick in his life? Oh, you cowardly
set! Come and face the men of your own barony if you dare! Come out on the
green and do it!&mdash;Pull him away&mdash;pull him away quick,&rdquo; whispered
he to his own party eagerly. &ldquo;Tear-an-ages! get him out of this before
they&rsquo;re down on me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
As he spoke, the Joyces rushed forward with a cheer, their party now
trebly as strong as the enemy. They bore down with a force that nothing
could resist. Poor Owen&mdash;the mark for every weapon&mdash;fell almost
the first, his head and face one undistinguishable mass of blood and
bruises, but not before some three or four of his friends had rescued
young Leslie from his danger, and carried him to the outskirts of the
fair. The fray now became general, neutrality was impossible, and
self-defence almost suggested some participation in the battle. The
victory was, however, with the Joyces. They were on their own territory;
they mustered every moment stronger; and in less than half an hour they
had swept the enemy from the field, save where a lingering wounded man
remained, whose maimed and crippled condition had already removed him from
all the animosities of combat.

</div>
<p>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the young master?&rdquo; were the first words Owen Connor spoke, as his
friends carried him on the door of a cabin, hastily unhinged for the
purpose, towards his home.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Erra! he&rsquo;s safe enough, Owen,&rdquo; said one of his bearers, who was by no
means pleased that Mr. Leslie had made the best of his way out of the
fair, instead of remaining to see the fight out.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;God be praised for that same, anyhow!&rdquo; said Owen piously. &ldquo;His life was
not worth a &lsquo;trawneen&rsquo; when I seen him first.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It may be supposed from this speech, and the previous conduct of him who
uttered it, that Owen Connor was an old and devoted adherent of the Leslie
family, from whom he had received many benefits, and to whom he was linked
by long acquaintance. Far from it. He neither knew Mr. Leshe nor his
father. The former he saw for the first time as he stood over him in the
fair; the latter he had never so much as set eyes upon, at any time;
neither had he or his been favoured by them. The sole tie that subsisted
between them&mdash;the one link that bound the poor man to the rich one&mdash;was
that of the tenant to his landlord. Owen&rsquo;s father and grandfather before
him had been cottiers on the estate; but being very poor and humble men,
and the little farm they rented, a half-tilled half-reclaimed mountain
tract, exempt from all prospect of improvement, and situated in a remote
and unfrequented place, they were merely known by their names on the
rent-roll. Except for this, their existence had been as totally forgotten,
as though they had made part of the wild heath upon the mountain.
</p>
<p>
While Mr. Leslie lived in ignorance that such people existed on his
property, they looked up to him with a degree of reverence almost
devotional. The owner of the soil was a character actually sacred in their
eyes; for what respect and what submission were enough for one, who held
in his hands the destinies of so many; who could raise them to affluence,
or depress them to want, and by his mere word control the Agent himself,
the most dreaded of all those who exerted an influence on their fortunes?
</p>
<p>
There was a feudalism, too, in this sentiment that gave the reverence a
feeling of strong allegiance. The landlord was the head of a clan, as it
were; he was the culminating point of that pyramid of which they formed
the base; and they were proud of every display of his wealth and his
power, which they deemed as ever reflecting credit upon themselves. And
then, his position in the county&mdash;his rank&mdash;his titles&mdash;the
amount of his property&mdash;his house&mdash;his retinue&mdash;his very
equipage, were all subjects on which they descanted with eager delight,
and proudly exalted in contrast with less favoured proprietors. At the
time we speak of, absenteeism had only begun to impair the warmth of this
affection; the traditions of a resident landlord were yet fresh in the
memory of the young; and a hundred traits of kindness and good-nature were
mingled in their minds with stories of grandeur and extravagance, which,
to the Irish peasant&rsquo;s ear, are themes as grateful as ever the gorgeous
pictures of Eastern splendour were to the heightened imagination and
burning fancies of Oriental listeners.
</p>
<p>
Owen Connor was a firm disciple of this creed. Perhaps his lone
sequestered life among the mountains, with no companionship save that of
his old father, had made him longer retain these convictions in all their
force, than if, by admixture with his equals, and greater intercourse with
the world, he had conformed his opinions to the gradually changed tone of
the country. It was of little moment to him what might be the temper or
the habits of his landlord. The monarchy&mdash;and not the monarch of the
soil&mdash;was the object of his loyalty; and he would have deemed himself
disgraced and dishonoured had he shewn the slightest backwardness in his
fealty. He would as soon have expected that the tall fern that grew wild
in the valley should have changed into a blooming crop of wheat, as that
the performance of such a service could have met with any requital. It
was, to his thinking, a simple act of duty, and required not any prompting
of high principle, still less any suggestion of self-interest. Poor Owen,
therefore, had not even a sentiment of heroism to cheer him, as they bore
him slowly along, every inequality of the ground sending a pang through
his aching head that was actually torture.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a mark you&rsquo;ll carry to your dying day, Owen, my boy,&rdquo; said one of
the bearers, as they stopped for a moment to take breath. &ldquo;I can see the
bone there shining this minute.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It must be good stuff anyways the same head,&rdquo; said Owen, with a sickly
attempt to smile. &ldquo;They never put a star in it yet; and faix I seen the
sticks cracking like dry wood in the frost.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s well it didn&rsquo;t come lower down,&rdquo; said another, examining the deep
cut, which gashed his forehead from the hair down to the eyebrow. &ldquo;You
know what the Widow Glynn said at Peter Henessy&rsquo;s wake, when she saw the
stroke of the scythe that laid his head open&mdash;it just come, like yer
own, down to that&mdash;&lsquo;Ayeh!&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;but he&rsquo;s the fine corpse; and
wasn&rsquo;t it the Lord spared his eye!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stop, and good luck to you, Freney, and don&rsquo;t be making me laugh; the
pain goes through my brain like the stick of a knife,&rdquo; said Owen, as he
lifted his trembling hands and pressed them on either side of his head.
</p>
<p>
They wetted his lips with water, and resumed their way, not speaking aloud
as before, but in a low undertone, only audible to Owen at intervals; for
he had sunk into a half-stupid state, they believed to be sleep. The path
each moment grew steeper; for, leaving the wild &ldquo;boreen&rdquo; road, which led
to a large bog on the mountainside, it wound now upwards, zigzaging
between masses of granite rock and deep tufts of heather, where sometimes
the foot sunk to the instep. The wet and spongy soil increased the
difficulty greatly; and although all strong and powerful men, they were
often obliged to halt and rest themselves.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an elegant view, sure enough,&rdquo; said one, wiping his dripping
forehead with the tail of his coat. &ldquo;See there! look down where the fair
is, now! it isn&rsquo;t the size of a good griddle, the whole of it. How purty
the lights look shining in the water!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And the boats, too! Musha! they&rsquo;re coming up more of them. There&rsquo;ll be
good divarshin there, this night.&rdquo; These last words, uttered with a half
sigh, shewed with what a heavy heart the speaker saw himself debarred from
participating in the festivity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Twas a dhroll place to build a house then, up there,&rdquo; said another,
pointing to the dark speck, far, far away on the mountain, where Owen
Connor&rsquo;s cabin stood.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Owen says yez can see Galway of a fine day, and the boats going out from
the Claddagh; and of an evening, when the sun is going down, you&rsquo;ll see
across the bay, over to Clare, the big cliffs of Mogher.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now, then! are ye in earnest? I don&rsquo;t wonder he&rsquo;s so fond of the place
after all. It&rsquo;s an elegant thing to see the whole world, and fine company
besides. Look at Lough Mask! Now, boys, isn&rsquo;t that beautiful with the sun
on it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, it&rsquo;s getting late, Freney, and the poor boy ought to be at home
before night;&rdquo; and once more they lifted their burden and moved forward.
</p>
<p>
For a considerable time they continued to ascend without speaking, when
one of the party in a low cautious voice remarked, &ldquo;Poor Owen will think
worse of it, when he hears the reason of the fight, than for the cut on
the head&mdash;bad as it is.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Musha; then he needn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied another; &ldquo;for if ye mane about Mary
Joyce, he never had a chance of her.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying that he had,&rdquo; said the first speaker; &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s just as
fond of her; do you mind the way he never gave back one of Phil&rsquo;s blows,
but let him hammer away as fast as he plazed?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What was it at all, that Mr. Leslie did?&rdquo; asked another; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear
how it begun yet.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nor I either, rightly; but I believe Mary was standing looking at the
dance, for she never foots a step herself&mdash;maybe she&rsquo;s too ginteel&mdash;and
the young gentleman comes up and axes her for a partner; and something she
said; but what does he do, but put his arm round her waist and gives her a
kiss; and, ye see, the other girls laughed hearty, because they say,
Mary&rsquo;s so proud and high, and thinking herself above them all. Phil wasn&rsquo;t
there at the time; but he heerd it afterwards, and come up to the tent, as
young Mr. Leslie was laving it, and stood before him and wouldn&rsquo;t let him
pass. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a word to say to ye,&rsquo; says Phil, and he scarce able to spake
with passion; &lsquo;that was my sister ye had the impudence to take a liberty
with.&rsquo; &lsquo;Out of the way, ye bogtrotter,&rsquo; says Leslie: them&rsquo;s the very words
he said; &lsquo;out of the way, ye bog-trotter, or I&rsquo;ll lay my whip across your
shoulders.&rsquo; &lsquo;Take that first,&rsquo; says Phil; and he put his fist between his
two eyes, neat and clean;&mdash;down went the Squire as if he was shot.
You know the rest yourselves. The boys didn&rsquo;t lose any time, and if &lsquo;twas
only two hours later, maybe the Joyces would have got as good as they
gave.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A heavy groan from poor Owen now stopped the conversation, and they halted
to ascertain if he were worse,&mdash;but no; he seemed still sunk in the
same heavy sleep as before, and apparently unconscious of all about him.
Such, however, was not really the case; by some strange phenomenon of
sickness, the ear had taken in each low and whispered word, at the time it
would have been deaf to louder sounds; and every syllable they had spoken
had already sunk deeply into his heart; happily for him, this was hut a
momentary pang; the grief stunned him at once, and he became insensible.
</p>
<p>
It was dark night as they reached the lonely cabin where Owen lived, miles
away from any other dwelling, and standing at an elevation of more than a
thousand feet above the plain. The short, sharp barking of a sheep-dog was
the only sound that welcomed them; for the old man had not heard of his
son&rsquo;s misfortune until long after they quitted the fair. The door was
hasped and fastened with a stick; precaution enough in such a place, and
for all that it contained, too. Opening this, they carried the young man
in, and laid him upon the bed; and, while some busied themselves in
kindling a fire upon the hearth, the others endeavoured, with such skill
as they possessed, to dress his wounds, an operation which, if not
strictly surgical in all its details, had at least the recommendation of
tolerable experience in such matters.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nate little place when you&rsquo;re at it, then,&rdquo; said one of them, as
with a piece of lighted bog-pine he took a very leisurely and accurate
view of the interior.
</p>
<p>
The opinion, however, must be taken by the reader, as rather reflecting on
the judgment of him who pronounced it, than in absolute praise of the
object itself. The cabin consisted of a single room, and which, though
remarkably clean in comparison with similar ones, had no evidence of
anything above very narrow circumstances. A little dresser occupied the
wall in front of the door, with its usual complement of crockery, cracked
and whole; an old chest of drawers, the pride of the house, flanked this
on one side; a low settle-bed on the other; various prints in very florid
colouring decorated the walls, all religious subjects, where the Apostles
figured in garments like bathing-dresses; these were intermixed with
ballads, dying speeches, and suchlike ghostly literature, as form the most
interesting reading of an Irish peasant; a few seats of unpainted deal,
and a large straw chair for the old man, were the principal articles of
furniture. There was a gun, minus the lock, suspended over the fireplace;
and two fishing-rods, with a gaff and landing-net, were stretched upon
wooden pegs; while over the bed was an earthenware crucifix, with its
little cup beneath, for holy water; the whole surmounted by a picture of
St. Francis Xavier in the act of blessing somebody: though, if the gesture
were to be understood without the explanatory letter-press, he rather
looked like a swimmer preparing for a dive. The oars, mast, and spritsail
of a boat were lashed to the rafters overhead; for, strange as it may
seem, there was a lake at that elevation of the mountain, and one which
abounded in trout and perch, affording many a day&rsquo;s sport to both Owen and
his father.
</p>
<p>
Such were the details which, sheltered beneath a warm roof of
mountain-fern, called forth the praise we have mentioned; and, poor as
they may seem to the reader, they were many degrees in comfort beyond the
majority of Irish cabins.
</p>
<p>
The boys&mdash;for so the unmarried men of whatever age are called&mdash;having
left one of the party to watch over Owen, now quitted the house, and began
their return homeward. It was past midnight when the old man returned; and
although endeavouring to master any appearance of emotion before the
&ldquo;strange boy,&rdquo; he could with difficulty control his feelings on beholding
his son. The shirt matted with blood, contrasting with the livid
colourless cheek&mdash;the heavy irregular breathing&mdash;the frequent
startings as he slept&mdash;were all sore trials to the old man&rsquo;s nerve;
but he managed to seem calm and collected, and to treat the occurrence as
an ordinary one.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Harry Joyce and his brother Luke&mdash;big Luke as they call him&mdash;has
sore bones to-night; they tell me that Owen didn&rsquo;t lave breath in their
bodies,&rdquo; said he, with a grim smile, as he took his place by the fire.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I heerd the ribs of them smashing like an ould turf creel,&rdquo; replied the
other.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis himself can do it,&rdquo; said the old fellow, with eyes glistening with
delight; &ldquo;fair play and good ground, and I&rsquo;d back him agin the Glen.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And so you might, and farther too; he has the speret in him&mdash;that&rsquo;s
better nor strength, any day.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And thus consoled by the recollection of Owen&rsquo;s prowess, and gratified by
the hearty concurrence of his guest, the old father smoked and chatted
away till daybreak. It was not that he felt any want of affection for his
son, or that his heart was untouched by the sad spectacle he presented,&mdash;far
from this; the poor old man had no other tie to life&mdash;no other object
of hope or love than Owen; but years of a solitary life had taught him
rather to conceal his emotions within his own bosom, than seek for
consolation beyond it; besides that, even in his grief the old sentiment
of faction-hatred was strong, and vengeance had its share in his thoughts
also.
</p>
<p>
It would form no part of our object in this story, to dwell longer either
on this theme, or the subject of Owen&rsquo;s illness; it will be enough to say,
that he soon got better, far sooner perhaps than if all the appliances of
luxury had ministered to his recovery; most certainly sooner than if his
brain had been ordinarily occupied by thoughts and cares of a higher order
than his were. The conflict, however, had left a deeper scar behind, than
the ghastly wound that marked his brow. The poor fellow dwelt upon the
portions of the conversation he overheard as they carried him up the
mountain; and whatever might have been his fears before, now he was
convinced that all prospect of gaining Mary&rsquo;s love was lost to him for
ever.
</p>
<p>
This depression, natural to one after so severe an injury, excited little
remark from the old man; and although he wished Owen might make some
effort to exert himself, or even move about in the air, he left him to
himself and his own time, well knowing that he never was disposed to yield
an hour to sickness, beyond what he felt unavoidable.
</p>
<p>
It was about eight or nine days after the fair, that the father was
sitting mending a fishing-net at the door of his cabin, to catch the last
light of the fading day. Owen was seated near him, sometimes watching the
progress of the work, sometimes patting the old sheep-dog that nestled
close by, when the sound of voices attracted them: they listened, and
could distinctly hear persons talking at the opposite side of the cliff,
along which the pathway led; and before they could even hazard a guess as
to who they were, the strangers appeared at the angle of the rock. The
party consisted of two persons; one, a gentleman somewhat advanced in
life, mounted on a stout but rough-looking pony&mdash;the other, was a
countryman, who held the beast by the bridle, and seemed to take the
greatest precaution for the rider&rsquo;s safety.
</p>
<p>
The very few visitors Owen and his father met with were for the most part
people coming to fish the mountain-lake, who usually hired ponies in the
valley for the ascent; so that when they perceived the animal coming
slowly along, they scarce bestowed a second glance upon them, the old man
merely remarking, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re three weeks too early for this water, any how;&rdquo;
 a sentiment concurred in by his son. In less than five minutes after, the
rider and his guide stood before the door.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is this where Owen Connor lives?&rdquo; asked the gentleman.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That same, yer honor,&rdquo; said old Owen, uncovering his head, as he rose
respectfully from his low stool.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And where is Owen Connor himself?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis me, sir,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my name.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but it can scarcely be you that I am looking for; have you a son of
that name?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir, I&rsquo;m young Owen,&rdquo; said the young man, rising, but not without
difficulty; while he steadied himself by holding the door-post.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So then I am all right: Tracy, lead the pony about, till I call you;&rdquo; and
so saying, he dismounted and entered the cabin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sit down, Owen; yes, yes&mdash;I insist upon it, and do you, also. I have
come up here to-day to have a few moments&rsquo; talk with you about an
occurrence that took place last week at the fair. There was a young
gentleman, Mr. Leslie, got roughly treated by some of the people: let me
hear your account of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Owen and his father exchanged glances; the same idea flashed across the
minds of both, that the visitor was a magistrate come to take information
against the Joyces for an assault; and however gladly they would have
embraced any course that promised retaliation for their injuries, the
notion of recurring to the law was a degree of baseness they would have
scorned to adopt.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the &lsquo;vestment&rsquo; I never seen it at all,&rdquo; said the old man
eagerly, and evidently delighted that no manner of cross-questioning or
badgering could convert him into an informer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And the little I saw,&rdquo; said Owen, &ldquo;they knocked out of my memory with
this;&rdquo; and he pointed to the half-healed gash on his forehead.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But you know something of how the row begun?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, yer honor, I was at the other side of the fair.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Was young Mr. Leslie in fault&mdash;did you hear that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I never heerd that he did any thing&mdash;unagreeable,&rdquo; said Owen, after
hesitating for a few seconds in his choice of a word.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So then, I&rsquo;m not likely to obtain any information from either of you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
They made no reply, but their looks gave as palpable a concurrence to this
speech, as though they swore to its truth.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I have another question to ask. It was you saved this young
gentleman, I understand; what was your motive for doing so? when, as by
your own confession, you were at a distance when the fight begun.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He was my landlord&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; said Owen, half roughly; &ldquo;I hope there is no
law agin that.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I sincerely trust not,&rdquo; ejaculated the gentleman; &ldquo;have you been long on
the estate?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Three generations of us now, yer honor,&rdquo; said the old man.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what rent do you pay?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, musha, we pay enough! we pay fifteen shillings an acre for the bit of
callows below, near the lake, and we give ten pounds a year for the
mountain&mdash;and bad luck to it for a mountain&mdash;it&rsquo;s breaking my
heart, trying to make something out of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then I suppose you&rsquo;d be well pleased to exchange your farm, and take one
in a better and more profitable part of the country?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Another suspicion here shot across the old man&rsquo;s mind; and turning to Owen
he said in Irish: &ldquo;He wants to get the mountain for sporting over; but
I&rsquo;ll not lave it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The gentleman repeated his question.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Troth, no then, yer honor; we&rsquo;ve lived here so long we&rsquo;ll just stay our
time in it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But the rent is heavy, you say.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll pay it, plaze God.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a strange wild place in winter.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Its wholesome, any how,&rdquo; was the short reply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe I must go back again as wise as I came,&rdquo; muttered the
gentleman. &ldquo;Come, my good old man,&mdash;and you, Owen; I want to know how
I can best serve you, for what you&rsquo;ve done for me: it was my son you
rescued in the fair&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you the landlord&mdash;is yer honor Mr. Leslie?&rdquo; exclaimed both as
they rose from their seats, as horrified as if they had taken such a
liberty before Royalty.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Owen; and I grieve to say, that I should cause so much surprise to
any tenant, at seeing me. I ought to be better known on my property; and I
hope to become so: but it grows late, and I must reach the valley before
night. Tell me, are you really attached to this farm, or have I any other,
out of lease at this time, you like better?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I would not leave the ould spot, with yer honor&rsquo;s permission, to get a
demesne and a brick house; nor Owen neither.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, be it so; I can only say, if you ever change your mind,
you&rsquo;ll find me both ready and willing to serve you; meanwhile you must pay
no more rent, here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No more rent!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not a farthing; I&rsquo;m sorry the favour is so slight a one, for indeed the
mountain seems a bleak and profitless tract.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is not its equal for mutton&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it, Owen; and it only remains for me to make the shepherd
something more comfortable;&mdash;well, take this; and when I next come up
here, which I intend to do, to fish the lake, I hope to find you in a
better house;&rdquo; and he pressed a pocket-book into the old man&rsquo;s hand as he
said this, and left the cabin: while both Owen and his father were barely
able to mutter a blessing upon him, so overwhelming and unexpected was the
whole occurrence.

<h2>
SECOND ERA
</h2>
<p>
From no man&rsquo;s life, perhaps, is hope more rigidly excluded than from that
of the Irish peasant of a poor district. The shipwrecked mariner upon his
raft, the convict in his cell, the lingering sufferer on a sick hed, may
hope; but he must not.
</p>
<p>
Daily labour, barely sufficient to produce the commonest necessaries of
life, points to no period of rest or repose; year succeeds year in the
same dull routine of toil and privation; nor can he look around him and
see one who has risen from that life of misery, to a position of even
comparative comfort.
</p>
<p>
The whole study of his existence, the whole philosophy of his life, is,
how to endure; to struggle on under poverty and sickness; in seasons of
famine, in times of national calamity, to hoard up the little pittance for
his landlord and the payment for his Priest; and he has nothing more to
seek for. Were it our object here, it would not be difficult to pursue
this theme further, and examine, if much of the imputed slothfulness and
indolence of the people was not in reality due to that very hopelessness.
How little energy would be left to life, if you took away its ambitions;
how few would enter upon the race, if there were no goal before them! Our
present aim, however, is rather with the fortunes of those we have so
lately left. To these poor men, now, a new existence opened. Not the sun
of spring could more suddenly illumine the landscape where winter so late
had thrown its shadows, than did prosperity fall brightly on their hearts,
endowing life with pleasures and enjoyments, of which they had not dared
to dream before.
</p>
<p>
In preferring this mountain-tract to some rich lowland farm, they were
rather guided by that spirit of attachment to the home of their fathers&mdash;so
characteristic a trait in the Irish peasant&mdash;than by the promptings
of self-interest. The mountain was indeed a wild and bleak expanse, scarce
affording herbage for a few sheep and goats; the callows at its foot,
deeply flooded in winter, and even by the rains of autumn, made tillage
precarious and uncertain; yet the fact that these were rent-free, that of
its labour and its fruits all was now their own, inspired hope and
sweetened toil. They no longer felt the dreary monotony of daily exertion,
by which hour was linked to hour, and year to year, in one unbroken
succession;&mdash;no; they now could look forward, they could lift up
their hearts and strain their eyes to a future, where honest industry had
laid up its store for the decline of life; they could already fancy the
enjoyments of the summer season, when they should look down upon their own
crops and herds, or think of the winter nights, and the howling of the
storm without, reminding them of the blessings of a home.
</p>
<p>
How little to the mind teeming with its bright and ambitious aspirings
would seem the history of their humble hopes! how insignificant and how
narrow might appear the little plans and plots they laid for that new road
in life, in which they were now to travel! The great man might scoff at
these, the moralist might frown at their worldliness; but there is nothing
sordid or mean in the spirit of manly independence; and they who know the
Irish people, will never accuse them of receiving worldly benefits with
any forgetfulness of their true and only source. And now to our story.
</p>
<p>
The little cabin upon the mountain was speedily added to, and fashioned
into a comfortable-looking farmhouse of the humbler class. Both father and
son would willingly have left it as it was; but the landlord&rsquo;s wish had
laid a command upon them, and they felt it would have been a
misapplication of his bounty, had they not done as he had desired. So
closely, indeed, did they adhere to his injunctions, that a little room
was added specially for his use and accommodation, whenever he came on
that promised excursion he hinted at. Every detail of this little chamber
interested them deeply; and many a night, as they sat over their fire, did
they eagerly discuss the habits and tastes of the &ldquo;quality,&rdquo; anxious to be
wanting in nothing which should make it suitable for one like him.
</p>
<p>
Sufficient money remained above all this expenditure to purchase some
sheep, and even a cow; and already their changed fortunes had excited the
interest and curiosity of the little world in which they lived.
</p>
<p>
There is one blessing, and it is a great one, attendant on humble life.
The amelioration of condition requires not that a man should leave the
friends and companions he has so long sojourned with, and seek, in a new
order, others to supply their place; the spirit of class does not descend
to him, or rather, he is far above it; his altered state suggests
comparatively few enjoyments or comforts in which his old associates
cannot participate; and thus the Connors&rsquo; cabin was each Sunday thronged
by the country people, who came to see with their own eyes, and hear with
their own ears, the wonderful good fortune that befell them.
</p>
<p>
Had the landlord been an angel of light, the blessings invoked upon him
could not have been more frequent or fervent; each measured the
munificence of the act by his own short standard of worldly possessions;
and individual murmurings for real or fancied wrongs were hushed in the
presence of one such deed of benevolence.
</p>
<p>
This is no exaggerated picture. Such was peasant-gratitude once; and such,
O landlords of Ireland! it might still have been, if you had not deserted
the people. The meanest of your favours, the poorest show of your
good-feeling, were acts of grace for which nothing was deemed requital.
Your presence in the poor man&rsquo;s cabin&mdash;your kind word to him upon the
highway&mdash;your aid in sickness&mdash;your counsel in trouble, were
ties which bound him more closely to your interest, and made him more
surely yours, than all the parchments of your attorney, or all the papers
of your agent. He knew you then as something more than the recipient of
his earnings. That was a time, when neither the hireling patriot nor the
calumnious press could sow discord between you. If it be otherwise now,
ask yourselves, are you all blameless? Did you ever hope that affection
could be transmitted through your agent, like the proceeds of your
property? Did you expect that the attachments of a people were to reach
you by the post? Or was it not natural, that, in their desertion by you,
they should seek succour elsewhere? that in their difficulties and their
trials they should turn to any who might feel or feign compassion for
them?
</p>
<p>
Nor is it wonderful that, amid the benefits thus bestowed, they should
imbibe principles and opinions fatally in contrast with interests like
yours.
</p>
<p>
There were few on whom good fortune could have fallen, without exciting
more envious and jealous feelings on the part of others, than on the
Connors. The rugged independent character of the father&mdash;the gay
light-hearted nature of the son, had given them few enemies and many
friends. The whole neighbourhood flocked about them to offer their good
wishes and congratulations on their bettered condition, and with an
honesty of purpose and a sincerity that might have shamed a more elevated
sphere. The Joyces alone shewed no participation in this sentiment, or
rather, that small fraction of them more immediately linked with Phil
Joyce. At first, they affected to sneer at the stories of the Connors&rsquo;
good fortune; and when denial became absurd, they half-hinted that it was
a new custom in Ireland for men &ldquo;to fight for money.&rdquo; These mocking
speeches were not slow to reach the ears of the old man and his son; and
many thought that the next fair-day would bring with it a heavy
retribution for the calamities of the last. In this, however, they were
mistaken. Neither Owen nor his father appeared that day; the mustering of
their faction was strong and powerful, but they, whose wrongs were the
cause of the gathering, never came forward to head them.
</p>
<p>
This was an indignity not to be passed over in silence; and the murmurs,
at first low and subdued, grew louder and louder, until denunciations
heavy and deep fell upon the two who &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t come out and right
themselves like men.&rdquo; The faction, discomfited and angered, soon broke up;
and returning homeward in their several directions, they left the field to
the enemy without even a blow. On the succeeding day, when the observances
of religion had taken place of the riotous and disorderly proceedings of
the fair, it was not customary for the younger men to remain. The
frequenters of the place were mostly women; the few of the other sex were
either old and feeble men, or such objects of compassion as traded on the
pious feelings of the votaries so opportunely evoked. It was with great
difficulty the worthy Priest of the parish had succeeded in dividing the
secular from the holy customs of the time, and thus allowing the pilgrims,
as all were called on that day, an uninterrupted period for their
devotions. He was firm and resolute, however, in his purpose, and spared
no pains to effect it: menacing this one&mdash;persuading that; suiting
the measure of his arguments to the comprehension of each, he either
cajoled or coerced, as the circumstance might warrant. His first care was
to remove all the temptations to dissipation and excess; and for this
purpose, he banished every show and exhibition, and every tent where
gambling and drinking went forward;&mdash;his next, a more difficult task,
was the exclusion of all those doubtful characters, who, in every walk of
life, are suggestive of even more vice than they embody in themselves.
These, however, abandoned the place, of their own accord, so soon as they
discovered how few were the inducements to remain; until at length, by a
tacit understanding, it seemed arranged, that the day of penance and
mortification should suffer neither molestation nor interruption from
those indisposed to partake of its benefits. So rigid was the Priest in
exacting compliance in this matter, that he compelled the tents to be
struck by daybreak, except by those few, trusted and privileged
individuals, whose ministerings to human wants were permitted during the
day of sanctity.
</p>
<p>
And thus the whole picture was suddenly changed. The wild and riotous
uproar of the fair, the tumult of voices and music, dancing, drinking, and
fighting, were gone; and the low monotonous sound of the pilgrims&rsquo; prayers
was heard, as they moved along upon their knees to some holy well or
shrine, to offer up a prayer, or return a thanksgiving for blessings
bestowed. The scene was a strange and picturesque one; the long lines of
kneeling figures, where the rich scarlet cloak of the women predominated,
crossed and recrossed each other as they wended their way to the destined
altar; their muttered words blending with the louder and more boisterous
appeals of the mendicants,&mdash;who, stationed at every convenient angle
or turning, besieged each devotee with unremitting entreaty,&mdash;deep
and heartfelt devotion in every face, every lineament and feature
impressed with religious zeal and piety; but still, as group met group
going and returning, they interchanged their greetings between their
prayers, and mingled the worldly salutations with aspirations heavenward,
and their &ldquo;Paters,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Aves,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Credos,&rdquo; were blended with inquiries
for the &ldquo;childer,&rdquo; or questions about the &ldquo;crops.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that Owen Connor, avick, that&rsquo;s going there, towards the
Yallow-well?&rdquo; said an old crone as she ceased to count her beads.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right enough, Biddy; &lsquo;tis himself, and no other; it&rsquo;s a turn he
took to devotion since he grew rich.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ayeh! ayeh! the Lord be good to us! how fond we all be of life, when
we&rsquo;ve the bit of bacon to the fore!&rdquo; And with that she resumed her pious
avocations with redoubled energy, to make up for lost time.
</p>
<p>
The old ladies were as sharp-sighted as such functionaries usually are in
any sphere of society. It was Owen Connor himself, performing his first
pilgrimage. The commands of his landlord had expressly forbidden him to
engage in any disturbance at the fair; the only mode of complying with
which, he rightly judged, was by absenting himself altogether. How this
conduct was construed by others, we have briefly hinted at. As for
himself, poor fellow, if a day of mortification could have availed him any
thing, he needn&rsquo;t have appeared among the pilgrims;&mdash;a period of such
sorrow and suffering he had never undergone before. But in justice it must
be confessed, it was devotion of a very questionable character that
brought him there that morning. Since the fair-day, Mary Joyce had never
deigned to notice him; and though he had been several times at mass, she
either affected not to be aware of his presence, or designedly looked in
another direction. The few words of greeting she once gave him on every
Sunday morning&mdash;the smile she bestowed&mdash;dwelt the whole week in
his heart, and made him long for the return of the time, when, even for a
second or two, she would be near, and speak to him. He was not slow in
supposing how the circumstances under which he rescued the landlord&rsquo;s son
might be used against him by his enemies; and he well knew that she was
not surrounded by any others than such. It was, then, with a heavy heart
poor Owen witnessed how fatally his improved fortune had dashed hopes far
dearer than all worldly advantage. Not only did the new comforts about him
become distasteful, but he even accused them to himself as the source of
all his present calamity; and half suspected that it was a judgment on him
for receiving a reward in such a cause. To see her&mdash;to speak to her
if possible&mdash;was now his wish, morn and night; to tell her that he
cared more for one look, one glance, than for all the favours fortune did
or could bestow: this, and to undeceive her as to any knowledge of young
Leslie&rsquo;s rudeness to herself, was the sole aim of his thoughts. Stationing
himself therefore in an angle of the ruined church, which formed one of
the resting-places for prayer, he waited for hours for Mary&rsquo;s coming; and
at last, with a heart half sickened with deferred hope, he saw her pale
but beautiful features, shaded by the large blue hood of her cloak, as
with downcast eyes she followed in the train.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Give me your place, acushla; God will reward you for it; I&rsquo;m late at the
station,&rdquo; said he, to an old ill-favoured hag that followed next to Mary;
and at the same time, to aid his request, slipped half-a-crown into her
hand.
</p>
<p>
The wrinkled face brightened into a kind of wicked intelligence as she
muttered in Irish: &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a gould guinea the same place is worth; but I&rsquo;ll
give it to you for the sake of yer people;&rdquo; and at the same time pocketing
the coin in a canvass pouch, among relics and holy clay, she moved off, to
admit him in the line.
</p>
<p>
Owen&rsquo;s heart beat almost to bursting, as he found himself so close to
Mary; and all his former impatience to justify himself, and to speak to
her, fled in the happiness he now enjoyed. No devotee ever regarded the
relic of a Saint with more trembling ecstacy than did he the folds of that
heavy mantle that fell at his knees; he touched it as men would do a
sacred thing. The live-long day he followed her, visiting in turn each
shrine and holy spot; and ever, as he was ready to speak to her, some fear
that, by a word, he might dispel the dream of bliss he revelled in,
stopped him, and he was silent.
</p>

<p>
It was as the evening drew near, and the Pilgrims were turning towards the
lake, beside which, at a small thorn-tree, the last &ldquo;station&rdquo; of all was
performed, that an old beggar, whose importunity suffered none to escape,
blocked up the path, and prevented Mary from proceeding until she had
given him something. All her money had been long since bestowed; and she
said so, hurriedly, and endeavoured to move forward.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let Owen Connor, behyind you, give it, acushla! He&rsquo;s rich now, and can
well afford it,&rdquo; said the cripple.
</p>
<p>
She turned around at the words; the action was involuntary, and their eyes
met. There are glances which reveal the whole secret of a lifetime; there
are looks which dwell in the heart longer and deeper than words. Their
eyes met for merely a few seconds; and while in <i>her</i> face offended
pride was depicted, poor Owen&rsquo;s sorrow-struck and broken aspect spoke of
long suffering and grief so powerfully, that, ere she turned away, her
heart had half forgiven him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You wrong me hardly, Mary,&rdquo; said he, in a low, broken voice, as the train
moved on. &ldquo;The Lord, he knows my heart this blessed day! <i>Pater noster,
qui es in colis?</i>&rsquo;&rdquo; added he, louder, as he perceived that his
immediate follower had ceased his prayers to listen to him. &ldquo;He knows that
I&rsquo;d rather live and die the poorest&mdash;&lsquo;Beneficat tuum nomen!&rsquo;&rdquo; cried
he, louder. And then, turning abruptly, said:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Av it&rsquo;s plazing to you, sir, don&rsquo;t be trampin&rsquo; on my heels. I can&rsquo;t mind
my devotions, an&rsquo; one so near me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so unconvaynient, maybe, when they&rsquo;re afore you,&rdquo; muttered the
old fellow, with a grin of sly malice. And though Owen overheard the
taunt, he felt no inclination to notice it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Four long years I&rsquo;ve loved ye, Mary Joyce; and the sorra more
encouragement I ever got nor the smile ye used to give me. And if ye take
<i>that</i> from me, now&mdash;Are ye listening to me, Mary? do ye hear
me, asthore?&mdash;Bad scran to ye, ye ould varmint! why won&rsquo;t ye keep
behind? How is a man to save his sowl, an&rsquo; you making him blasphame every
minit?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was only listenin&rsquo; to that elegant prayer ye were saying,&rdquo; said the old
fellow, drily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis betther you&rsquo;d mind your own, then,&rdquo; said Owen, fiercely; &ldquo;or, by the
blessed day, I&rsquo;ll teach ye a new penance ye never heerd of afore!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The man dropped back, frightened at the sudden determination these words
were uttered in; and Owen resumed his place.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I may never see ye again, Mary. &lsquo;Tis the last time you&rsquo;ll hear me spake
to you. I&rsquo;ll lave the ould man. God look to him! I&rsquo;ll lave him now, and go
be a sodger. Here we are now, coming to this holy well; and I&rsquo;ll swear an
oath before the Queen of Heaven, that before this time to-morrow&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How is one to mind their prayers at all, Owen Connor, if ye be talking to
yourself, so loud?&rdquo; said Mary, in a whisper, but one which lost not a
syllable, as it fell on Owen&rsquo;s heart.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My own sweet darling, the light of my eyes, ye are!&rdquo; cried he, as with
clasped hands he muttered blessings upon her head; and with such vehemence
of gesture, and such unfeigned signs of rapture, as to evoke remarks from
some beggars near, highly laudatory of his zeal.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Look at the fine young man there, prayin&rsquo; wid all his might. Ayeh, the
Saints give ye the benefit of your Pilgrimage!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Musha! but ye&rsquo;r a credit to the station; ye put yer sowl in it, anyhow!&rdquo;
 said an old Jezebel, whose hard features seemed to defy emotion.
</p>
<p>
Owen looked up; and directly in front of him, with his back against a
tree, and his arms crossed on his breast, stood Phil Joyce: his brow was
dark with passion, and his eyes glared like those of a maniac. A cold
thrill ran through Owen&rsquo;s heart, lest the anger thus displayed should fall
on Mary; for he well knew with what tyranny the poor girl was treated. He
therefore took the moment of the pilgrims&rsquo; approach to the holy tree, to
move from his place, and, by a slightly circuitous path, came up to where
Joyce was standing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a word for you, Phil Joyce,&rdquo; said he, in a low voice, where every
trace of emotion was carefully subdued. &ldquo;Can I spake it to you here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Owen&rsquo;s wan and sickly aspect, if it did not shock, it at least astonished
Joyce, for he looked at him for some seconds without speaking; then said,
half rudely:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, here will do as well as any where, since ye didn&rsquo;t like to say it
yesterday.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There was no mistaking this taunt; the sneer on Owen&rsquo;s want of courage was
too plain to be misconstrued; and although for a moment he looked as if
disposed to resent it, he merely shook his head mournfully, and replied:
&ldquo;It is not about that I came to speak; it&rsquo;s about your sister, Mary
Joyce.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Phil turned upon him a stare of amazement, as quickly followed by a laugh,
whose insulting mockery made Owen&rsquo;s cheek crimson with shame.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;True enough, Phil Joyce; I know your meanin&rsquo; well,&rdquo; said he, with an
immense effort to subdue his passion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a poor cottier, wid a bit of
mountain-land&mdash;sorra more&mdash;and has no right to look up to one
like her. But listen to me, Phil!&rdquo; and here he grasped his arm, and spoke
with a thick guttural accent: &ldquo;Listen to me! Av the girl wasn&rsquo;t what she
is, but only your sister, I&rsquo;d scorn her as I do yourself;&rdquo; and with that,
he pushed him from him with a force that made him stagger. Before he had
well recovered, Owen was again at his side, and continued:&mdash;&ldquo;And now,
one word more, and all&rsquo;s ended between us. For you, and your likings or
mis-likings, I never cared a rush: but &lsquo;tis Mary herself refused me, so
there&rsquo;s no more about it; only don&rsquo;t be wreaking your temper on her, for
she has no fault in it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Av a sister of mine ever bestowed a thought on the likes o&rsquo; ye, I&rsquo;d give
her the outside of the door this night,&rdquo; said Joyce, whose courage now
rose from seeing several of his faction attracted to the spot, by
observing that he and Connor were conversing. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a disgrace&mdash;divil
a less than a disgrace to spake of it!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t do so any more, plaze God!&rdquo; said Owen, with a smile of
very fearful meaning. &ldquo;It will be another little matter we&rsquo;ll have to
settle when we meet, next. There&rsquo;s a score there, not paid off yet:&rdquo; and
at the word he lifted his hat, and disclosed the deep mark of the
scarce-closed gash on his forehead: &ldquo;and so, good bye to ye.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A rude nod from Phil Joyce was all the reply, and Owen turned homewards.
</p>
<p>
If prosperity could suggest the frame of mind to enjoy it, the rich would
always be happy; but such is not the dispensation of Providence.
Acquisition is but a stage on the road of ambition; it lightens the way,
but brings the goal no nearer. Owen never returned to his mountain-home
with a sadder heart. He passed without regarding them, the little fields,
now green with the coming spring; he bestowed no look nor thought upon the
herds that already speckled the mountain-side; disappointment had
embittered his spirit; and even love itself now gave way to faction-hate,
the old and cherished animosity of party.
</p>
<p>
If the war of rival factions did not originally spring from the personal
quarrels of men of rank and station, who stimulated their followers and
adherents to acts of aggression and reprisal, it assuredly was
perpetuated, if not with their concurrence, at least permission; and many
were not ashamed to avow, that in these savage encounters the &ldquo;bad blood&rdquo;
 of the country was &ldquo;let out,&rdquo; at less cost and trouble than by any other
means. When legal proceedings were recurred to, the landlord, in his
capacity of magistrate, maintained the cause of his tenants; and, however
disposed to lean heavily on them himself, in the true spirit of tyranny he
opposed pressure from any other hand than his own. The people were
grateful for this advocacy&mdash;far more, indeed, than they often proved
for less questionable kindness. They regarded the law with so much dread&mdash;they
awaited its decisions with such uncertainty&mdash;that he who would
conduct them through its mazes was indeed a friend. But, was the
administration of justice, some forty or fifty years back in Ireland, such
as to excite or justify other sentiments? Was it not this tampering with
right and wrong, this recurrence to patronage, that made legal redress
seem an act of meanness and cowardice among the people? No cause was
decided upon its own merits. The influence of the great man&mdash;the
interest he was disposed to take in the case&mdash;the momentary condition
of county politics&mdash;with the general character of the individuals at
issue, usually determined the matter; and it could scarcely be expected
that a triumph thus obtained should have exercised any peaceful sway among
the people.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t be so bould to-day, av his landlord wasn&rsquo;t to the fore,&rdquo; was
Owen Connor&rsquo;s oft-repeated reflection, as he ascended the narrow pathway
towards his cabin; &ldquo;&lsquo;tis the good backing makes us brave, God help us!&rdquo;
 From that hour forward, the gay light-hearted peasant became dark, moody,
and depressed; the very circumstances which might be supposed calculated
to have suggested a happier frame of mind, only increased and embittered
his gloom. His prosperity made daily labour no longer a necessity.
Industry, it is true, would have brought more comforts about him, and
surrounded him with more appliances of enjoyment; but long habits of
endurance had made him easily satisfied on this score, and there were no
examples for his imitation which should make him strive for better. So
far, then, from the landlord&rsquo;s benevolence working for good, its operation
was directly the reverse; his leniency had indeed taken away the hardship
of a difficult and onerous payment, but the relief suggested no desire for
an equivalent amelioration of condition. The first pleasurable emotions of
gratitude over, they soon recurred to the old customs in every thing, and
gradually fell hack into all the observances of their former state, the
only difference being, that less exertion on their parts was now called
for than before.
</p>
<p>
Had the landlord been a resident on his property&mdash;acquainting himself
daily and hourly with the condition of his tenants&mdash;holding up
examples for their imitation&mdash;rewarding the deserving&mdash;discountenancing
the unworthy&mdash;extending the benefits of education among the young&mdash;and
fostering habits of order and good conduct among all, Owen would have
striven among the first for a place of credit and honour, and speedily
have distinguished himself above his equals. But alas! no; Mr. Leslie,
when not abroad, lived in England. Of his Irish estates he knew nothing,
save through the half-yearly accounts of his agent. He was conscious of
excellent intentions; he was a kind, even a benevolent man; and in the
society of his set, remarkable for more than ordinary sympathies with the
poor. To have ventured on any reflection on a landlord before him, would
have been deemed a downright absurdity.
</p>
<p>
He was a living refutation of all such calumnies; yet how was it, that, in
the district he owned, the misery of the people was a thing to shudder at?
that there were hovels excavated in the bogs, within which human beings
lingered on between life and death, their existence like some terrible
passage in a dream? that beneath these frail roofs famine and fever dwelt,
until suffering, and starvation itself, had ceased to prey upon minds on
which no ray of hope ever shone? Simply he did not know of these things;
he saw them not; he never heard of them. He was aware that seasons of
unusual distress occurred, and that a more than ordinary degree of want
was experienced by a failure of the potato-crop; but on these occasions,
he read his name, with a subscription of a hundred pounds annexed, and was
not that a receipt in full for all the claims of conscience? He ran his
eyes over a list in which Royal and Princely titles figured, and he
expressed himself grateful for so much sympathy with Ireland! But did he
ask himself the question, whether, if he had resided among his people,
such necessities for alms-giving had ever arisen? Did he inquire how far
his own desertion of his tenantry&mdash;his ignorance of their state&mdash;his
indifference to their condition&mdash;had fostered these growing evils?
Could he acquit himself of the guilt of deriving all the appliances of his
ease and enjoyment, from those whose struggles to supply them were made
under the pressure of disease and hunger? Was unconsciousness of all this,
an excuse sufficient to stifle remorse? Oh, it is not the monied wealth
dispensed by the resident great man; it is not the stream of affluence,
flowing in its thousand tiny rills, and fertilising as it goes, we want.
It is far more the kindly influence of those virtues which. And their
congenial soil in easy circumstances; benevolence, sympathy, succour in
sickness, friendly counsel in distress, timely aid in trouble,
encouragement to the faint-hearted, caution to the over-eager: these are
gifts, which, giving, makes the bestower richer; and these are the
benefits which, better than gold, foster the charities of life among a
people, and bind up the human family in a holy and indissoluble league. No
benevolence from afar, no well wishings from distant lands, compensate for
the want of them. To neglect such duties is to fail in the great social
compact by which the rich and poor are united, and, what some may deem of
more moment still, to resign the rightful influence of property into the
hands of dangerous and designing men.
</p>
<p>
It is in vain to suppose that traditionary deservings will elicit
gratitude when the present generation are neglectful. On the contrary, the
comparison of the once resident, now absent landlord, excites very
different feelings; the murmurings of discontent swell into the louder
language of menace; and evils, over which no protective power of human
origin could avail, are ascribed to that class, who, forgetful of one
great duty, are now accused of causing every calamity. If not present to
exercise the duties their position demands, their absence exaggerates
every accusation against them; and from the very men, too, who have, by
the fact of their desertion, succeeded in obtaining the influence that
should be theirs.
</p>
<p>
Owen felt this desertion sorely. Had Mr. Leslie been at home, he would at
once have had recourse to him. Mr. French, the agent, lived on the
property&mdash;but Mr. French was &ldquo;a hard man,&rdquo; and never liked the
Connors; indeed, he never forgave them for not relinquishing the
mountain-farm they held, in exchange for another he offered them, as he
was anxious to preserve the mountain for his own shooting. At the time we
speak of, intemperance was an Irish vice, and one which prevailed largely.
Whisky entered into every circumstance and relation of life. It cemented
friendships and ratified contracts; it celebrated the birth of the
newly-born, it consoled the weeping relatives over the grave of the
departed; it was a welcome and a bond of kindness, and, as the
stirrup-cup, was the last pledge at parting. Men commemorated their
prosperity by drink, and none dared to face gloomy fortune without it.
Owen Connor had recourse to it, as to a friend that never betrayed. The
easy circumstances, in comparison with many others, he enjoyed, left him
both means and leisure for such a course; and few days passed without his
paying a visit to the &ldquo;shebeen-house&rdquo; of the village. If the old man
noticed this new habit, his old prejudices were too strong to make him
prompt in condemning it. Indeed, he rather regarded it as a natural
consequence of their bettered fortune, that Owen should frequent these
places; and as he never returned actually drunk, and always brought back
with him the current rumours of the day, as gathered from newspapers and
passing gossip, his father relied on such scraps of information for his
evening&rsquo;s amusement over the fire.
</p>
<p>
It was somewhat later than usual that Owen was returning home one night,
and the old man, anxious and uneasy at his absence, had wandered part of
the way to meet him, when he saw him coming slowly forward, with that
heavy weariness of step, deep grief and pre-occupation inspire. When the
young man had come within speaking distance of his father, he halted
suddenly, and looking up at him, exclaimed, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s sorrowful news for ye
to-night, father!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I knew it! I knew it well!&rdquo; said the old man, as he clasped his hands
before him, and seemed preparing himself to bear the shock with courage.
&ldquo;I had a dhrame of it last night; and &lsquo;tis death, wherever it is.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right there. The master&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Not another word was spoken by either, as side by side they slowly
ascended the mountain-path. It was only when seated at the fire-side, that
Owen regained sufficient collectedness to detail the particulars he had
learned in the village. Mr. Leslie had died of the cholera at Paris. The
malady had just broken out in that city, and he was among its earliest
victims. The terrors which that dreadful pestilence inspired, reached
every remote part of Europe, and at last, with all the aggravated horrors
of its devastating career, swept across Ireland. The same letter which
brought the tidings of Mr. Leslie&rsquo;s death, was the first intelligence of
the plague. A scourge so awful needed not the fears of the ignorant to
exaggerate its terrors; yet men seemed to vie with each other in their
dreadful conjectures regarding it.
</p>
<p>
All the sad interest the landlord&rsquo;s sudden death would have occasioned
under other circumstances was merged in the fearful malady of which he
died. Men heard with almost apathy of the events that were announced as
likely to succeed, in the management of the property; and only listened
with eagerness if the pestilence were mentioned. Already its arrival in
England was declared; and the last lingering hope of the devotee was, that
the holy island of St. Patrick might escape its ravages. Few cared to hear
what a few weeks back had been welcome news&mdash;that the old agent was
to be dismissed, and a new one appointed. The speculations which once
would have been rife enough, were now silent. There was but one terrible
topic in every heart and on every tongue&mdash;the Cholera.
</p>
<p>
The inhabitants of great cities, with wide sources of information
available, and free conversation with each other, can scarcely estimate
the additional degree of terror the prospect of a dreadful epidemic
inspires among the dwellers in unfrequented rural districts. The cloud,
not bigger than a man&rsquo;s hand at first, gradually expands itself, until the
whole surface of earth is darkened by its shadow. The business of life
stands still; the care for the morrow is lost; the proneness to indulge in
the gloomiest anticipations common calamity invariably suggests, heightens
the real evil, and disease finds its victims more than doomed at its first
approach. In this state of agonising suspense, when rumours arose to be
contradicted, reasserted, and again disproved, came the tidings that the
Cholera was in Dublin. The same week it had broken out in many other
places; at last the report went, that a poor man, who had gone into the
market of Galway to sell his turf, was found dead on the steps of the
chapel. Then, followed the whole array of precautionary measures, and
advices, and boards of health. Then, it was announced that the plague was
raging fearfully&mdash;the hospitals crowded&mdash;death in every street.
</p>
<p>
Terrible and appalling as these tidings were, the fearful fact never
realised itself in the little district we speak of, until a death occurred
in the town close by. He was a shopkeeper in Oughterarde, and known to the
whole neighbourhood. This solitary instance brought with it more of
dreadful meaning than all the shock of distant calamity. The heart-rending
wail of those who listened to the news smote many more with the cold
tremour of coming death. Another case soon followed, a third, and a fourth
succeeded, all fatal; and the disease was among them.
</p>
<p>
It is only when a malady, generally fatal, is associated with the terrors
of contagion, that the measure of horror and dread flows over. When the
sympathy which suffering sickness calls for is yielded in a spirit of
almost despair, and the ministerings to the dying are but the prelude to
the same state, then indeed death is armed with all his terrors. No people
are more remarkable for the charities of the sick-bed than the poor Irish.
It is with them less a sentiment than a religious instinct; and though
they watched the course of the pestilence, and saw few, if any, escape
death who took it, their devotion never failed them. They practised, with
such skill as they possessed, every remedy in turn. They, who trembled but
an hour before at the word when spoken, faced the danger itself with a
bold heart; and, while the insidious signs of the disease were already
upon them&mdash;while their wearied limbs and clammy hands bespoke that
their own hour was come, they did not desist from their good offices,
until past the power to render them.
</p>
<p>
It was spring-time, the season more than usually mild, the prospects of
the year were already favourable, and all the signs of abundance rife in
the land. What a contrast the scene without to that presented by the
interior of each dwelling! There, death and dismay were met with at every
step. The old man and the infant prostrated by the same stroke; the strong
and vigorous youth who went forth to labour in the morning&mdash;at noon,
a feeble, broken-spirited creature&mdash;at sunset, a corpse.
</p>
<p>
As the minds and temperaments of men were fashioned, so did fear operate
upon them. Some, it made reckless and desperate, careless of what should
happen, and indifferent to every measure of precaution; some, became
paralysed with fear, and seemed unable to make an effort for safety, were
it even attainable; others, exaggerating every care and caution, lived a
life of unceasing terror and anxiety; while a few&mdash;they were
unfortunately a very few&mdash;summoned courage to meet the danger in a
spirit of calm and resolute determination; while in their reformed habits
it might be seen how thoroughly they felt that their own hour might be a
brief one. Among these was Owen Connor. From the day the malady appeared
in the neighbourhood, he never entered the public-house of the village,
but, devoting himself to the work of kindness the emergency called for,
went from cabin to cabin rendering every service in his power. The poorest
depended on him for the supply of such little comforts as they possessed,
for at every market-day he sold a sheep or a lamb to provide them; the
better-off looked to him for advice and counsel, following his directions
as implicitly as though he were a physician of great skill. All recognised
his devotedness in their cause, and his very name was a talisman for
courage in every humble cabin around. His little ass-cart, the only
wheeled vehicle that ever ascended the mountain where he lived, was seen
each morning moving from door to door, while Owen brought either some
small purchase he was commissioned to make at Oughterarde, or left with
the more humble some offering of his own benevolence.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the salt ye bid me buy, Mary Cooney; and here&rsquo;s fourpence out of
it,&mdash;do ye all be well, still?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We are, and thank ye, Owen.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lord keep ye so!&rdquo; &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Ned Daly?&rdquo;
 &ldquo;He&rsquo;s off, Owen dear; his brother James is making the coffin; poor boy, he
looks very weak himself this morning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The cart moved on, and at length stopped at a small hovel built against
the side of a clay ditch. It was a mere assemblage of wet sods with the
grass still growing, and covered by some branches of trees and loose straw
over them. Owen halted the ass at the opening of the miserable den,
through which the smoke now issued, and at the same moment a man, stooping
double to permit him to pass out into the open air, came forward: he was
apparently about fifty years of age&mdash;his real age was not thirty;
originally a well-formed and stout-built fellow, starvation and want had
made him a mere skeleton. His clothes were, a ragged coat, which he wore
next his skin, for shirt he had none, and a pair of worn corduroy
trousers; he had neither hat, shoes, nor stockings; but still, all these
signs of destitution were nothing in comparison with the misery displayed
in his countenance. Except that his lip trembled with a convulsive shiver,
not a feature moved&mdash;the cheeks were livid and flattened&mdash;the
dull grey eyes had lost all the light of intelligence, and stared vacantly
before him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, Martin, how is she?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Owen dear,&rdquo; said he, in a faltering voice; &ldquo;maybe &lsquo;tis
sleeping she is.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Owen followed him within the hut, and stooping down to the fire, lighted a
piece of bogwood to enable him to see. On the ground, covered only by a
ragged frieze coat, lay a young woman quite dead: her arm, emaciated and
livid, was wrapped round a little child of about three years old, still
sleeping on the cold bosom of its mother.
</p>
<p>

<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">

</div>
<p>
&ldquo;You must take little Patsy away,&rdquo; said Owen in a whisper, as he lifted
the boy in his arms; &ldquo;<i>she&rsquo;s</i> happy now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The young man fell upon his knees and kissed the corpse, but spoke not a
word; grief had stupified his senses, and he was like one but half awake.
&ldquo;Come with me, Martin; come with me, and I&rsquo;ll settle every thing for you.&rdquo;
 He obeyed mechanically, and before quitting the cabin, placed some turf
upon the fire, as he was wont to do. The action was a simple one, but it
brought the tears into Owen&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of Patsy for you till
you want him. He&rsquo;s fond of me of ould, and won&rsquo;t be lonesome with me;&rdquo; and
Owen wrapped the child in his greatcoat, and moved forwards.
</p>
<p>
When they had advanced a few paces, Martin stopped suddenly and muttered,
&ldquo;She has nothing to drink!&rdquo; and then, as if remembering vaguely what had
happened, added, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long sleep, Ellen dear!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Owen gave the directions for the funeral, and leaving poor Martin in the
house of one of the cottiers near, where he sat down beside the hearth,
and never uttered a word; he went on his way, with little Patsy still
asleep within his arms.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where are you going, Peggy?&rdquo; asked Owen, as an old lame woman moved past
as rapidly as her infirmity would permit: &ldquo;you&rsquo;re in a hurry this
morning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So I am, Owen Connor&mdash;these is the busy times wid me&mdash;I
streaked five to-day, early as it is, and I&rsquo;m going now over to Phil
Joyce&rsquo;s. What&rsquo;s the matter wid yourself, Owen? sit down, avich, and taste
this.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong at Phil&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked Owen, with a choking fulness in his
throat.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the little brother he has; Billy&rsquo;s got it, they say.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is Mary Joyce well&mdash;did ye hear?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Errah! she&rsquo;s well enough now, but she may be low before night,&rdquo; muttered
the crone; while she added, with a fiendish laugh, &ldquo;her purty faytures
won&rsquo;t save her now, no more nor the rest of us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bottle of port wine, Peggy; take it with ye, dear. &lsquo;Tis the
finest thing at all, I&rsquo;m tould, for keeping it off&mdash;get Mary to take
a glass of it; but mind now, for the love o&rsquo; ye, never say it was me gav
it. There&rsquo;s bad blood between the Joyces and me, ye understand.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay, I know well enough,&rdquo; said the hag, clutching the bottle eagerly,
while opening a gate on the roadside, she hobbled on her way towards Phil
Joyce&rsquo;s cabin.
</p>
<p>
It was near evening as Owen was enabled to turn homewards; for besides
having a great many places to visit, he was obliged to stop twice to get
poor Patsy something to eat, the little fellow being almost in a state of
starvation. At length he faced towards the mountain, and with a sad heart
and weary step plodded along.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is poor Ellen buried?&rdquo; said he, as he passed the carpenter&rsquo;s door, where
the coffin had been ordered.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just laid in the mould&mdash;awhile ago.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope Martin bears up better;&mdash;did you see him lately?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This is for him,&rdquo; said the carpenter, striking a board with his hammer;
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s at peace now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Martin! sure he&rsquo;s not dead?&mdash;Martin Neale, I mean.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So do I too; he had it on him since morning, they say; but he just
slipped away without a word or a moan.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;O God, be good to us, but the times is dreadful!&rdquo; ejaculated Owen.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Some says it&rsquo;s the ind of the world&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said an old man, that sat
moving his stick listlessly among the shavings; &ldquo;and &lsquo;twould be well for
most of us it was too.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thrue for you, Billy; there&rsquo;s no help for the poor.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
No sentiment could meet more general acceptance than this&mdash;none less
likely to provoke denial. Thrown upon each other for acts of kindness and
benevolence, they felt from how narrow a store each contributed to
another&rsquo;s wants, and knew well all the privations that charity like this
necessitated, at the same time that they felt themselves deserted by those
whose generosity might have been exercised without sacrificing a single
enjoyment, or interfering with the pursuit of any accustomed pleasure.
</p>
<p>
There is no more common theme than the ingratitude of the poor&mdash;their
selfishness and hard-heartedness; and unquestionably a life of poverty is
but an indifferent teacher of fine feelings or gentle emotions. The dreary
monotony of their daily lives, the unvarying sameness of the life-long
struggle between labour and want, are little suggestive of any other
spirit than a dark and brooding melancholy: and it were well, besides, to
ask, if they who call themselves benefactors have been really generous,
and not merely just? We speak more particularly of the relations which
exist between the owner of the land and those who till it; and where
benevolence is a duty, and not a virtue depending on the will: not that
they, in whose behalf it is ever exercised, regard it in this light&mdash;very
far from it! Their thankfulness for benefits is generally most
disproportioned to their extent; but we are dissatisfied because our
charity has not changed the whole current of their fortunes, and that the
favours which cost us so little to bestow, should not become the ruling
principle of their lives.
</p>
<p>
Owen reflected deeply on these things as he ascended the mountain-road.
The orphan child he carried in his arms pressed such thoughts upon him,
and he wondered why rich men denied themselves the pleasures of
benevolence. He did not know that many great men enjoyed the happiness,
but that it was made conformable to their high estate by institutions and
establishments; by boards, and committees, and guardians; by all the pomp
and circumstance of stuccoed buildings and liveried attendants. That to
save themselves the burden of memory, their good deeds were chronicled in
lists of &ldquo;founders&rdquo; and &ldquo;life-subscribers,&rdquo; and their names set forth in
newspapers; while, to protect their finer natures from the rude assaults
of actual misery, they deputed others to be the stewards of their bounty.
</p>
<p>
Owen did not know all this, or he had doubtless been less unjust regarding
such persons. He never so much as heard of the pains that are taken to
ward off the very sight of poverty, and all the appliances employed to
exclude suffering from the gaze of the wealthy. All his little experience
told him was, how much of good might be done within the sphere around him
by one possessed of affluence. There was not a cabin around, where he
could not point to some object claiming aid or assistance. Even in seasons
of comparative comfort and abundance, what a deal of misery still existed;
and what a blessing it would bring on him who sought it out, to
compassionate and relieve it! So Owen thought, and so he felt too; not the
less strongly that another heart then beat against his own, the little
pulses sending a gush of wild delight through his bosom as he revelled in
the ecstacy of benevolence. The child awoke, and looked wildly about him;
but when he recognised in whose arms he was, he smiled happily, and cried,
&ldquo;Nony, Nony,&rdquo; the name by which Owen was known among all the children of
the village and its neighbourhood.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Patsy,&rdquo; said Owen, kissing him, &ldquo;your own Nony! you&rsquo;re coming home
with him to see what a nice house he has upon the mountain for you, and
the purty lake near it, and the fish swimming in it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0009" id="linkimage-0009">
<!-- IMG --></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/pat0104.jpg" width="100%" alt="104 " />
</div>
<p>
The little fellow clapped his hands with glee, and seemed delighted at all
he heard.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor darlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; muttered Owen, sorrowfully; &ldquo;he doesn&rsquo;t know &lsquo;tis the sad
day for him;&rdquo; and as he spoke, the wind from the valley bore on it the
mournful cadence of a death-cry, as a funeral moved along the road. &ldquo;His
father&rsquo;s berrin&rsquo;!&rdquo; added he. &ldquo;God help us! how fast misfortune does be
overtaking us at the time our heart&rsquo;s happiest! It will be many a day
before he knows all this morning cost him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The little child meanwhile caught the sounds, and starting up in Owen&rsquo;s
arms, he strained his eyes to watch the funeral procession as it slowly
passed on. Owen held him up for a few seconds to see it, and wiped the
large tears that started to his own eyes. &ldquo;Maybe Martin and poor Ellen&rsquo;s
looking down on us now!&rdquo; and with that he laid the little boy back in his
arms and plodded forward.
</p>
<p>
It was but seldom that Owen Connor ascended that steep way without halting
to look down on the wide valley, and the lake, and the distant mountains
beyond it. The scene was one of which he never wearied; indeed, its
familiarity had charms for him greater and higher than mere picturesque
beauty can bestow. Each humble cabin with its little family was known to
him; he was well read in the story of their lives; he had mingled in all
their hopes and fears from childhood to old age; and, as the lights
trembled through the dark night, and spangled the broad expanse, he could
bring before his mind&rsquo;s eye the humble hearths round which they sat, and
think he almost heard their voices. Now, he heeded not these things, but
steadily bent his steps towards home.
</p>
<p>
At last, the twinkle of a star-like light shewed that he was near his
journey&rsquo;s end. It shone from the deep shadow of a little glen, in which
his cabin stood. The seclusion of the spot was in Owen&rsquo;s eyes its greatest
charm. Like all men who have lived much alone, he set no common store by
the pleasures of solitude, and fancied that most if not all of his
happiness was derived from this source. At this moment his gratitude was
more than usual, as he muttered to himself, &ldquo;Thank God for it! we&rsquo;ve a
snug little place away from the sickness, and no house near us at all;&rdquo;
 and with this comforting reflection he drew near the cabin. The door,
contrary to custom at nightfall, lay open; and Owen, painfully alive to
any suspicious sign, from the state of anxiety his mind had suffered,
entered hastily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Father! where are you?&rdquo; said he quickly, not seeing the old man in his
accustomed place beside the fire; but there was no answer. Laying the
child down, Owen passed into the little chamber which served as the old
man&rsquo;s bedroom, and where now he lay stretched upon the bed in his clothes.
&ldquo;Are ye sick, father? What ails ye, father dear?&rdquo; asked the young man, as
he took his hand in his own.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad ye&rsquo;ve come at last, Owen,&rdquo; replied his father feebly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
the sickness, and am going fast.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No&mdash;no, father! don&rsquo;t be down-hearted!&rdquo; cried Owen, with a desperate
effort to suggest the courage he did not feel; for the touch of the cold
wet hand had already told him the sad secret. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a turn ye have.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, maybe so,&rdquo; said he, with a sigh; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s a cowld feeling about
my heart I never knew afore. Get me a warm drink, anyway.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
While Owen prepared some cordial from the little store he usually
dispensed among the people, his father told him, that a boy from a sick
house had called at the cabin that morning to seek for Owen, and from him,
in all likelihood, he must have caught the malady. &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said the
old man, &ldquo;that he was quite dark in the skin, and was weak in his limbs as
he walked.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ayeh!&rdquo; muttered Owen, &ldquo;av it was the &lsquo;disease&rsquo; he had, sorra bit of this
mountain he&rsquo;d ever get up. The strongest men can&rsquo;t lift a cup of wather to
their lips, when it&rsquo;s on them; but there&rsquo;s a great scarcity in the glen,
and maybe the boy eat nothing before he set out.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Although Owen&rsquo;s explanation was the correct one, it did not satisfy the
old man&rsquo;s mind, who, besides feeling convinced of his having the malady,
could not credit his taking it by other means than contagion. Owen never
quitted his side, and multiplied cares and attentions of every kind; but
it was plain the disease was gaining ground, for ere midnight the old
man&rsquo;s strength was greatly gone, and his voice sunk to a mere whisper. Yet
the malady was characterised by none of the symptoms of the prevailing
epidemic, save slight cramps, of which from time to time he complained.
His case seemed one of utter exhaustion. His mind was clear and calm; and
although unable to speak, except in short and broken sentences, no trait
of wandering intellect appeared. His malady was a common one among those
whose fears, greatly excited by the disease, usually induced symptoms of
prostration and debility, as great, if not as rapid, as those of actual
cholera. Meanwhile his thoughts were alternately turning from his own
condition to that of the people in the glen, for whom he felt the deepest
compassion. &ldquo;God help them!&rdquo; was his constant expression. &ldquo;Sickness is the
sore thing; but starvation makes it dreadful. And so Luke Clancy&rsquo;s dead!
Poor ould Luke! he was seventy-one in Michaelmas. And Martin, too! he was
a fine man.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The old man slept, or seemed to sleep, for some hours, and on waking it
was clear daylight. &ldquo;Owen, dear! I wish,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I could see the
Priest; but you mustn&rsquo;t lave me: I couldn&rsquo;t bear that now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Poor Owen&rsquo;s thoughts were that moment occupied on the same subject, and he
was torturing himself to think of any means of obtaining Father John&rsquo;s
assistance, without being obliged to go for him himself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go, and be back here in an hour&mdash;ay, or less,&rdquo; said he,
eagerly; for terrible as death was to him, the thought of seeing his
father die unanointed, was still more so.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;In an hour&mdash;where&rsquo;ll I be in an hour, Owen dear? the blessed Virgin
knows well, it wasn&rsquo;t my fault&mdash;I&rsquo;d have the Priest av I could&mdash;and
sure, Owen, you&rsquo;ll not begrudge me masses, when I&rsquo;m gone. What&rsquo;s that?
It&rsquo;s like a child crying out there.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;T&rsquo;is poor Martin&rsquo;s little boy I took home with me&mdash;he&rsquo;s lost father
and mother this day;&rdquo; and so saying, Owen hastened to see what ailed the
child. &ldquo;Yer sarvent, sir,&rdquo; said Owen, as he perceived a stout-built,
coarse-looking man, with a bull-terrier at his heels, standing in the
middle of the floor; &ldquo;Yer sarvent, sir. Who do ye want here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you Owen Connor?&rdquo; said the man, gruffly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That same,&rdquo; replied Owen, as sturdily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then this is notice for you to come up to Mr. Lucas&rsquo;s office in Galway
before the twenty-fifth, with your rent, or the receipt for it, which ever
you like best.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And who is Mr. Lucas when he&rsquo;s at home?&rdquo; said Owen, half-sneeringly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know him when you see him,&rdquo; rejoined the other, turning to leave
the cabin, as he threw a printed paper on the dresser; and then, as if
thinking he had not been formal enough in his mission, added, &ldquo;Mr. Lucas
is agent to your landlord, Mr. Leslie; and I&rsquo;ll give you a bit of advice,
keep a civil tongue in your head with him, and it will do you no harm.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This counsel, delivered much more in a tone of menace than of friendly
advice, concluded the interview, for having spoken, the fellow left the
cabin, and began to descend the mountain.
</p>
<p>
Owen&rsquo;s heart swelled fiercely&mdash;a flood of conflicting emotions were
warring within it; and as he turned to throw the paper into the fire, his
eye caught the date, 16th March. &ldquo;St. Patrick&rsquo;s Eve, the very day I saved
his life,&rdquo; said he, bitterly. &ldquo;Sure I knew well enough how it would be
when the landlord died! Well, well, if my poor ould father doesn&rsquo;t know
it, it&rsquo;s no matter.&mdash;Well, Patsy, acushla, what are ye crying for?
There, my boy, don&rsquo;t be afeard, &lsquo;tis Nony&rsquo;s with ye.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The accents so kindly uttered quieted the little fellow in a moment, and
in a few minutes after he was again asleep in the old straw chair beside
the fire. Brief as Owen&rsquo;s absence had been, the old man seemed much worse
as he entered the room. &ldquo;God forgive me, Owen darling,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but it
wasn&rsquo;t my poor sowl I was thinking of that minit. I was thinking that you
must get a letter wrote to the young landlord about this little place&mdash;I&rsquo;m
sure he&rsquo;ll never say a word about rent, no more nor his father; and as the
times wasn&rsquo;t good lately&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There, there, father,&rdquo; interrupted Owen, who felt shocked at the old
man&rsquo;s not turning his thoughts in another direction; &ldquo;never mind those
things,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;who knows which of us will be left? the sickness
doesn&rsquo;t spare the young, no more than the ould.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nor the rich, no more nor the poor,&rdquo; chimed in the old man, with a kind
of bitter satisfaction, as he thought on the landlord&rsquo;s death; for of such
incongruous motives is man made up, that calamities come lighter when they
involve the fall of those in station above our own. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a fine day,
seemingly,&rdquo; said he, suddenly changing the current of his thoughts; &ldquo;and
elegant weather for the country; we&rsquo;ll have to turn in the sheep over that
wheat; it will be too rank: ayeh,&rdquo; cried he, with a deep sigh, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not
be here to see it;&rdquo; and for once, the emotions, no dread of futurity could
awaken, were realised by worldly considerations, and the old man wept like
a child.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What time of the month is it?&rdquo; asked he, after a long interval in which
neither spoke; for Owen was not really sorry that even thus painfully the
old man&rsquo;s thoughts should be turned towards eternity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis the seventeenth, father, a holy-day all over Ireland!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is there many at the &lsquo;station?&rsquo;&mdash;look out at the door and see.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Owen ascended a little rising ground in front of the cabin, from which the
whole valley was visible; but except a group that followed a funeral upon
the road, he could see no human thing around. The green where the
&ldquo;stations&rdquo; were celebrated was totally deserted. There were neither tents
nor people; the panic of the plague had driven all ideas of revelry from
the minds of the most reckless; and, even to observe the duties of
religion, men feared to assemble in numbers. So long as the misfortune was
at a distance, they could mingle their prayers in common, and entreat for
mercy; but when death knocked at every door, the terror became almost
despair.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is the &lsquo;stations&rsquo; going on?&rdquo; asked the old man eagerly, as Owen
re-entered the room. &ldquo;Is the people at the holy well?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see many stirring at all, to-day,&rdquo; was the cautious answer; for
Owen scrupled to inflict any avoidable pain upon his mind.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lift me up, then!&rdquo; cried he suddenly, and with a voice stronger, from a
violent effort of his will. &ldquo;Lift me up to the window, till I see the
blessed cross; and maybe I&rsquo;d get a prayer among them. Come, be quick,
Owen!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Owen hastened to comply with his request; but already the old man&rsquo;s eyes
were glazed and filmy. The effort had but hastened the moment of his doom;
and, with a low faint sigh, he lay back, and died.
</p>
<p>
To the Irish peasantry, who, more than any other people of Europe, are
accustomed to bestow care and attention on the funerals of their friends
and relatives, the Cholera, in its necessity for speedy interment, was
increased in terrors tenfold. The honours which they were wont to lavish
on the dead&mdash;the ceremonial of the wake&mdash;the mingled merriment
and sorrow&mdash;the profusion with which they spent the hoarded gains of
hard-working labour&mdash;and lastly, the long train to the churchyard,
evidencing the respect entertained for the departed, should all be
foregone; for had not prudence forbid their assembling in numbers, and
thus incurring the chances of contagion, which, whether real or not, they
firmly believed in, the work of death was too widely disseminated to make
such gatherings possible. Each had some one to lament within the limits of
his own family, and private sorrow left little room for public sympathy.
No longer then was the road filled by people on horseback and foot, as the
funeral procession moved forth. The death-wail sounded no more. To chant
the <i>requiem</i> of the departed, a few&mdash;a very few&mdash;immediate
friends followed the body to the grave, in silence unbroken. Sad hearts,
indeed, they brought, and broken spirits; for in this season of pestilence
few dared to hope.
</p>
<p>
By noon, Owen was seen descending the mountain to the village, to make the
last preparations for the old man&rsquo;s funeral. He carried little Patsy in
his arms; for he could not leave the poor child alone, and in the house of
death. The claims of infancy would seem never stronger than in the heart
sorrowing over death. The grief that carries the sufferer in his mind&rsquo;s
eye over the limits of this world, is arrested by the tender ties which
bind him to life in the young. There is besides a hopefulness in early
life&mdash;it is, perhaps, its chief characteristic&mdash;that combats
sorrow, better than all the caresses of friendship, and all the
consolations of age. Owen felt this now&mdash;he never knew it before. But
yesterday, and his father&rsquo;s death had left him without one in the world on
whom to fix a hope; and already, from his misery, there arose that one
gleam, that now twinkled like a star in the sky of midnight. The little
child he had taken for his own was a world to him; and as he went, he
prayed fervently that poor Patsy might be spared to him through this
terrible pestilence.
</p>
<p>
When Owen reached the carpenter&rsquo;s, there were several people there; some,
standing moodily brooding over recent bereavements; others, spoke in low
whispers, as if fearful of disturbing the silence; but all were
sorrow-struck and sad.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How is the ould man, Owen?&rdquo; said one of a group, as he came forward.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s better off than us, I trust in God!&rdquo; said Owen, with a quivering
lip. &ldquo;He went to rest this morning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A muttered prayer from all around shewed how general was the feeling of
kindness entertained towards the Connors.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;When did he take it, Owen?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that he tuk it at all; but when I came home last night he
was lying on the bed, weak and powerless, and he slept away, with scarce a
pain, till daybreak; then&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in glory now, I pray God!&rdquo; muttered an old man with a white beard.
&ldquo;We were born in the same year, and I knew him since I was a child, like
that in your arms; and a good man he was.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Whose is the child, Owen?&rdquo; said another in the crowd.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Martin Neale&rsquo;s,&rdquo; whispered Owen; for he feared that the little fellow
might catch the words. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Miles? he looks very low
this morning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This question referred to a large powerful-looking man, who, with a
smith&rsquo;s apron twisted round his waist, sat without speaking in a corner of
the shop.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afeard he&rsquo;s in a bad way,&rdquo; whispered the man to whom he spoke. &ldquo;There
was a process-server, or a bailiff, or something of the kind, serving
notices through the townland yesterday, and he lost a shoe off his baste,
and would have Miles out, to put it on, tho&rsquo; we all tould him that he
buried his daughter&mdash;a fine grown girl&mdash;that mornin&rsquo;. And what
does the fellow do, but goes and knocks at the forge till Miles comes out.
You know Miles Regan, so I needn&rsquo;t say there wasn&rsquo;t many words passed
between them. In less nor two minutes&mdash;whatever the bailiff said&mdash;Miles
tuck him by the throat, and pulled him down from the horse, and dragged
him along to the lake, and flung him in. &lsquo;Twas the Lord&rsquo;s marcy he knew
how to swim; but we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;ll be done to Miles yet, for he was
the new agent&rsquo;s man.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Was he a big fellow, with a bull-dog following him?&rdquo; asked Owen.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; that&rsquo;s another; sure there&rsquo;s three or four of them goin&rsquo; about. We
hear, that bad as ould French was, the new one is worse.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s the will of God!&rdquo; said Owen, in that tone of voice
which bespoke a willingness for all endurance, so long as the consolation
remained, that the ill was not unrecorded above; while he felt that all
the evils of poverty were little in comparison with the loss of those
nearest and dearest. &ldquo;Come, Patsy, my boy!&rdquo; said he at last, as he placed
the coffin in the ass-cart, and turned towards the mountain; and, leading
the little fellow by the hand, he set out on his way&mdash;&ldquo;Come home.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was not until he arrived at that part of the road from which the cabin
was visible, that Owen knew the whole extent of his bereavement; then,
when he looked up and saw the door hasped on the outside, and the chimney
from which no smoke ascended, the full measure of his lone condition came
at once before him, and he bent over the coffin and wept bitterly. All the
old man&rsquo;s affection for him, his kind indulgence and forbearance, his
happy nature, his simple-heartedness, gushed forth from his memory, and he
wondered why he had not loved his father, in life, a thousand times more,
so deeply was he now penetrated by his loss. If this theme did not assuage
his sorrows, it at least so moulded his heart as to bear them in a better
spirit; and when, having placed the body in the coffin, he knelt down
beside it to pray, it was in a calmer and more submissive frame of mind
than he had yet known.
</p>
<p>
It was late in the afternoon ere Owen was once more on the road down the
mountain; for it was necessary&mdash;or at least believed so&mdash;that
the internment should take place on the day of death.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I never thought it would be this way you&rsquo;d go to your last home, father
dear,&rdquo; said Owen aloud and in a voice almost stifled with sobs; for the
absence of all his friends and relatives at such a moment, now smote on
the poor fellow&rsquo;s heart, as he walked beside the little cart on which the
coffin was laid. It was indeed a sight to move a sterner nature than his:
the coffin, not reverently carried by bearers, and followed by its long
train of mourners, but laid slant-wise in the cart, the spade and shovel
to dig the grave beside it, and Patsy seated on the back of the ass,
watching with infant glee the motion of the animal, as with careful foot
he descended the rugged mountain. Poor child! how your guileless laughter
shook that strong man&rsquo;s heart with agony!
</p>
<p>

</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">

</div>
<p>
It was a long and weary way to the old churchyard. The narrow road, too,
was deeply rutted and worn by wheel-tracks; for, alas, it had been trodden
by many, of late. The grey daylight was fast fading as Owen pushed wide
the old gate and entered. What a change to his eyes did the aspect of the
place present! The green mounds of earth which marked the resting-place of
village patriarchs, were gone; and heaps of fresh-turned clay were seen on
every side, no longer decorated, as of old, with little emblems of
affectionate sorrow; no tree, nor stone, not even a wild flower, spoke of
the regrets of those who remained. The graves were rudely fashioned, as if
in haste&mdash;for so it was&mdash;few dared to linger there!
</p>
<p>
Seeking out a lone spot near the ruins, Owen began to dig the grave, while
the little child, in mute astonishment at all he saw, looked on.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t you stay out in the road, Patsy, and play there, till I come
to you? This is a cowld damp place for you, my boy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nony! Nony!&rdquo; cried the child, looking at him with an affectionate smile,
as though to say he&rsquo;d rather be near him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, who knows but you&rsquo;re right? if it&rsquo;s the will of God to take
me, maybe you might as well go too. It&rsquo;s a sore thing to be alone in the
world, like me now!&rdquo; And as he muttered the last few words he ceased
digging, and rested his head on the cross of the spade.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Was that you, Patsy? I heard a voice somewhere.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The child shook his head in token of dissent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ayeh! it was only the wind through the ould walls; but sure it might be
nat&rsquo;ral enough for sighs and sobs to be here: there&rsquo;s many a one has
floated over this damp clay.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He resumed his work once more. The night was falling fast as Owen stepped
from the deep grave, and knelt down to say a prayer ere he committed the
body to the earth.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Kneel down, darlin&rsquo;, here by my side,&rdquo; said he, placing his arm round the
little fellow&rsquo;s waist; &ldquo;&lsquo;tis the likes of you God loves best;&rdquo; and joining
the tiny hands with his own, he uttered a deep and fervent prayer for the
soul of the departed. &ldquo;There, father!&rdquo; said he, as he arose at last, and
in a voice as if addressing a living person at his side; &ldquo;there, father:
the Lord, he knows my heart inside me; and if walking the world barefoot
would give ye peace or ease, I&rsquo;d do it, for you were a kind man and a good
father to me.&rdquo; He kissed the coffin as he spoke, and stood silently gazing
on it.
</p>
<p>
Arousing himself with a kind of struggle, he untied the cords, and lifted
the coffin from the cart. For some seconds he busied himself in arranging
the ropes beneath it, and then ceased suddenly, on remembering that he
could not lower it into the grave unassisted.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to go down the road for some one,&rdquo; muttered he to himself; but
as he said this, he perceived at some distance off in the churchyard the
figure of a man, as if kneeling over a grave. &ldquo;The Lord help him, he has
his grief too!&rdquo; ejaculated Owen, as he moved towards him. On coming nearer
he perceived that the grave was newly made, and from its size evidently
that of a child.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I ax your pardon,&rdquo; said Owen, in a timid voice, after waiting for several
minutes in the vain expectation that the man would look up; &ldquo;I ax your
pardon for disturbing you, but maybe you&rsquo;ll be kind enough to help me to
lay this coffin in the ground. I have nobody with me but a child.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The man started and looked round. Their eyes met; it was Phil Joyce and
Owen who now confronted each other. But how unlike were both to what they
were at their last parting! Then, vindictive passion, outraged pride, and
vengeance, swelled every feature and tingled in every fibre of their
frames. Now, each stood pale, care-worn, and dispirited, wearied out by
sorrow, and almost brokenhearted. Owen was the first to speak.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I axed your pardon before I saw you, Phil Joyce, and I ax it again now,
for disturbing you; but I didn&rsquo;t know you, and I wanted to put my poor
father&rsquo;s body in the grave.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know he was dead,&rdquo; said Phil, in a hollow voice, like one
speaking to himself. &ldquo;This is poor little Billy here,&rdquo; and he pointed to
the mound at his feet.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The heavens be his bed this night!&rdquo; said Owen, piously; &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; and
he turned to go away; then stopping suddenly, he added, &ldquo;Maybe, after all,
you&rsquo;ll not refuse me, and the Lord might be more merciful to us both, than
if we were to part like enemies.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Owen Connor, I ask your forgiveness,&rdquo; said Phil, stretching forth his
hand, while his voice trembled like a sick child&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think the
day would come I&rsquo;d ever do it; but my heart is humble enough now, and
maybe &lsquo;twill be lower soon. Will you take my hand?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will I, Phil? will I, is it? ay, and however ye may change to me after
this night, I&rsquo;ll never forget this.&rdquo; And he grasped the cold fingers in
both hands, and pressed them ardently, and the two men fell into each
other&rsquo;s arms and wept.
</p>
<p>
Is it a proud or a humiliating confession for humanity&mdash;assuredly it
is a true one&mdash;that the finest and best traits of our nature are
elicited in our troubles, and not in our joys? that we come out purer
through trials than prosperity? Does the chastisement of Heaven teach us
better than the blessings lavished upon us? or are these gifts the
compensation sent us for our afflictions, that when poorest before man we
should be richest before God? Few hearts there are which sorrow makes not
wiser&mdash;none which are not better for it. So it was here. These men,
in the continuance of good fortune, had been enemies for life; mutual
hatred had grown up between them, so that each yearned for vengeance on
the other; and now they walked like brothers, only seeking forgiveness of
each other, and asking pardon for the past.
</p>
<p>
The old man was laid in his grave, and they turned to leave the
churchyard.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t ye come home with me, Owen?&rdquo; said Phil, as they came to where their
roads separated; &ldquo;won&rsquo;t ye come and eat your supper with us?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Owen&rsquo;s throat filled up: he could only mutter, &ldquo;Not to-night, Phil&mdash;another
time, plaze God.&rdquo; He had not ventured even to ask for Mary, nor did he
know whether Phil Joyce in his reconciliation might wish a renewal of any
intimacy with his sister. Such was the reason of Owen&rsquo;s refusal; for,
however strange it may seem to some, there is a delicacy of the heart as
well as of good breeding, and one advantage it possesses&mdash;it is of
all lands, and the fashion never changes.
</p>
<p>
Poor Owen would have shed his best blood to be able to ask after Mary&mdash;to
learn how she was, and how she bore up under the disasters of the time;
but he never mentioned her name: and as for Phil Joyce, his gloomy
thoughts had left no room for others, and he parted from Owen without a
single allusion to her. &ldquo;Good night, Owen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t forget
your promise to come and see us soon.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good night, Phil,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;and I pray a blessing on you and
yours.&rdquo; A slight quivering of the voice at the last word was all he
suffered to escape him; and they parted.

<h2>
THIRD ERA
</h2>
<p>
From that day, the pestilence began to abate in violence. The cases of
disease became fewer and less fatal; and at last, like a spent bolt, the
malady ceased to work its mischief. Men were slow enough to recognise this
bettered aspect of their fortune. Calamity had weighed too heavily on them
to make them rally at once. They still walked like those who felt the
shadow of death upon them, and were fearful lest any imprudent act or word
might bring back the plague among them.
</p>
<p>
With time, however, these features passed off: people gradually resumed
their wonted habits; and, except where the work of death had been more
than ordinarily destructive, the malady was now treated as &ldquo;a thing that
had been.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
If Owen Connor had not escaped the common misfortune of the land, he could
at least date one happy event from that sad period&mdash;his
reconciliation with Phil Joyce. This was no passing friendship. The
dreadful scenes he had witnessed about him had made Phil an altered
character. The devotion of Owen&mdash;his manly indifference to personal
risk whenever his services were wanted by another&mdash;his unsparing
benevolence,&mdash;all these traits, the mention of which at first only
irritated and vexed his soul, were now remembered in the day of
reconciliation; and none felt prouder to acknowledge his friendship than
his former enemy.
</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding all this, Owen did not dare to found a hope upon his
change of fortune; for Mary was even more distant and cold to him than
ever, as though to shew that, whatever expectations he might conceive from
her brother&rsquo;s friendship, he should not reckon too confidently on her
feelings. Owen knew not how far he had himself to blame for this; he was
not aware that his own constrained manner, his over-acted reserve, had
offended Mary to the quick; and thus, both mutually retreated in
misconception and distrust. The game of love is the same, whether the
players be clad in velvet or in hodden grey. Beneath the gilded ceilings
of a palace, or the lowly rafters of a cabin, there are the same hopes and
fears, the same jealousies, and distrusts, and despondings; the wiles and
stratagems are all alike; for, after all, the stake is human happiness,
whether he who risks it be a peer or a peasant! While Owen vacillated
between hope and fear, now, resolving to hazard an avowal of his love and
take his stand on the result, now, deeming it better to trust to time and
longer intimacy, other events were happening around, which could not fail
to interest him deeply. The new agent had commenced his campaign with an
activity before unknown. Arrears of rent were demanded to be peremptorily
paid up; leases, whose exact conditions had not been fulfilled, were
declared void; tenants occupying sub-let land were noticed to quit; and
all the threatening signs of that rigid management displayed, by which an
estate is assumed to be &ldquo;admirably regulated,&rdquo; and the agent&rsquo;s duty most
creditably discharged.
</p>
<p>
Many of the arrears were concessions made by the landlord in seasons of
hardship and distress, but were unrecorded as such in the rent-roll or the
tenant&rsquo;s receipt. There had been no intention of ever redemanding them;
and both parties had lost sight of the transaction until the sharp glance
of a &ldquo;new agent&rdquo; discovered their existence. So of the leases: covenants
to build, or plant, or drain, were inserted rather as contingencies, which
prosperity might empower, than as actual conditions essential to be
fulfilled; and as for sub-letting, it was simply the act by which a son or
a daughter was portioned in the world, and enabled to commence the work of
self-maintenance.
</p>
<p>
This slovenly system inflicted many evils. The demand of an extravagant
rent rendered an abatement not a boon, but an act of imperative necessity;
and while the overhanging debt supplied the landlord with a means of
tyranny, it deprived the tenant of all desire to improve his condition.
&ldquo;Why should I labour,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when the benefit never can be mine?&rdquo; The
landlord then declaimed against ingratitude, at the time that the peasant
spoke against oppression. Could they both be right? The impossibility of
ever becoming independent soon suggested that dogged indifference, too
often confounded with indolent habits. Sustenance was enough for him, who,
if he earned more, should surrender it; hence the poor man became chained
to his poverty. It was a weight which grew with his strength; privations
might as well be incurred with little labour as with great; and he sunk
down to the condition of a mere drudge, careless and despondent. &ldquo;He can
only take all I have!&rdquo; was the cottier&rsquo;s philosophy; and the maxim
suggested a corollary, that the &ldquo;all&rdquo; should be as little as might be.
</p>
<p>
But there were other grievances flowing from this source. The extent of
these abatements usually depended on the representation of the tenants
themselves, and such evidences as they could produce of their poverty and
destitution. Hence a whole world of falsehood and dissimulation was
fostered. Cabins were suffered to stand half-roofed; children left to
shiver in rags and nakedness; age and infirmity exhibited in attitudes of
afflicting privation; habits of mendicity encouraged;&mdash;all, that they
might impose upon the proprietor, and make him believe that any sum wrung
from such as these must be an act of cruelty. If these schemes were
sometimes successful, so in their failure they fell as heavy penalties
upon the really destitute, for whose privations no pity was felt. Their
misery, confounded in the general mass of dissimulation, was neglected;
and for one who prospered in his falsehood, many were visited in their
affliction.
</p>
<p>
That men in such circumstances as these should listen with greedy ears to
any representation which reflected heavily on their wealthier neighbours,
is little to be wondered at. The triumph of knavery and falsehood is a bad
lesson for any people; but the fruitlessness of honest industry is, if
possible, a worse one. Both were well taught by this system. And these
things took place, not, be it observed, when the landlord or his agent
were cruel and exacting&mdash;very far from it. They were the instances so
popularly expatiated on by newspapers and journals; they were the cases
headed&mdash;&ldquo;Example for Landlords!&rdquo; &ldquo;Timely Benevolence!&rdquo; and
paragraphed thus:&mdash;&ldquo;We learn, with the greatest pleasure, that Mr.
Muldrennin, of Kilbally-drennin, has, in consideration of the failure of
the potato-crop, and the severe pressure of the season, kindly abated five
per cent of all his rents. Let this admirable example be generally
followed, and we shall once more see,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c. There was no
explanatory note to state the actual condition of that tenantry, or the
amount of that rent from which the deduction was made. Mr. Muldrennin was
then free to run his career of active puffery throughout the kingdom, and
his tenantry to starve on as before.
</p>
<p>
Of all worldly judgments there is one that never fails. No man was ever
instrumental, either actively or through neglect, to another&rsquo;s
demoralisation, that he was not made to feel the recoil of his conduct on
himself. Such had been palpably the result here. The confidence of the
people lost, they had taken to themselves the only advisers in their
power, and taught themselves to suppose that relief can only be effected
by legislative enactments, or their own efforts. This lesson once learned,
and they were politicians for life. The consequence has been, isolation
from him to whom once all respect and attachment were rendered; distrust
and dislike follow&mdash;would that the catalogue went no further!
</p>
<p>
And again to our story. Owen was at last reminded, by the conversation of
those about, that he too had received a summons from the new agent to
attend at his office in Galway&mdash;a visit which, somehow or other, he
had at first totally neglected; and, as the summons was not repeated, he
finally supposed had been withdrawn by the agent, on learning the
condition of his holding. As September drew to a close, however, he
accompanied Phil Joyce on his way to Galway, prepared, if need be, to pay
the half-year&rsquo;s rent, but ardently hoping the while it might never be
demanded. It was a happy morning for poor Owen&mdash;the happiest of his
whole life. He had gone over early to breakfast at Joyce&rsquo;s, and on
reaching the house found Mary alone, getting ready the meal. Their usual
distance in manner continued for some time; each talked of what their
thoughts were least occupied on; and at last, after many a look from the
window to see if Phil was coming, and wondering why he did not arrive,
Owen drew a heavy sigh and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Mary; divil a longer I can
be suffering this way; take me or refuse me you must this morning! I know
well enough you don&rsquo;t care for me; but if ye don&rsquo;t like any one else
better, who knows but in time, and with God&rsquo;s blessin&rsquo;, but ye&rsquo;ll be as
fond of me, as I am of you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And who told ye I didn&rsquo;t like some one else?&rdquo; said Mary, with a sly
glance; and her handsome features brightened up with a more than common
brilliancy.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The heavens make him good enough to desarve ye, I pray this day!&rdquo; said
Owen, with a trembling lip. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go now! that&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t ye wait for yer breakfast, Owen Connor? Won&rsquo;t ye stay a bit for my
brother?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, thank ye, ma&rsquo;am. I&rsquo;ll not go into Galway to-day.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, but don&rsquo;t go without your breakfast. Take a cup of tay anyhow, Owen
dear!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Owen dear! O Mary, jewel! don&rsquo;t say them words, and I laving you for
ever.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The young girl blushed deeply and turned away her head, but her crimsoned
neck shewed that her shame was not departed. At the moment, Phil burst
into the room, and standing for a second with his eyes fixed on each in
turn, he said, &ldquo;Bad scran to ye, for women; but there&rsquo;s nothing but decate
and wickedness in ye; divil a peace or ease I ever got when I quarrelled
with Owen, and now that we&rsquo;re friends, ye&rsquo;re as cross and discontented as
ever. Try what you can do with her yourself, Owen, my boy; for I give her
up.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis not for me to thry it,&rdquo; said Owen, despondingly; &ldquo;&lsquo;tis another has
the betther luck.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true, anyhow,&rdquo; cried Phil; &ldquo;for she told me so herself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What! Mary, did ye say that?&rdquo; said Owen, with a spring across the room;
&ldquo;did ye tell him that, darling?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sure if I did, ye wouldn&rsquo;t believe me,&rdquo; said Mary, with a side-look;
&ldquo;women is nothing but deceit and wickedness.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sorra else,&rdquo; cried Owen, throwing his arm round her neck and kissing her;
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll never believe ye again, when ye say ye don&rsquo;t love me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a nice way to boil the eggs hard,&rdquo; said Phil, testily; &ldquo;arrah, come
over here and eat your breakfast, man; you&rsquo;ll have time enough for
courting when we come back.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>

</div>
<p>
There needed not many words to a bargain which was already ratified; and
before they left the house, the day of the wedding was actually fixed.
</p>
<p>
It was not without reason, then, that I said it was a happy day for Owen.
Never did the long miles of the road seem so short as now; while, with
many a plan for the future, and many a day-dream of happiness to come, he
went at Phil&rsquo;s side scarce crediting his good fortune to be real.
</p>
<p>
When they arrived at the agent&rsquo;s office in the square at Galway, they
found a great many of their neighbours and friends already there; some,
moody and depressed, yet lingered about the door, though they had
apparently finished the business which brought them; others,
anxious-looking and troubled, were waiting for their turn to enter. They
were all gathered into little groups and parties, conversing eagerly
together in Irish; and as each came out of the office, he was speedily
surrounded by several others, questioning him as to how he had fared, and
what success he met with.
</p>
<p>
Few came forth satisfied&mdash;not one happy-looking. Some, who were
deficient a few shillings, were sent back again, and appeared with the
money still in their hands, which they counted over and over, as if hoping
to make it more. Others, trusting to promptitude in their payments, were
seeking renewal of their tenures at the same rent, and found their
requests coldly received, and no pledge returned. Others, again, met with
severe reproaches as to the condition of their dwellings and the neglected
appearance of their farms, with significant hints that slovenly tenants
would meet with little favour, and, although pleading sickness and
distress, found the apology hut slightly regarded.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We thought the ould agent bad enough; but, faix, this one bates him out,
entirely.&rdquo; Such was the comment of each and all, at the treatment met
with, and such the general testimony of the crowd.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Owen Connor! Owen Connor!&rdquo; called out a voice, which Owen in a moment
recognised as that of the fellow who had visited his cabin; and passing
through the densely crowded hall, Owen forced his way into the small front
parlour, where two clerks were seated at a table, writing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Over here; this way, if you please,&rdquo; said one of them, pointing with his
pen to the place he should stand in. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Owen Connor, sir.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of your holding?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ballydorery, Knockshaughlin, and Cushaglin, is the townlands, and the
mountain is Slieve-na-vick, sir.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Owen Connor, Owen Connor,&rdquo; said the clerk, repeating the name three or
four times over. &ldquo;Oh, I remember; there has been no rent paid on your farm
for some years.&lsquo;&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right there, sir,&rdquo; said Owen; &ldquo;the landlord, God be good to him!
tould my poor father&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, I have nothing to do with that&mdash;step inside&mdash;Mr.
Lucas will speak to you himself;&mdash;shew this man inside, Luffey;&rdquo; and
the grim bailiff led the way into the back parlour, where two gentlemen
were standing with their backs to the fire, chatting; they were both young
and good-looking, and, to Owen&rsquo;s eyes, as unlike agents as could be. .
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, what does this honest fellow want?&mdash;no abatement, I hope; a
fellow with as good a coat as you have, can&rsquo;t be very ill off.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;True for you, yer honor, and I am not,&rdquo; said Owen in reply to the
speaker, who seemed a few years younger than the other. &ldquo;<i>I</i> was bid
spake to yer honor about the little place I have up the mountains, and
that Mr. Leslie gave my father rent-free&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you are the man from Maam, an&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The same, sir; Owen Connor.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the mountain I told you of, Major,&rdquo; said Lucas in a whisper; then,
turning to Owen, resumed: &ldquo;Well, I wished to see you very much, and speak
to you. I&rsquo;ve heard the story about your getting the land rent-free, and
all that; but I find no mention of the matter in the books of the estate;
there is not the slightest note nor memorandum that I can see, on the
subject; and except your own word&mdash;which of course, as far as it
goes, is all very well&mdash;I have nothing in your favour.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
While these words were being spoken, Owen went through a thousand
tortures; and many a deep conflicting passion warred within him. &ldquo;Well,
sir,&rdquo; said he at last, with a heavily drawn sigh, &ldquo;well, sir, with God&rsquo;s
blessin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ll do my best; and whatever your honour says is fair, I&rsquo;ll
thry and pay it: I suppose I&rsquo;m undher rent since March last?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;March! why, my good fellow, there&rsquo;s six years due last twenty-fifth; what
are you thinking of?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sure you don&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m to pay, for what was given to me and my father?&rdquo;
 said Owen, with a wild look that almost startled the agent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I mean precisely what I say,&rdquo; said Lucas, reddening with anger at the
tone Owen assumed. &ldquo;I mean that you owe six years and a half of rent; for
which, if you neither produce receipt nor money, you&rsquo;ll never owe another
half year for the same holding.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s flat!&rdquo; said the Major, laughing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s flat!&rdquo; echoed Lucas, joining in the mirth.
</p>
<p>
Owen looked from one to the other of the speakers, and although never
indisposed to enjoy a jest, he could not, for the life of him, conceive
what possible occasion for merriment existed at the present moment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Plenty of grouse on that mountain, an&rsquo;t there?&rdquo; said the Major, tapping
his boot with his cane.
</p>
<p>
But, although the question was addressed to Owen, he was too deeply sunk
in his own sad musings to pay it any attention.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear, my good fellow? Major Lynedoch asks, if there are not
plenty of grouse on the mountain.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did the present landlord say that I was to pay this back rent?&rdquo; said Owen
deliberately, after a moment of deep thought.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Leslie never gave me any particular instructions on your account,&rdquo;
 said Lucas smiling; &ldquo;nor do I suppose that his intentions regarding you
are different from those respecting other tenants.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0013" id="linkimage-0013">

</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/pat0144.jpg" width="100%" alt="144 " />
</div>
<p>
&ldquo;I saved his life, then!&rdquo; said Owen; and his eyes flashed with indignation
as he spoke.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you saved a devilish good fellow, I can tell you,&rdquo; said the Major,
smiling complacently, as though to hint that the act was a very sufficient
reward for its own performance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The sorra much chance he had of coming to the property that day, anyhow,
till I came up,&rdquo; said Owen, in a half soliloquy.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What! were the savages about to scalp him? Eh!&rdquo; asked the Major.
</p>
<p>
Owen turned a scowl towards him that stopped the already-begun laugh;
while Lucas, amazed at the peasant&rsquo;s effrontery, said, &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t wait
any longer, my good fellow; I have nothing more to say.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was going to ask yer honner, sir,&rdquo; said Owen, civilly, &ldquo;if I paid the
last half-year&mdash;I have it with me&mdash;if ye&rsquo;ll let me stay in the
place till ye&rsquo;ll ask Mr. Leslie&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But you forget, my friend, that a receipt for the last half-year is a
receipt in full,&rdquo; said Lucas, interrupting.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sure; I don&rsquo;t want the receipt!&rdquo; said Owen hurriedly; &ldquo;keep it yourself.
It isn&rsquo;t mistrusting the word of a gentleman I&rsquo;d be.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Eh, Lucas! blarney! I say, blarney, and no mistake!&rdquo; cried the Major,
half-suffocated with his own drollery.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;By my sowl! it&rsquo;s little blarney I&rsquo;d give you, av I had ye at the side of
Slieve-na-vick,&rdquo; said Owen; and the look he threw towards him left little
doubt of his sincerity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Leave the room, sir! leave the room!&rdquo; said Lucas, with a gesture towards
the door.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dare I ax you where Mr. Leslie is now, sir?&rdquo; said Owen, calmly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in London: No. 18 Belgrave Square.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Would yer honour be so kind as to write it on a bit of paper for me?&rdquo;
 said Owen, almost obsequiously.
</p>
<p>
Lucas sat down and wrote the address upon a card, handing it to Owen
without a word.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I humbly ax yer pardon, gentlemen, if I was rude to either of ye,&rdquo; said
Owen, with a bow, as he moved towards the door; &ldquo;but distress of mind
doesn&rsquo;t improve a man&rsquo;s manners, if even he had more nor I have; but if I
get the little place yet, and that ye care for a day&rsquo;s sport&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Eh, damme, you&rsquo;re not so bad, after all,&rdquo; said the Major: &ldquo;I say, Lucas&mdash;is
he, now?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your servant, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Owen, who felt too indignant at the cool
insolence with which his generous proposal was accepted, to trust himself
with more; and with that, he left the room.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, Owen, my boy,&rdquo; said Phil, who long since having paid his own rent,
was becoming impatient at his friend&rsquo;s absence; &ldquo;well, Owen, ye might have
settled about the whole estate by this time. Why did they keep you so
long?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In a voice tremulous with agitation, Owen repeated the result of his
interview, adding, as he concluded, &ldquo;And now, there&rsquo;s nothing for it,
Phil, but to see the landlord himself, and spake to him. I&rsquo;ve got the name
of the place he&rsquo;s in, here&mdash;it&rsquo;s somewhere in London; and I&rsquo;ll never
turn my steps to home, before I get a sight of him. I&rsquo;ve the half-year&rsquo;s
rent here in my pocket, so that I&rsquo;ll have money enough, and to spare; and
I only ax ye, Phil, to tell Mary how the whole case is, and to take care
of little Patsy for me till I come back&mdash;he&rsquo;s at your house now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never fear, we&rsquo;ll take care of him, Owen; and I believe you&rsquo;re doing the
best thing, after all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The two friends passed the evening together, at least until the time
arrived, when Owen took his departure by the mail. It was a sad
termination to a day which opened so joyfully, and not all Phil&rsquo;s
endeavours to rally and encourage his friend could dispossess Owen&rsquo;s mind
of a gloomy foreboding that it was but the beginning of misfortune. &ldquo;I
have it over me,&rdquo; was his constant expression as they talked; &ldquo;I have it
over me, that something bad will come out of this;&rdquo; and although his fears
were vague and indescribable, they darkened his thoughts as effectually as
real evils.
</p>
<p>
The last moment came, and Phil, with a hearty &lsquo;&ldquo;God speed you,&rdquo; shook his
friend&rsquo;s hand, and he was gone.
</p>
<p>
It would but protract my story, without fulfilling any of its objects, to
speak of Owen&rsquo;s journey to England and on to London. It was a season of
great distress in the manufacturing districts; several large failures had
occurred&mdash;great stagnation of trade existed, and a general depression
was observable over the population of the great trading cities. There were
daily meetings to consider the condition of the working classes, and the
newspapers were crammed with speeches and resolutions in their favour.
Placards were carried about the streets, with terrible announcements of
distress and privation, and processions of wretched-looking men were met
with on every side.
</p>
<p>
Owen, who, from motives of economy, prosecuted his journey on foot, had
frequent opportunities of entering the dwellings of the poor, and
observing their habits and modes of life. The everlasting complaints of
suffering and want rung in his ears from morning till night; and yet, to
his unaccustomed eyes, the evidences betrayed few, if any, of the evils of
great poverty. The majority were not without bread&mdash;the very poorest
had a sufficiency of potatoes. Their dwellings were neat-looking and
comfortable, and, in comparison with what he was used to, actually
luxurious. Neither were their clothes like the ragged and tattered
coverings Owen had seen at home. The fustian jackets of the men were
generally whole and well cared for; but the children more than all struck
him. In Ireland, the young are usually the first to feel the pressure of
hardship&mdash;their scanty clothing rather the requirement of decency,
than a protection against weather: here, the children were cleanly and
comfortably dressed&mdash;none were in rags, few without shoes and
stockings.
</p>
<p>
What could such people mean by talking of distress, Owen could by no means
comprehend. &ldquo;I wish we had a little of this kind of poverty in ould
Ireland!&rdquo; was the constant theme of his thoughts. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis little they know
what distress is! Faix, I wondher what they&rsquo;d say if they saw Connemarra?&rdquo;
 And yet, the privations they endured were such as had not been known for
many years previous. Their sufferings were really great, and the interval
between their ordinary habits as wide, as ever presented itself in the
fortunes of the poor Irishman&rsquo;s life. But poverty, after all, is merely
relative; and they felt that as &ldquo;starvation&rdquo; which Paddy would hail as a
season of blessing and abundance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;With a fine slated house over them, and plenty of furniture inside, and
warm clothes, and enough to eat,&mdash;that&rsquo;s what they call distress!
Musha! I&rsquo;d like to see them, when they think they&rsquo;re comfortable,&rdquo; thought
Owen, who at last lost all patience with such undeserved complainings, and
could with difficulty restrain himself from an open attack on their
injustice.
</p>
<p>
He arrived in London at last, and the same evening hastened to Belgrave
Square; for his thoughts were now, as his journey drew to a close,
painfully excited at the near prospect of seeing his landlord. He found
the house without difficulty: it was a splendid town-mansion, well
befitting a man of large fortune; and Owen experienced an Irishman&rsquo;s
gratification in the spacious and handsome building he saw before him. He
knocked, at first timidly, and then, as no answer was returned, more
boldly; but it was not before a third summons that the door was opened;
and an old mean-looking woman asked him what he wanted.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I want to see the masther, ma&rsquo;am, av it&rsquo;s plazing to ye!&rdquo; said Owen,
leaning against the door-jamb as he spoke.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The master? What do you mean?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Leslie himself, the landlord.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Leslie is abroad&mdash;in Italy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Abroad! abroad!&rdquo; echoed Owen, while a sickly faint-ness spread itself
through his frame. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not out of England, is he?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you he&rsquo;s in Italy, my good man.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Erra! where&rsquo;s that at all?&rdquo; cried Owen, despairingly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know; but I can give you the address, if you want it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, thank ye, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;it&rsquo;s too late for that, now,&rdquo; said he. The old
woman closed the door, and the poor fellow sat down upon the steps,
overcome by this sad and unlooked-for result.
</p>
<p>
It was evening. The streets were crowded with people,&mdash;some on foot,
some on horseback and in carriages. The glare of splendid equipages, the
glittering of wealth&mdash;the great human tide rolled past, unnoticed by
Owen, for his own sorrows filled his whole heart.
</p>
<p>
Men in all their worldliness,&mdash;some, on errands of pleasure, some,
care-worn and thoughtful, some, brimful of expectation, and others,
downcast and dejected, moved past: scarcely one remarked that poor
peasant, whose travelled and tired look, equally with his humble dress,
bespoke one who came from afar.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, God help me, what&rsquo;s best for me to do now?&rdquo; said Owen Connor, as he
sat ruminating on his fortune; and, unable to find any answer to his own
question, he arose and walked slowly along, not knowing nor caring
whither.
</p>
<p>
There is no such desolation as that of a large and crowded city to him,
who, friendless and alone, finds himself a wanderer within its walls. The
man of education and taste looks around him for objects of interest or
amusement, yet saddened by the thought that he is cut off from all
intercourse with his fellow-men; but, to the poor unlettered stranger, how
doubly depressing are all these things! Far from speculating on the wealth
and prosperity around him, he feels crushed and humiliated in its
presence. His own humble condition appears even more lowly in contrast
with such evidences of splendour; and instinctively he retreats from the
regions where fashion, and rank, and riches abound, to the gloomy abodes
of less-favoured fortunes.
</p>
<p>
When Owen awoke the following morning, and looked about him in the humble
lodging he had selected, he could scarcely believe that already the end of
his long journey had been met by failure. Again and again he endeavoured
to remember if he had seen his landlord, and what reply he had received;
but except a vague sense of disappointment, he could fix on nothing. It
was only as he drew near the great mansion once more, that he could
thoroughly recollect all that had happened; and then, the truth flashed on
his mind, and he felt all the bitterness of his misfortune. I need not
dwell on this theme. The poor man turned again homeward; why, he could not
well have answered, had any been cruel enough to ask him. The hope that
buoyed him up before, now spent and exhausted, his step was slow and his
heart heavy, while his mind, racked with anxieties and dreads, increased
his bodily debility, and made each mile of the way seem ten.
</p>
<p>
On the fourth day of his journey&mdash;wet through from morning till late
in the evening&mdash;he was seized with a shivering-fit, followed soon
after by symptoms of fever. The people in whose house he had taken shelter
for the night, had him at once conveyed to the infirmary, where for eight
weeks he lay dangerously ill; a relapse of his malady, on the day before
he was to be pronounced convalescent, occurred, and the third month was
nigh its close, ere Owen left the hospital.
</p>
<p>
It was more than a week ere he could proceed on his journey, which he did
at last, moving only a few miles each day, and halting before nightfall.
Thus wearily plodding on, he reached Liverpool at last, and about the
middle of January arrived in his native country once more.
</p>
<p>
His strength regained, his bodily vigour restored, he had made a long
day&rsquo;s journey to reach home, and it was about ten o&rsquo;clock of a bright and
starry night that he crossed the mountains that lie between Ballinrobe and
Maam. To Owen, the separation from his home seemed like a thing of years
long; and his heart was full to bursting as each well-remembered spot
appeared, bringing back a thousand associations of his former life. As he
strode along he stopped frequently to look down towards the village,
where, in each light that twinkled, he could mark the different cabins of
his old friends. At length, the long low farmhouse of the Joyces came into
view&mdash;he could trace it by the line of light that glittered from
every window&mdash;and from this, Owen could not easily tear himself away.
Muttering a heartfelt prayer for those beneath that roof, he at last moved
on, and near midnight gained the little glen where his cabin stood.
Scarcely, however, had he reached the spot, when the fierce challenge of a
dog attracted him. It was not his own poor colley&mdash;he knew his voice
well&mdash;and Owen&rsquo;s blood ran chilly at the sound of that strange bark.
He walked on, however, resolutely grasping his stick in his hand, and
suddenly, as he turned the angle of the cliff, there stood his cabin, with
a light gleaming from the little window.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis Phil Joyce maybe has put somebody in, to take care of the place,&rdquo;
 said he; but his fears gave no credence to the surmise.
</p>
<p>
Again the dog challenged, and at the same moment the door was opened, and
a man&rsquo;s voice called out, &ldquo;Who comes there?&rdquo; The glare of the fire at his
back shewed that he held a musket in his hand.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis me, Owen Connor,&rdquo; answered Owen, half sulkily, for he felt that
indescribable annoyance a man will experience at any question, as to his
approaching his own dwelling, even though in incognito.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stay back, then,&rdquo; cried the other; &ldquo;if you advance another step, I&rsquo;ll
send a bullet through you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Send a bullet through me!&rdquo; cried Owen, scornfully, yet even more
astonished than indignant. &ldquo;Why, isn&rsquo;t a man to be let go to his own
house, without being fired at?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be as good as my word,&rdquo; said the fellow; and as he spoke, Owen saw
him lift the gun to his shoulder and steadily hold it there. &ldquo;Move one
step now, and you&rsquo;ll see if I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Owen&rsquo;s first impulse was to rush forward at any hazard, and if not
wounded, to grapple with his adversary; but he reflected for a second that
some great change must have occurred in his absence, which, in all
likelihood, no act of daring on his part could avert or alter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait
for morning, anyhow,&rdquo; thought he; and without another word, or deigning
any answer to the other, he slowly turned, and retraced his steps down the
mountain.
</p>
<p>
There was a small mud hovel at the foot of the mountain, where Owen
determined to pass the night. The old man who lived there, had been a herd
formerly, but age and rheumatism had left him a cripple, and he now lived
on the charity of the neighbours.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor Larry! I don&rsquo;t half like disturbing ye,&rdquo; said Owen, as he arrived at
the miserable contrivance of wattles that served for a door; but the chill
night air, and his weary feet decided the difficulty, and he called out,
&ldquo;Larry&mdash;Larry Daly! open the door for me&mdash;Owen Connor. &lsquo;Tis me!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The old man slept with the light slumber of age, and despite the
consequences of his malady, managed to hobble to the door in a few
seconds. &ldquo;Oh! wirra, wirra! Owen, my son!&rdquo; cried he, in Irish; &ldquo;I hoped
I&rsquo;d never see ye here again&mdash;my own darlin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a dhroll welcome, anyhow, Larry, for a man coming back among his
own people.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;&lsquo;Tis a thrue one, as sure as I live in sin. The Lord help us, this is bad
fortune.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean, Larry? What did I ever do to disgrace my name, that I
wouldn&rsquo;t come back here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t what ye done, honey, but what&rsquo;s done upon ye. Oh, wirra, wirra;
&lsquo;tis a black day that led ye home here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was some time before Owen could induce the old man to moderate his
sorrows, and relate the events which had occurred in his absence. I will
not weary my reader by retailing the old man&rsquo;s prolixity, but tell them in
the fewest words I am able, premising, that I must accompany the narrative
by such explanations as I may feel necessary.
</p>
<p>
Soon after Owen&rsquo;s departure for England, certain disturbances occurred
through the country. The houses of the gentry were broken open at night
and searched for arms by men with blackened faces and in various disguises
to escape recognition. Threatening notices were served on many of the
resident families, menacing them with the worst if they did not speedily
comply with certain conditions, either in the discharge of some obnoxious
individuals from their employment, or the restoration of some plot of
ground to its former holder. Awful denunciations were uttered against any
who should dare to occupy land from which a former tenant was ejected; and
so terrible was the vengeance exacted, and so sudden its execution, that
few dared to transgress the orders of these savage denunciators. The law
of the land seemed to stand still, justice appeared appalled and
affrighted, by acts which bespoke deep and wide-spread conspiracy. The
magistrates assembled to deliberate on what was to be done; and the only
one who ventured to propose a bold and vigorous course of acting was
murdered on his way homeward. Meanwhile, Mr. Lucas, whose stern exactions
had given great discontent, seemed determined to carry through his
measures at any risk. By influence with the government he succeeded in
obtaining a considerable police-force, and, under cover of these, he
issued his distress-warrants and executions, distrained and sold, probably
with a severity increased by the very opposition he met with.
</p>
<p>
The measures undertaken by government to suppress outrage failed most
signally. The difficulty of arresting a suspected individual was great in
a country where a large force was always necessary. The difficulty of
procuring evidence against him was still greater; for even such as were
not banded in the conspiracy, had a greater dread of the reproach of
informer, than of any other imputation; and when these two conditions were
overcome, the last and greatest of all difficulties remained behind,&mdash;no
jury could be found to convict, when their own lives might pay the penalty
of their honesty. While thus, on one side, went the agent, with his
cumbrous accompaniments of law-officers and parchments, police constables
and bailiffs, to effect a distress or an ejectment; the midnight party
with arms patrolled the country, firing the haggards and the farmhouses,
setting all law at defiance, and asserting in their own bloody vengeance
the supremacy of massacre.
</p>
<p>
Not a day went over without its chronicle of crime; the very calendar was
red with murder. Friends parted with a fervour of feeling, that shewed
none knew if they would meet on the morrow; and a dark, gloomy suspicion
prevailed through the land, each dreading his neighbour, and deeming his
isolation more secure than all the ties of friendship. All the bonds of
former love, all the relations of kindred and affection, were severed by
this terrible league. Brothers, fathers, and sons were arrayed against
each other. A despotism was thus set up, which even they who detested
dared not oppose. The very defiance it hurled at superior power, awed and
terrified themselves. Nor was this feeling lessened when they saw that
these dreadful acts&mdash;acts so horrible as to make men shudder at the
name of Ireland when heard in the farthest corner of Europe&mdash;that
these had their apologists in the press, that even a designation was
invented for them, and murder could be spoken of patriotically as the
&ldquo;Wild Justice&rdquo; of the people.
</p>
<p>
There is a terrible contagion in crime. The man whose pure heart had never
harboured a bad thought cannot live untainted where wickedness is rife.
The really base and depraved were probably not many; but there were
hardships and sufferings every where; misery abounded in the land&mdash;misery
too dreadful to contemplate. It was not difficult to connect such
sufferings with the oppressions, real or supposed, of the wealthier
classes. Some, believed the theory with all the avidity of men who grasp
at straws when drowning; others, felt a savage pleasure at the bare
thought of reversing the game of sufferance; while many, mixed up their
own wrongs with what they regarded as national grievances, and converted
their private vengeance into a patriotic daring. Few stood utterly aloof,
and even of these, none would betray the rest.
</p>
<p>
The temporary success of murder, too, became a horrible incentive to its
commission. The agent shot, the law he had set in motion stood still, the
process fell powerless; the &ldquo;Wild Justice&rdquo; superseded the slower footsteps
of common law, and the murderer saw himself installed in safety, when he
ratified his bond in the blood of his victim.
</p>
<p>
Habitual poverty involves so much of degradation, that recklessness of
life is its almost invariable accompaniment; and thus, many of these men
ceased to speculate on the future, and followed the dictates of their
leaders in blind and dogged submission. There were many, too, who felt a
kind of savage enthusiasm in the career of danger, and actually loved the
very hazard of the game. Many more had private wrongs&mdash;old debts of
injury to wipe out&mdash;and grasped at the occasion to acquit them; but
even when no direct motives existed, the terror of evil consequences
induced great numbers to ally themselves with this terrible conspiracy,
and when not active partisans, at least to be faithful and secret
confidants.
</p>
<p>
Among the many dispossessed by the agent was Owen Connor. Scarcely had he
left the neighbourhood, than an ejectment was served against him; and the
bailiff, by whose representations Owen was made to appear a man of
dangerous character, installed in his mountain-farm. This fellow was one
of those bold, devil-may-care ruffians, who survive in every contest
longer than men of more circumspect courage; and Lucas was not sorry to
find that he could establish such an outpost in this wild and dreary
region. Well armed, and provided with a sufficiency of ammunition, he
promised to maintain his strong-hold against any force&mdash;a boast not
so unreasonable, as there was only one approach to the cabin, and that, a
narrow path on the very verge of a precipice. Owen&rsquo;s unexpected appearance
was in his eyes, therefore, a signal for battle; he supposed that he was
come back to assert his ancient right, and in this spirit it was, he
menaced him with instant death if he advanced another step. Indeed, he had
been more than once threatened that Owen&rsquo;s return would be a &ldquo;dark day&rdquo;
 for him, and prepared himself for a meeting with him, as an occasion which
might prove fatal to either. These threats, not sparingly bandied by those
who felt little inclination to do battle on their own account, had become
so frequent, that many looked for Owen&rsquo;s reappearance as for an event of
some moment.
</p>
<p>
Old Larry often heard these reports, and well knowing Owen&rsquo;s ardent
disposition and passionate temper, and how easily he became the tool of
others, when any deed of more than ordinary hazard was presented to him,
grieved deeply over the consequences such promptings might lead to; and
thus it was, that he received him with that outburst of sorrow for which
Owen was little prepared.
</p>
<p>
If Owen was shocked as he listened first to the tale of anarchy and
bloodshed the old man revealed, a savage pleasure came over him
afterwards, to think, what terror these midnight maraudings were making in
the hearts of those who lived in great houses, and had wealth and
influence. His own wrongs rankled too deeply in his breast to make him an
impartial hearer; and already, many of his sympathies were with the
insurgents.
</p>
<p>
It was almost day-break ere he could close his eyes; for although tired
and worn out, the exciting themes he was revolving banished every thought
of sleep, and made him restless and fretful. His last words to Larry, as
he lay down to rest, were a desire that he might remain for a day or two
concealed in his cabin, and that none of the neighbours should learn
anything of his arrival. The truth was, he had not courage to face his
former friends, nor could he bear to meet the Joyces: what step he
purposed to take in the mean while, and how to fashion his future course,
it is hard to say: for the present, he only asked time.
</p>
<p>
The whole of the following day he remained within the little hut; and when
night came, at last ventured forth to breathe the fresh air and move his
cramped limbs. His first object, then, was to go over to Joyce&rsquo;s house,
with no intention of visiting its inmates&mdash;far from it. The poor
fellow had conceived a shrinking horror of the avowal he should be
compelled to make of his own failure, and did not dare to expose himself
to such a test.
</p>
<p>
The night was dark and starless: that heavy, clouded darkness which
follows a day of rain in our western climate, and makes the atmosphere
seem loaded and weighty. To one less accustomed than was Owen, the pathway
would have been difficult to discover; but he knew it well in every
turning and winding, every dip of the ground, and every rock and streamlet
in the course. There was the stillness of death on every side; and
although Owen stopped more than once to listen, not the slightest sound
could be heard. The gloom and dreariness suited well the &ldquo;habit of his
soul.&rdquo; His own thoughts were not of the brightest, and his step was slow
and his head downcast as he went.
</p>
<p>
At last the glimmering of light, hazy and indistinct from the foggy
atmosphere, came into view, and a few minutes after, he entered the little
enclosure of the small garden which flanked one side of the cabin. The
quick bark of a dog gave token of his approach, and Owen found some
difficulty in making himself recognised by the animal, although an old
acquaintance. This done, he crept stealthily to the window from which the
gleam of light issued. The shutters were closed, hut between their
joinings he obtained a view of all within.
</p>
<p>
At one side of the fire was Mary&mdash;his own Mary, when last he parted
with her. She was seated at a spinning-wheel, but seemed less occupied
with the work, than hent on listening to some noise without. Phil also
stood in the attitude of one inclining his ear to catch a sound, and held
a musket in his hand like one ready to resist attack. A farm-servant, a
lad of some eighteen, stood at his side, armed with a horse-pistol, his
features betraying no very equivocal expression of fear and anxiety.
Little Patsy nestled at Mary&rsquo;s side, and with his tiny hands had grasped
her arm closely.
</p>
<p>
They stood there, as if spell-bound. It was evident they were afraid, by
the slightest stir, to lose the chance of hearing any noise without; and
when Mary at last lifted up her head, as if to speak, a quick motion of
her brother&rsquo;s hand warned her to be silent. What a history did that group
reveal to Owen, as, with a heart throbbing fiercely, he gazed upon it! But
a few short months back, and the inmates of that happy home knew not if at
night the door was even latched; the thought of attack or danger never
crossed their minds. The lordly dwellers in a castle felt less security in
their slumbers than did these peasants; now, each night brought a renewal
of their terrors. It came no longer the season of mutual greeting around
the wintry hearth, the hour of rest and repose; but a time of anxiety and
dread, a gloomy period of doubt, harassed by every breeze that stirred,
and every branch that moved.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis nothing <i>this time</i>,&rdquo; said Phil, at last. &ldquo;Thank God for that
same!&rdquo; and he replaced his gun above the chimney, while Mary blessed
herself devoutly, and seemed to repeat a prayer to herself. Owen gave one
parting look, and retired as noiselessly as he came.
</p>
<p>
To creep forth with the dark hours, and stand at this window, became with
Owen, now, the whole business of life. The weary hours of the day were
passed in the expectancy of that brief season&mdash;the only respite he
enjoyed from the corroding cares of his own hard fortune. The dog,
recognising him, no longer barked as he approached; and he could stand
unmolested and look at that hearth, beside which he was wont once to sit
and feel at home.
</p>
<p>
Thus was it, as the third week was drawing to a close, when old Larry, who
had ventured down to the village to make some little purchase, brought
back the news, that information had been sworn by the bailiff against Owen
Connor, for threatening him with death, on pain of his not abandoning his
farm. The people would none of them give any credit to the oath, as none
knew of Owen&rsquo;s return; and the allegation was only regarded as another
instance of the perjury resorted to by their opponents, to crush and
oppress them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have the police out to-morrow, I hear, to search after ye; and
sure the way ye&rsquo;ve kept hid will be a bad job, if they find ye after all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>If</i> they do, Larry!&rdquo; said Owen, laughing; &ldquo;but I think it will
puzzle them to do so.&rdquo; And the very spirit of defiance prevented Owen at
once surrendering himself to the charge against him. He knew every cave
and hiding-place of the mountain, from childhood upwards, and felt proud
to think how he could baffle all pursuit, no matter how persevering his
enemies. It was essential, however, that he should leave his present
hiding-place at once; and no sooner was it dark, than Owen took leave of
old Larry and issued forth. The rain was falling in torrents, accompanied
hy a perfect hurricane, as he left the cabin; fierce gusty blasts swept
down the bleak mountain-side, and with wild and melancholy cadence poured
along the valley; the waters of the lake plashed and beat upon the rocky
shore; the rushing torrents, as they forced their way down the mountain,
swelled the uproar, in which the sound of crashing branches and even rocks
were mingled.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a dreary time to take to the cowld mountain for a home,&rdquo; said Owen,
as he drew his thick frieze coat around him, and turned his shoulder to
the storm. &ldquo;I hardly think the police, or the king&rsquo;s throops either, will
try a chase after me this night.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There was more of gratified pride in this muttered reflection than at
first sight might appear; for Owen felt a kind of heroism in his own
daring at that moment, that supported and actually encouraged him in his
course. The old spirit of bold defiance, which for ages has characterised
the people; the resolute resistance to authority, or to tyranny, which
centuries have not erased, was strong in his hardy nature; and he asked
for nothing better, than to pit his own skill, ingenuity, and endurance
against his opponents, for the mere pleasure of the encounter.
</p>
<p>
As there was little question on Owen&rsquo;s mind that no pursuit of him would
take place on such a night, he resolved to pass the time till day-break
within the walls of the old churchyard, the only spot he could think of
which promised any shelter. There was a little cell or crypt there, where
he could safely remain till morning. An hour&rsquo;s walking brought him to the
little gate, the last time he had entered which, was at his poor father&rsquo;s
funeral. His reflection, now, was rather on his own altered condition
since that day; but even on that thought he suffered himself not to dwell.
In fact, a hardy determination to face the future, in utter forgetfulness
of the past, was the part he proposed to himself; and he did his utmost to
bend his mind to the effort.
</p>
<p>
As he drew near the little crypt I have mentioned, he was amazed to see
the faint flickering of a fire within it. At first a superstitious fear
held him back, and he rapidly repeated some prayers to himself; but the
emotion was soon over, and he advanced boldly toward it. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?
stand! or give the word!&rdquo; said a gruff voice from within. Owen stood
still, but spoke not. The challenge was like that of a sentry, and he
half-feared he had unwittingly strayed within the precincts of a patrol.
&ldquo;Give the word at once! or you&rsquo;ll never spake another,&rdquo; was the savage
speech which, accompanied by a deep curse, now met his ears, while the
click of a gun-Cock was distinctly audible.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a poor man, without a home or a shelter,&rdquo; said Owen, calmly; &ldquo;and
what&rsquo;s worse, I&rsquo;m without arms, or maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t talk so brave.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s yer name? Where are ye from?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Owen Connor; that&rsquo;s enough for ye, whoever ye are,&rdquo; replied he,
resolutely; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a name I&rsquo;m not ashamed nor afraid to say, anywhere.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The man within the cell threw a handful of dry furze upon the smouldering
flame, and while he remained concealed himself, took a deliberate survey
of Owen as he stood close to the doorway. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, Owen,&rdquo; said he,
in an altered voice, and one which Owen immediately recognised as that of
the old blacksmith, Miles Regan; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re welcome, my boy! better late than
never, anyhow!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean, Miles? &lsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t expecting me here ye were, I suppose?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis just that same then, I was expecting this many a day,&rdquo; said Miles,
as with a rugged grasp of both hands he drew Owen within the narrow cell.
&ldquo;And &lsquo;t&rsquo;aint me only was expecting it, but every one else. Here, avich,
taste this&mdash;ye&rsquo;re wet and cowld both; that will put life in ye&mdash;and
it never ped tha king sixpence.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And he handed Owen a quart bottle as he spoke, the odour of which was
unmistakeable enough, to bear testimony to his words.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what brings you here, Miles, in the name of God?&rdquo; said Owen, for his
surprise at the meeting increased every moment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis your own case, only worse,&rdquo; said the other, with a drunken laugh,
for the poteen had already affected his head.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s that, if I might make bould?&rdquo; said Owen, rather angrily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just that I got the turn-out, my boy. That new chap, they have over the
property, sould me out, root and branch; and as I didn&rsquo;t go quiet, ye see,
they brought the polis down, and there was a bit of a fight, to take the
two cows away; and somehow&rdquo;&mdash;here he snatched the bottle rudely from
Owen&rsquo;s hand, and swallowed a copious draught of it&mdash;&ldquo;and, somehow,
the corporal was killed, and I thought it better to be away for a while&mdash;for,
at the inquest, though the boys would take &lsquo;the vestment&rsquo; they seen him
shot by one of his comrades, there was a bit of a smash in his skull, ye
see&rdquo;&mdash;here he gave a low fearful laugh&mdash;&ldquo;that fitted neatly to
the top of my eleven-pound hammer; ye comprehend?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Owen&rsquo;s blood ran cold as he said, &ldquo;Ye don&rsquo;t mean it was you that killed
him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do then,&rdquo; replied the other, with a savage grin, as he placed his face
within a few inches of Owen&rsquo;s. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a hundred pounds blood-money for
ye, now, if ye give the information! A hundred pounds,&rdquo; muttered he to
himself; &ldquo;musha, I never thought they&rsquo;d give ten shillings for my own four
bones before!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Owen scorned to reply to the insinuation of his turning informer, and sat
moodily thinking over the event.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be going, anyhow,&rdquo; said he rising, for his abhorrence of his
companion made him feel the storm and the hurricane a far preferable
alternative.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The divil a one foot ye&rsquo;ll leave this, my boy,&rdquo; said Miles, grasping him
with the grip of his gigantic hand; &ldquo;no, no, ma bouchai, &lsquo;tisn&rsquo;t so easy
airned as ye think; a hundred pounds, naboclish!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Leave me free! let go my arm!&rdquo; said Owen, whose anger now rose at the
insolence of this taunt.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll break it across my knee, first,&rdquo; said the infuriated ruffian, as he
half imitated by a gesture his horrid threat.
</p>
<p>
There was no comparison in point of bodily strength between them; for
although Owen was not half the other&rsquo;s age, and had the advantage of being
perfectly sober, the smith was a man of enormous power, and held him, as
though he were a child in his grasp.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d be at, my boy, is it?&rdquo; said Miles, scoffing; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
the fine thrade you choose! but maybe it&rsquo;s not so pleasant, after all.
Stay still there&mdash;be quiet, I say&mdash;by&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; and here
he uttered a most awful oath&mdash;&ldquo;if you rouse me, I&rsquo;ll paste your
brains against that wall;&rdquo; and as he spoke, he dashed his closed fist
against the rude and crumbling masonry, with a force that shook several
large stones from their places, and left his knuckles one
indistinguishable mass of blood and gore.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s brave, anyhow,&rdquo; said Owen, with a bitter mockery, for his own
danger, at the moment, could not repress his contempt for the savage
conduct of the other.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, the besotted intellect of the smith made him accept the
speech in a very different sense, and he said, &ldquo;There never was the man
yet, I wouldn&rsquo;t give him two blows at me, for one at him, and mine to be
the last.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I often heard of that before,&rdquo; said Owen, who saw that any attempt to
escape by main force was completely out of the question, and that
stratagem alone could present a chance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did ye ever hear of Dan Lenahan?&rdquo; said Miles, with a grin; &ldquo;what I did to
Dan: I was to fight him wid one hand, and the other tied behind my back;
and when he came up to shake hands wid me before the fight, I just put my
thumb in my hand, that way, and I smashed his four fingers over it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There was no fight that day, anyhow, Miles.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thrue for ye, boy; the sport was soon over&mdash;raich me over the
bottle,&rdquo; and with that, Miles finished the poteen at a draught, and then
lay back against the wall, as if to sleep. Still, he never relinquished
his grasp, but, as he fell off asleep, held him as in a vice.
</p>
<p>
As Owen sat thus a prisoner, turning over in his mind every possible
chance of escape, he heard the sound of feet and men&rsquo;s voices rapidly
approaching; and, in a few moments, several men turned into the
churchyard, and came towards the crypt. They were conversing in a low but
hurried voice, which was quickly hushed as they came nearer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this,&rdquo; cried one, as he entered the cell; &ldquo;Miles has a prisoner
here!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faix, he has so, Mickey;&rdquo; answered Owen, for he recognised in the speaker
an old friend and schoolfellow. The rest came hurriedly forward at the
words, and soon Owen found himself among a number of his former
companions. Two or three of the party were namesakes and relations.
</p>
<p>
The explanation of his capture was speedily given, and they all laughed
heartily at Owen&rsquo;s account of his ingenious efforts at flattery.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Av the poteen held out, Owen dear, ye wouldn&rsquo;t have had much trouble; but
he can drink two quarts before he loses his strength.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In return for his narrative, they freely and frankly told their own story.
They had been out arms-hunting&mdash;unsuccessfully, however&mdash;their
only exploit being the burning of a haggard belonging to a farmer who
refused to join the &ldquo;rising.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Owen felt greatly relieved to discover, that his old friends regarded the
smith with a horror fully as great as his own. But they excused themselves
for the companionship by saying, &ldquo;What are we to do with the crayture? Ye
wouldn&rsquo;t have us let him be taken?&rdquo; And thus they were compelled to
practise every measure for the security of one they had no love for, and
whose own excesses increased the hazard tenfold.
</p>
<p>
The marauding exploits they told of, were, to Owen&rsquo;s ears, not devoid of a
strange interest, the danger alone had its fascination for him; and,
artfully interwoven as their stories were with sentiments of affected
patriotism and noble aspirations for the cause of their country, they
affected him strongly.
</p>
<p>
For, strange as it may seem, a devotion to country&mdash;a mistaken sense
of national honour&mdash;prompted many to these lawless courses. Vague
notions of confiscated lands to be restored to their rightful possessors;
ancient privileges reconferred; their church once more endowed with its
long-lost wealth and power: such were the motives of the more
high-spirited and independent. Others sought redress for personal
grievances; some real or imaginary hardship they laboured under; or,
perhaps, as was not unfrequent, they bore the memory of some old grudge or
malice, which they hoped now to have an opportunity of requiting. Many
were there, who, like the weak-minded in all popular commotions, float
with the strong tide, whichever way it may run. They knew not the objects
aimed at; they were ignorant of the intentions of their leaders; but would
not be under the stain of cowardice among their companions, nor shrink
from any cause where there was danger, if only for that very reason. Thus
was the mass made up, of men differing in various ways; but all held
together by the common tie of a Church and a Country. It might be supposed
that the leaders in such a movement would be those who, having suffered
some grievous wrong, were reckless enough to adventure on any course that
promised vengeance;&mdash;very far from this. The principal promoters of
the insurrection were of the class of farmers&mdash;men well to do, and
reputed, in many cases wealthy. The instruments by which they worked were
indeed of the very poorer class&mdash;the cottier, whose want and misery
had eat into his nature, and who had as little room for fear as for hope
in his chilled heart. Some injury sustained by one of these, some piece of
justice denied him; his ejection from his tenement; a chance word,
perhaps, spoken to him in anger by his landlord or the agent, were the
springs which moved a man like this, and brought him into confederacy with
those who promised him a speedy repayment of his wrongs, and flattered him
into the belief that his individual case had all the weight and importance
of a national question. Many insurrectionary movements have grown into the
magnitude of systematic rebellion from the mere assumption on the part of
others, that they were prearranged and predetermined. The self-importance
suggested by a bold opposition to the law, is a strong agent in arming men
against its terrors. The mock martyrdom of Ireland is in this way,
perhaps, her greatest and least curable evil.
</p>
<p>
Owen was, of all others, the man they most wished for amongst them.
Independent of his personal courage and daring, he was regarded as one
fruitful in expedients, and never deterred by difficulties. This mingled
character of cool determination and headlong impulse, made him exactly
suited to become a leader; and many a plot was thought of, to draw him
into their snares, when the circumstances of his fortune thus anticipated
their intentions.
</p>
<p>
It would not forward the object of my little tale to dwell upon the life
he now led. It was indeed an existence full of misery and suffering. To
exaggerate the danger of his position, his companions asserted that the
greatest efforts were making for his capture, rewards offered, and spies
scattered far and wide through the country; and while they agreed with him
that nothing could be laid to his charge, they still insisted, that were
he once taken, false-swearing and perjury would bring him to the gallows,
&ldquo;as it did many a brave boy before him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Half-starved, and harassed by incessant change of place; tortured by the
fevered agony of a mind halting between a deep purpose of vengeance and a
conscious sense of innocence, his own daily sufferings soon brought down
his mind to that sluggish state of gloomy desperation, in which the very
instincts of our better nature seem dulled and blunted. &ldquo;I cannot be
worse!&rdquo; was his constant expression, as he wandered alone by some
unfrequented mountain-path, or along the verge of some lonely ravine. &ldquo;I
cannot be worse!&rdquo; It is an evil moment that suggests a thought like this!
</p>
<p>
Each night he was accustomed to repair to the old churchyard, where some
of the &ldquo;boys,&rdquo; as they called themselves, assembled to deliberate on
future measures, or talk over the past. It was less in sympathy with their
plans that Owen came, than for the very want of human companionship. His
utter solitude gave him a longing to hear their voices, and see their
faces; while in their recitals of outrage, he felt that strange pleasure
the sense of injury supplies, at any tale of sorrow and suffering.
</p>
<p>
At these meetings the whisky-bottle was never forgotten; and while some
were under a pledge not to take more than a certain quantity&mdash;a vow
they kept most religiously&mdash;others drank deeply. Among these was
Owen. The few moments of reckless forgetfulness he then enjoyed were the
coveted minutes of his long dreary day, and he wished for night to come as
the last solace that was left him.
</p>
<p>
His companions knew him too well, to endeavour by any active influence to
implicate him in their proceedings. They cunningly left the work to time
and his own gloomy thoughts; watching, however, with eager anxiety, how,
gradually he became more and more interested in all their doings; how, by
degrees he ceased even the half-remonstrance against some deed of
unnecessary cruelty; and listened with animation where before he but heard
with apathy, if not repugnance. The weeds of evil grow rankest in the rich
soil of a heart whose nature, once noble, has been perverted and debased.
Ere many weeks passed over, Owen, so far from disliking the theme of
violence and outrage, became half-angry with his comrades, that they
neither proposed any undertaking to him, nor even asked his assistance
amongst them.
</p>
<p>
This spirit grew hourly stronger in him; offended pride worked within his
heart during the tedious days he spent alone, and he could scarcely
refrain from demanding what lack of courage and daring they saw in him,
that he should be thus forgotten and neglected.
</p>
<p>
In this frame of mind, irresolute as to whether he should not propose
himself for some hazardous scheme, or still remain a mere spectator of
others, he arrived one evening in the old churchyard. Of late, &ldquo;the boys,&rdquo;
 from preconcerted arrangements among themselves, had rather made a show of
cold and careless indifference in their manner to Owen&mdash;conduct which
deeply wounded him.
</p>
<p>
As he approached now the little crypt, he perceived that a greater number
than usual were assembled through the churchyard, and many were gathered
in little knots and groups, talking eagerly together; a half-nod, a
scarcely muttered &ldquo;Good even,&rdquo; was all the salutation he met, as he moved
towards the little cell, where, by the blaze of a piece of bog-pine, a
party were regaling themselves&mdash;the custom and privilege of those who
had been last out on any marauding expedition. A smoking pot of potatoes
and some bottles of whisky formed the entertainment, at which Owen stood a
longing and famished spectator.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will yez never be done there eatin&rsquo; and crammin&rsquo; yerselves?&rdquo; said a gruff
voice from the crowd to the party within; &ldquo;and ye know well enough there&rsquo;s
business to be done to-night.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And ain&rsquo;t we doing it?&rdquo; answered one of the feasters. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your
health, Peter!&rdquo; and so saying, he took a very lengthened draught from the
&ldquo;poteen&rdquo; bottle.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis the thrade ye like best, anyhow,&rdquo; retorted the other. &ldquo;Come, boys;
be quick now!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The party did not wait a second bidding, but arose from the place, and
removing the big pot to make more room, they prepared the little cell for
the reception of some other visitors.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it now! We&rsquo;ll not be long about it. Larry, have yez the deck,&rsquo; my
boy?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the book, darlint,&rdquo; said a short, little, de-crepid creature,
speaking with an asthmatic effort, as he produced a pack of cards, which,
if one were to judge from the dirt, made the skill of the game consist as
much in deciphering as playing them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Sam M&rsquo;Guire?&rdquo; called out the first speaker, in a voice loud
enough to be heard over the whole space around; and the name was repeated
from voice to voice, till it was replied to by one who cried&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here, sir; am I wanted?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are, Sam; and &lsquo;tis yourself is always to the fore when we need yez.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope so indeed,&rdquo; said Sam, as he came forward, a flush of gratified
pride on his hardy cheek. He was a young, athletic fellow, with a fine
manly countenance, expressive of frankness and candour.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Luke Heffernan! where&rsquo;s Luke?&rdquo; said the other.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here beside ye,&rdquo; answered a dark-visaged, middle-aged man, with the
collar of his frieze coat buttoned high on his face; &ldquo;ye needn&rsquo;t be
shouting my name that way&mdash;there may be more bad than good among uz.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not an informer, any way&mdash;if that&rsquo;s what ye mean,&rdquo; said the
other quickly. &ldquo;Gavan Daly! Call Gavan Daly, will ye, out there?&rdquo; And the
words were passed from mouth to mouth in a minute, but no one replied to
the summons.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not here&mdash;Gavan&rsquo;s not here!&rdquo; was the murmured answer of the
crowd, given in a tone that hoded very little in favour of its absent
owner.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not here!&rdquo; said the leader, as he crushed the piece of paper, from which
he read, in his hand; &ldquo;not here! Where is he, then? Does any of yez know
where&rsquo;s Gavan Daly?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
But there was no answer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Can no body tell?&mdash;is he sick?&mdash;or is any belonging to him sick
and dying, that he isn&rsquo;t here this night, as he swore to be?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I saw him wid a new coat on him this morning early in Oughterarde, and he
said he was going to see a cousin of his down below Oranmore,&rdquo; said a
young lad from the outside of the crowd, and the speaker was in a moment
surrounded by several, anxious to find out some other particulars of the
absent man. It was evident that the boy&rsquo;s story was far from being
satisfactory, and the circumstance of Daly&rsquo;s wearing a new coat, was one
freely commented on by those who well knew how thoroughly they were in the
power of any who should betray them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the black list this night,&rdquo; said the leader, as he motioned the
rest to be silent; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s where I put him now; and see, all of yez&mdash;mind
my words&mdash;if any of uz comes to harm, it will go hard but some will
be spared; and if there was only one remaining, he wouldn&rsquo;t be the
cowardly villain not to see vengeance on Gavan Daly, for what he&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A murmur of indignation at the imputed treachery of the absent man buzzed
through the crowd; while one fellow, with a face flushed by drink, and
eyes bleared and bloodshot, cried out: &ldquo;And are ye to stop here all night,
calling for the boy that&rsquo;s gone down to bethray yez? Is there none of yez
will take his place?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will! I will! I&rsquo;m ready and willin&rsquo;!&rdquo; were uttered by full twenty, in a
breath.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who will ye have with yez? take your own choice!&rdquo; said the leader,
turning towards M&rsquo;Quire and Heffernan, who stood whispering eagerly
together.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the boy I&rsquo;d take out of five hundred, av he was the same I knew
once,&rdquo; said M&rsquo;Guire, laying his hand on Owen&rsquo;s shoulder.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Begorra then, I wondher what ye seen in him lately to give you a consate
out of him,&rdquo; cried Heffernan, with a rude laugh. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t all he&rsquo;s done
for the cause anyway.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Owen started, and fixed his eyes first on one, then on the other of the
speakers; but his look was rather the vacant stare of one awakening from a
heavy sleep, than the expression of any angry passion&mdash;for want and
privation had gone far to sap his spirit, as well as his bodily strength.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There, avich, taste that,&rdquo; said a man beside him, who was struck by his
pale and wasted cheek, and miserable appearance.
</p>
<p>
Owen almost mechanically took the bottle, and drank freely, though the
contents was strong poteen.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are ye any betther now?&rdquo; said Heffernan, with a sneering accent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Owen, calmly, for he was unconscious of the insolence passed
off on him; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a deal better.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come along, ma bouchal!&rdquo; cried M&rsquo;Guire; &ldquo;come into the little place with
us, here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What do ye want with me, boys?&rdquo; asked Owen, looking about him through the
crowd.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis to take a hand at the cards, divil a more,&rdquo; said an old fellow near,
and the speech sent a savage laugh among the rest.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready and willin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Owen; &ldquo;but sorra farthen I&rsquo;ve left me to
play; and if the stakes is high&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faix, that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; said Heffernan; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re the lowest ever
ye played for.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tell me what it is, anyway,&rdquo; cried Owen.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just, the meanest thing at all&mdash;the life of the blaguard that turned
yerself out of yer holdin&rsquo;&mdash;Lucas the agent.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To kill Lucas?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That same; and if ye don&rsquo;t like the game, turn away and make room for a
boy that has more spirit in him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who says I ever was afeard?&rdquo; said Owen, on whom now the whisky was
working. &ldquo;Is it Luke Heffernan dares to face me down?&mdash;come out here,
fair, and see will ye say it again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t join the cause, you mustn&rsquo;t be bringing bad blood among us,&rdquo;
 cried the leader, in a determined tone; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s many a brave boy here
to-night would give his right hand to get the offer you did.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready&mdash;here I am, ready now,&rdquo; shouted Owen wildly; &ldquo;tell me what
you want me to do, and see whether I will or no.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A cheer broke from the crowd at these words, and all within his reach
stretched out their hands to grasp Owen&rsquo;s; and commendations were poured
on him from every side.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Heffernan and his companion had cleared the little crypt of its
former occupants, and having heaped fresh wood upon the fire, sat down
before the blaze, and called out for Owen to join them. Owen took another
draught from one of the many bottles offered by the bystanders, and
hastened to obey the summons.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stand back now, and don&rsquo;t speak a word,&rdquo; cried the leader, keeping off
the anxious crowd that pressed eagerly forward to witness the game; the
hushed murmuring of the voices shewing how deeply interested they felt.
</p>
<p>
The three players bent their heads forward as they sat, while Heffernan
spoke some words in a low whisper, to which the others responded by a
muttered assent. &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s success to the undhertakin&rsquo; anyhow,&rdquo; cried
he aloud, and filling out a glass of whisky, drank it off; then passing
the liquor to the two others, they followed his example.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will ye like to deal, Owen?&rdquo; said M&rsquo;Guire; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the new-comer, and
we&rsquo;ll give ye the choice.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, thank ye, boys,&rdquo; said Owen; &ldquo;do it yerselves, one of ye; I&rsquo;m sure of
fair play.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Heffernan then took the cards, and wetting his thumb for the convenience
of better distributing them, slowly laid five cards before each player; he
paused for a second before he turned the trump, and in a low voice said:
&ldquo;If any man&rsquo;s faint-hearted, let him say it now&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Turn the card round, and don&rsquo;t be bothering us,&rdquo; cried M&rsquo;Guire; &ldquo;one &lsquo;ud
think we never played a game before.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, be alive,&rdquo; said Owen, in whom the liquor had stimulated the passion
for play.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the thrump&mdash;is it a diamond? look over and tell us,&rdquo; murmured
the crowd nearest the entrance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a spade!&mdash;I lay fourpence &lsquo;tis a spade!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t it be?&rdquo; said another; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the same spade will dig Lucas&rsquo;s
grave this night!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Look! see!&rdquo; whispered another, &ldquo;Owen Connor&rsquo;s won the first thrick! Watch
him now! Mind the way he lays the card down, with a stroke of his fist!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish he wouldn&rsquo;t be drinking so fast!&rdquo; said another.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who won that? who took that thrick?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ould Heffernan, divil fear him! I
never see him lose yet.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another; that&rsquo;s Owen&rsquo;s!&rdquo; &ldquo;No; by Jonas! &lsquo;tis Luke again has it.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Sam M&rsquo;Quire&rsquo;s! See how aizy he takes them up.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now for it, boys! whisht! here&rsquo;s the last round!&rdquo; and at this moment, a
breathless silence prevailed among the crowd; for while such as were
nearest were eagerly bent on observing the progress of the game, the more
distant bent their heads to catch every sound that might indicate its
fortune.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;See how Luke grins! watch his face!&rdquo; whispered a low voice. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t
care how it goes, now, he&rsquo;s out of it!&rdquo; and so it was. Heffernan had
already won two of the five tricks, and was safe whatever the result of
the last one. The trial lay between M&rsquo;Guire and Owen.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, Owen, my hearty!&rdquo; said M&rsquo;Guire, as he held a card ready to play,
&ldquo;you or I for it now; we&rsquo;ll soon see which the devil&rsquo;s fondest of. There&rsquo;s
the two of clubs for ye!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the three, then!&rdquo; said Owen, with a crash of his hand, as he
placed the card over the other.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s the four!&rdquo; said Heffernan, &ldquo;and the thrick is Sam M&rsquo;Guire&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Owen Connor&rsquo;s lost!&rdquo; &ldquo;Owen&rsquo;s lost!&rdquo; murmured the crowd; and, whether in
half-compassion for his defeat, or grief that so hazardous a deed should
be entrusted to a doubtful hand, the sensation created was evidently of
gloom and dissatisfaction.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a right to take either of us wid ye, Owen,&rdquo; said M&rsquo;Guire, slapping
him on the shoulder. &ldquo;Luke or myself must go, if ye want us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;ll do it myself,&rdquo; said Owen, in a low hollow voice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the tool, then!&rdquo; said Heffernan, producing from the breast of his
frieze coat a long horse-pistol, the stock of which was mended by a clasp
of iron belted round it; &ldquo;and if it doesn&rsquo;t do its work, &lsquo;tis the first
time it ever failed. Ould Miles Cregan, of Gurtane, was the last that
heard it spake.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Owen took the weapon, and examined it leisurely, opening the pan and
settling the priming, with a finger that never trembled. As he drew forth
the ramrod to try the barrel, Heffernan said, with a half-grin, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
two bullets in it, avich!&mdash;enough&rsquo;s as good as a feast.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Owen sat still and spoke not, while the leader and Heffernan explained to
him the circumstances of the plot against the life of Mr. Lucas.
Information had been obtained by some of the party, that the agent would
leave Galway on the following evening, on his way to Westport, passing
through Oughterarde and their own village, about midnight. He usually
travelled in his gig, with relays of horses ready at different stations of
the way, one of which was about two miles distant from the old ruin, on
the edge of the lake&mdash;a wild and dreary spot, where stood a solitary
cabin, inhabited by a poor man who earned his livelihood by fishing. No
other house was within a mile of this; and here, it was determined, while
in the act of changing horses, the murder should be effected. The bleak
common beside the lake was studded with furze and brambles, beneath which
it was easy to obtain shelter, though pursuit was not to be apprehended&mdash;at
least they judged that the servant would not venture to leave his master
at such a moment; and as for the fisherman, although not a sworn member of
their party, they well knew he would not dare to inform against the
meanest amongst them.
</p>
<p>
Owen listened attentively to all these details, and the accurate
directions by which they instructed him on every step he should take. From
the moment he should set foot within the cover to the very instant of
firing, each little event had its warning.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mind!&rdquo; repeated Heffernan, with a slow, distinct whisper, &ldquo;he never goes
into the house at all; but if the night&rsquo;s cowld&mdash;as it&rsquo;s sure to be
this sayson&mdash;he&rsquo;ll be moving up and down, to keep his feet warm.
Cover him as he turns round; but don&rsquo;t fire the first cover, but wait till
he comes back to the same place again, and then blaze. Don&rsquo;t stir then,
till ye see if he falls: if he does, be off down the common; but if he&rsquo;s
only wounded&mdash;but sure ye&rsquo;ll do better than that!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go bail he will!&rdquo; said M&rsquo;Guire. &ldquo;Sorra fear that Owen Connor&rsquo;s heart
would fail him! and sure if he likes me to be wid him&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said Owen, in the same hollow voice as before, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it all
by myself; I want nobody.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis the very words I said when I shot Lambert of Kilclunah!&rdquo; said
M&rsquo;Guire. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know him by looks, and the boys wanted me to take some
one to point him out. &lsquo;Sorra bit!&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;leave that to me;&rsquo; and so I
waited in the gripe of the ditch all day, till, about four in the evening,
I seen a stout man wid a white hat coming across the fields, to where the
men was planting potatoes. So I ups to him wid a letter in my hand, this
way, and my hat off&mdash;&lsquo;Is yer honner Mr. Lambert?&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; says
he; &lsquo;what do ye want with me?&rsquo; &lsquo;&lsquo;Tis a bit of a note I&rsquo;ve for yer honner,&rsquo;
says I; and I gav him the paper. He tuck it and opened it; but troth it
was little matter there was no writin&rsquo; in it, for he would&rsquo;nt have lived
to read it through. I sent the ball through his heart, as near as I stand
to ye; the wadding was burning his waistcoat when I left him. &lsquo;God save
you!&rsquo; says the men, as I went across the potato-field. &lsquo;Save you kindly!&rsquo;
says I. &lsquo;Was that a shot we heard?&rsquo; says another. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;I was
fright&rsquo;ning the crows;&rsquo; and sorra bit, but that&rsquo;s a saying they have
against me ever since.&rdquo; These last few words were said in a simper of
modesty, which, whether real or affected, was a strange sentiment at the
conclusion of such a tale.
</p>
<p>
The party soon after separated, not to meet again for several nights; for
the news of Lucas&rsquo;s death would of course be the signal for a general
search through the country, and the most active measures to trace the
murderer. It behoved them, then, to be more than usually careful not to be
absent from their homes and their daily duties for some days at least:
after which they could assemble in safety as before.
</p>
<p>
Grief has been known to change the hair to grey in a single night; the
announcement of a sudden misfortune has palsied the hand that held the
ill-omened letter; but I question if the hours that are passed before the
commission of a great crime, planned and meditated beforehand, do not work
more fearful devastation on the human heart, than all the sorrows that
ever crushed humanity. Ere night came, Owen Connor seemed to have grown
years older. In the tortured doublings of his harassed mind he appeared to
have spent almost a lifetime since the sun last rose. He had passed in
review before him each phase of his former existence, from childhood&mdash;free,
careless, and happy childhood&mdash;to days of boyish sport and revelry;
then came the period of his first manhood, with its new ambitions and
hopes. He thought of these, and how, amid the humble circumstances of his
lowly fortune, he was happy. What would he have thought of him who should
predict such a future as this for him? How could he have believed it? And
yet the worst of all remained to come. He tried to rally his courage and
steel his heart, by repeating over the phrases so frequent among his
companions. &ldquo;Sure, aint I driven to it? is it my fault if I take to this,
or theirs that compelled me?&rdquo; and such like. But these words came with no
persuasive force in the still hour of conscience: they were only effectual
amid the excitement and tumult of a multitude, when men&rsquo;s passions were
high, and their resolutions daring. &ldquo;It is too late to go back,&rdquo; muttered
he, as he arose from the spot, where, awaiting nightfall, he had lain hid
for several hours; &ldquo;they mustn&rsquo;t call me a coward, any way.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
As Owen reached the valley the darkness spread far and near, not a star
could be seen; great masses of cloud covered the sky, and hung down
heavily, midway upon the mountains. There was no rain; but on the wind
came from time to time a drifted mist, which shewed that the air was
charged with moisture. The ground was still wet and plashy from recent
heavy rain. It was indeed a cheerless night and a cheerless hour; but not
more so than the heart of him who now, bent upon his deadly purpose, moved
slowly on towards the common.
</p>
<p>
On descending towards the lake-side, he caught a passing view of the
little village, where a few lights yet twinkled, the flickering stars that
shone within some humble home. What would he not have given to be but the
meanest peasant there, the poorest creature that toiled and sickened on
his dreary way! He turned away hurriedly, and with his hand pressed
heavily on his swelling heart walked rapidly on. &ldquo;It will soon be over
now,&rdquo; said Owen; he was about to add, with the accustomed piety of his
class, &ldquo;thank God for it,&rdquo; but the words stopped in his throat, and the
dreadful thought flashed on him, &ldquo;Is it when I am about to shed His
creature&rsquo;s blood, I should say this?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>

</div>
<p>
He sat down upon a large stone beside the lake, at a spot where the road
came down to the water&rsquo;s edge, and where none could pass unobserved by
him. He had often fished from that very rock when a boy, and eaten his
little dinner of potatoes beneath its shelter. Here he sat once more;
saying to himself as he did so, &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis an ould friend, anyway, and I&rsquo;ll
just spend my last night with him;&rdquo;, for so in his mind he already
regarded his condition. The murder effected, he determined to make no
effort to escape. Life was of no value to him. The snares of the
conspiracy had entangled him, but his heart was not in it.
</p>
<p>
As the night wore on, the clouds lifted, and the wind, increasing to a
storm, bore them hurriedly through the air; the waters of the lake, lashed
into waves, beat heavily on the low shore; while the howling blast swept
through the mountain-passes, and over the bleak, wide plain, with a
rushing sound. The thin crescent of a new moon could be seen from time to
time as the clouds rolled past: too faint to shed any light upon the
earth, it merely gave form to the dark masses that moved before it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will do it here,&rdquo; said Owen, as he stood and looked upon the dark water
that beat against the foot of the rock; &ldquo;here, on this spot.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He sat for some moments with his ear bent to listen, but the storm was
loud enough to make all other sounds inaudible; yet, in every noise he
thought he heard the sound of wheels, and the rapid tramp of a horse&rsquo;s
feet. The motionless attitude, the cold of the night, but more than
either, the debility brought on by long fasting and hunger, benumbed his
limbs, so that he felt almost unable to make the least exertion, should
any such be called for.
</p>
<p>
He therefore descended from the rock and moved along the road; at first,
only thinking of restoring lost animation to his frame, but at length, in
a half unconsciousness, he had wandered upwards of two miles beyond the
little hovel where the change of horses was to take place. Just as he was
on the point of returning, he perceived at a little distance, in front,
the walls of a now ruined cabin, once the home of the old smith. Part of
the roof had fallen in, the doors and windows were gone, the fragment of
an old shutter alone remained, and this banged heavily back and forwards
as the storm rushed through the wretched hut.
</p>
<p>
Almost without knowing it, Owen entered the cabin, and sat down beside the
spot where once the forge-fire used to burn. He had been there, too, when
a boy many a time&mdash;many a story had he listened to in that same
corner; but why think of this now? The cold blast seemed to freeze his
very blood&mdash;he felt his heart as if congealed within him. He sat
cowering from the piercing blast for some time; and at last, unable to
bear the sensation longer, determined to kindle a fire with the fragments
of the old shutter. For this purpose he drew the charge of the pistol, in
which there were three bullets, and not merely two, as Heffernan had told
him. Laying these carefully down in his handkerchief, he kindled a light
with some powder, and, with the dexterity of one not unaccustomed to such
operations, soon saw the dry sticks blazing on the hearth. On looking
about he discovered a few sods of turf and some dry furze, with which he
replenished his fire, till it gradually became a warm and cheering blaze.
Owen now reloaded the pistol, just as he had found it. There was a sense
of duty in his mind to follow out every instruction he received, and
deviate in nothing. This done, he held his numbed fingers over the blaze,
and bared his chest to the warm glow of the fire.
</p>
<p>
The sudden change from the cold night-air to the warmth of the cabin soon
made him drowsy. Fatigue and watching aiding the inclination to sleep, he
was obliged to move about the hut, and even expose himself to the chill
blast, to resist its influence. The very purpose on which he was bent, so
far from dispelling sleep, rather induced its approach; for, strange as it
may seem, the concentration with which the mind brings its powers to bear
on any object will overcome all the interest and anxiety of our natures,
and bring on sleep from very weariness.
</p>
<p>
He slept, at first, calmly and peacefully&mdash;exhaustion would have its
debt acquitted&mdash;and he breathed as softly as an infant. At last, when
the extreme of fatigue was passed, his brain began to busy itself with
flitting thoughts and fancies,&mdash;some long-forgotten day of boyhood,
some little scene of childish gaiety, flashed across him, and he dreamed
of the old mountain-lake, where so often he watched the wide circles of
the leaping trout, or tracked with his eye the foamy path of the wild
water-hen, as she skimmed the surface. Then suddenly his chest heaved and
fell with a strong motion, for with lightning&rsquo;s speed the current of his
thoughts was changed; his heart was in the mad tumult of a faction-fight,
loud shouts were ringing in his ears, the crash of sticks, the cries of
pain, entreaties for mercy, execrations and threats, rung around him, when
one figure moved slowly before his astonished gaze, with a sweet smile
upon her lips, and love in her long-lashed eyes. She murmured his name;
and now he slept with a low-drawn breath, his quivering lips repeating,
&ldquo;Mary!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Another and a sadder change was coming. He was on the mountains, in the
midst of a large assemblage of wild-looking and haggard men, whose violent
speech and savage gestures well suited their reckless air. A loud shout
welcomed him as he came amongst them, and a cry of &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Owen Connor&mdash;Owen
at last!&rdquo; and a hundred hands were stretched out to grasp his, but as
suddenly withdrawn, on seeing that his hands were not bloodstained nor
gory.
</p>
<p>
He shuddered as he looked upon their dripping fingers; but he shuddered
still more as they called him &ldquo;Coward!&rdquo; What he said he knew not; but in a
moment they were gathered round him, and clasping him in their arms; and
now, his hands, his cheeks, his clothes, were streaked with blood; he
tried to wipe the foul stains out, but his fingers grew clotted, and his
feet seemed to plash in the red stream, and his savage comrades laughed
fiercely at his efforts, and mocked him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What am I, that you should clasp me thus?&rdquo; he cried; and a voice from his
inmost heart replied, &ldquo;A murderer!&rdquo; The cold sweat rolled in great drops
down his brow, while the foam of agony dewed his pallid lips, and his
frame trembled in a terrible convulsion. Confused and fearful images of
bloodshed and its penalty, the crime and the scaffold, commingled, worked
in his maddened brain. He heard the rush of feet, as if thousands were
hurrying on, to see him die, and voices that swelled like the sea at
midnight. Nor was the vision all unreal: for already two men had entered
the hut.
</p>
<p>
The dreadful torture of his thoughts had now reached its climax, and with
a bound Owen sprang from his sleep, and cried in a shriek of heart-wrung
anguish, &ldquo;No, never&mdash;I am not a murderer. Owen Connor can meet his
death like a man, but not with blood upon him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Owen Connor! Owen Connor, did you say?&rdquo; repeated one of the two who stood
before him; &ldquo;are you, then, Owen Connor?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied Owen, whose dreams were still the last impression on his
mind. &ldquo;I give myself up;&mdash;do what ye will with me;&mdash;hang,
imprison, or transport me; I&rsquo;ll never gainsay you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Owen, do you not know me?&rdquo; said the other, removing his travelling cap,
and brushing back the hair from his forehead.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, I know nothing of you,&rdquo; said he, fiercely.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not remember your old friend&mdash;your landlord&rsquo;s son, Owen?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Owen stared at him without speaking; his parted lips and fixed gaze
evidencing the amazement which came over him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You saved my life, Owen,&rdquo; said the young man, horror-struck by the
withered and wasted form of the peasant.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you have made me this,&rdquo; muttered Owen, as he let fall the pistol from
his bosom. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried he, with an energy very different from before, &ldquo;I
came out this night, sworn to murder that man beside you&mdash;your agent,
Lucas; my soul is perjured if my hands are not bloody.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lucas instantly took a pistol from the breast of his coat, and cocked it;
while the ghastly whiteness of his cheek shewed he did not think the
danger was yet over.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Put up your weapon,&rdquo; said Owen, contemptuously. &ldquo;What would I care for
it, if I wanted to take your life? do you think the likes of me has any
hould on the world?&rdquo; and he laughed a scornful and bitter laugh.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How is this, then?&rdquo; cried Leslie; &ldquo;is murder so light a crime that a man
like this does not shrink from it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The country,&rdquo; whispered Lucas, &ldquo;is indeed in a fearful state. The rights
of property no longer exist among us. That fellow&mdash;because he lost
his farm&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stop, sir!&rdquo; cried Owen, fiercely; &ldquo;I will deny nothing of my guilt&mdash;but
lay not more to my charge than is true. Want and misery have brought me
low&mdash;destitution and recklessness still lower&mdash;but if I swore to
have your life this night, it was not for any vengeance of my own.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ha! then there is a conspiracy!&rdquo; cried Lucas, hastily. &ldquo;We must have it
out of you&mdash;every word of it&mdash;or it will go harder with
yourself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Owen&rsquo;s only reply was a bitter laugh; and from that moment, he never
uttered another word. All Lucas&rsquo;s threats, all Leslie&rsquo;s entreaties, were
powerless and vain. The very allusion to becoming an informer was too
revolting to be forgiven, and he firmly resolved to brave any and every
thing, rather than endure the mere proposal.
</p>
<p>
They returned to Galway as soon as the post-boys had succeeded in
repairing the accidental breakage of the harness, which led to the
opportune appearance of the landlord and his agent in the hut; Owen
accompanying them without a word or a gesture.
</p>
<p>
So long as Lucas was present, Owen never opened his lips; the dread of
committing himself, or in any way implicating one amongst his companions,
deterred him; but when Leslie sent for him, alone, and asked him the
circumstances which led him to the eve of so great a crime, he confessed
all&mdash;omitting nothing, save such passages as might involve others&mdash;and
even to Leslie he was guarded on this topic.
</p>
<p>
The young landlord listened with astonishment and sorrow to the peasant&rsquo;s
story. Never till now did he conceive the mischiefs neglect and
abandonment can propagate, nor of how many sins mere poverty can be the
parent. He knew not before that the very endurance of want can teach
another endurance, and make men hardened against the terrors of the law
and its inflictions. He was not aware of the condition of his tenantry; he
wished them all well off and happy; he had no self-accusings of a grudging
nature, nor an oppressive disposition, and he absolved himself of any
hardships that originated with &ldquo;the agent.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The cases brought before his notice rather disposed him to regard the
people as wily and treacherous, false in their pledges and unmindful of
favours; and many, doubtless, were so; but he never inquired how far their
experience had taught them, that dishonesty was the best policy, and that
trick and subtlety are the only aids to the poor man. He forgot, above
all, that they had neither examples to look up to, nor imitate, and that
when once a people have become sunk in misery, they are the ready tools of
any wicked enough to use them for violence, and false enough to persuade
them, that outrage can be their welfare; and, lastly, he overlooked the
great fact, that in a corrupt and debased social condition, the evils
which, under other circumstances, would be borne with a patient trust in
future relief, are resented in a spirit of recklessness; and that men soon
cease to shudder at a crime, when frequency has accustomed them to discuss
its details.
</p>
<p>
I must not&mdash;I dare not dwell longer on this theme. Leslie felt all
the accusations of an awakened conscience. He saw himself the origin of
many misfortunes&mdash;of evils of whose very existence he never heard
before. Ere Owen concluded his sad story, his mind was opened to some of
the miseries of Ireland; and when he had ended, he cried, &ldquo;I will live at
home with ye, amongst ye all, Owen! I will try if Irishmen cannot learn to
know who is their true friend; and while repairing some of my own faults,
mayhap I may remedy some of theirs.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! why did you not do this before I came to my ruin?&rdquo; cried Owen, in a
passionate burst of grief; for the poor fellow all along had given himself
up for lost, and imagined, that his own plea of guilt must bring him to
the gallows. Nor was it till after much persuasion and great trouble, that
Leslie could reconcile him to himself, and assure him, that his own
fortunate repentance had saved him from destruction.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You shall go back to your mountain-cabin, Owen; you shall have your own
farm again, and be as happy as ever,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;The law must
deal with those who break it, and no one will go farther than myself to
vindicate the law; but I will also try if kindness and fair-dealing will
not save many from the promptings of their own hearts, and teach men that,
even here, the breach of God&rsquo;s commandments can bring neither peace nor
happiness.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
My object in this little story being to trace the career of one humble man
through the trials and temptations incident to his lot in life, I must not
dwell upon the wider theme of national disturbance. I have endeavoured&mdash;how
weakly, I am well aware&mdash;to shew, that social disorganisation, rather
than political grievances, are the source of Irish outrage; that neglect
and abandonment of the people on the part of those who stood in the
position of friends and advisers towards them, have disseminated evils
deeper and greater than even a tyranny could have engendered. But for this
desertion of their duties, there had been no loss of their rightful
influence, nor would the foul crime of assassination now stain the name of
our land. With an educated and resident proprietary, Ireland could never
have become what she now is; personal comfort, if no higher motive could
be appealed to, would have necessitated a watchful observance of the
habits of the people&mdash;the tares would have been weeded from the
wheat; the evil influence of bad men would not have been suffered to
spread its contagion through the land.
</p>
<p>
Let me not be supposed for a moment as joining in the popular cry against
the landlords of Ireland. As regards the management of their estates, and
the liberality of their dealings with their tenantry, they are, of course
with the exceptions which every country exhibits, a class as blameless,
and irreproachable as can be found any where&mdash;their real dereliction
being, in my mind, their desertion of the people. To this cause, I
believe, can be traced every one of the long catalogue of disasters to
which Ireland is a prey: the despairing poverty, reckless habits,
indifference to the mandates of the law, have their source here. The
impassioned pursuit of any political privilege, which they are given to
suppose will alleviate the evils of their state, has thrown them into the
hands of the demagogue, and banded them in a league, which they assume to
be National. You left them to drift on the waters, and you may now be
shipwrecked among the floating fragments!
</p>
<p>
My tale is ended. I have only one record more to add. The exercise of the
law, assisted by the energy and determination of a fearless and resident
landlord, at length suppressed outrage and banished those who had been its
originators. Through the evidence of Gavan Daly, whose treachery had been
already suspected, several of the leaders were found guilty, and met the
dreadful penalty of their crimes. The fact of an informer having been
found amongst them, did, however, far more to break up this unholy league
than all the terrors of the law, unassisted by such aid; but it was long
before either peace or happiness shed their true blessings on that land:
mutual distrust, the memory of some lost friend, and the sad conviction of
their own iniquity, darkened many a day, and made even a gloomier depth
than they had ever known in their poverty.
</p>
<p>
There came, however, a reverse for this. It was a fine day in spring&mdash;the
mountain and the lake were bright in the sunshine&mdash;the valley, rich
in the promise of the coming year, was already green with the young wheat&mdash;the
pleasant sounds of happy labour rose from the fields fresh-turned by the
plough&mdash;the blue smoke curled into thin air from many a cabin, no
longer mean-looking and miserable as before, but with signs of comfort
around, in the trim hedge of the little garden and the white walls that
glistened in the sun.
</p>
<p>
Towards the great mountain above the lake, however, many an eye was turned
from afar, and many a peasant lingered to gaze upon the scene which now
marked its rugged face.
</p>
<p>
Along the winding path which traced its zigzag course from the lake-side
to the little glen where Owen&rsquo;s cabin stood, a vast procession could be
seen moving on foot and some on horseback. Some, in country cars, assisted
up the steep ascent by men&rsquo;s strong shoulders; others, mounted in twos and
threes upon some slow-footed beast; but the great number walking, or
rather, clambering their way&mdash;for in their eagerness to get forward,
they, each moment, deserted the path to breast the ferny mountain-side.
The scarlet cloaks of the women, as they fluttered in the wind, and their
white caps, gave a brilliancy to the picture, which, as the masses emerged
from the depth of some little dell and disappeared again, had all the
semblance of some gorgeous panorama. Nor was eye the only sense gladdened
by the spectacle&mdash;for even in the valley could be heard the clear
ringing laughter as they went along, and the wild cheer of merriment that
ever and anon burst forth from happy hearts, while, high above all, the
pleasant sounds of the bagpipe rose, as, seated upon an ass, and entrusted
to the guidance of a boy, the musician moved along; his inspiriting
strains taken advantage of at every spot of level ground, by some merry
souls, who would not &ldquo;lose so much good music.&rdquo;

</div>
<p>
As the head of the dense column wound its way upward, one little group
could be seen by those below, and were saluted by many a cheer and the
waving of handkerchiefs. These were a party, whose horses and gear seemed
far better than the rest; and among them rode a gentleman mounted on a
strong pony,-his chief care was bestowed less on his own beast, than in
guiding that of a young country girl, who rode beside him. She was
enveloped in a long blue cloak of dark cloth, beneath which she wore a
white dress; a white ribbon floated through her dark hair, too; but in her
features and the happy smile upon her lip, the bride was written more
palpably than in all these.
</p>
<p>
High above her head, upon a pinnacle of rock, a man stood, gazing at the
scene; at his side a little child of some four or five years old, whose
frantic glee seemed perilous in such a place, while his wild accents drew
many an upward glance from those below, as he cried&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;See, Nony, see! Mary is coming to us at last!&rdquo; This, too, was a &ldquo;St.
Patrick&rsquo;s Eve,&rdquo; and a happy one.&mdash;May Ireland see many such!

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
